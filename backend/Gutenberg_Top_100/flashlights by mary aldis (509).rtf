reason her secret a little girl i city sketches go forth now moods and metres sing your song and tell your story you have companioned me through hours grave and gay what will you say to him whose curious hand shall turn these pages soon all my joy in setting forth my vagrant thoughts shall pass into the silence soon i shall be one with the mystery my book upon some quiet shelf beneath your touch shall wake perhaps and speak again my wonder my delight my questioning before the night and as you read somewhere afar i shall be singing singing the barber shop i spend my life in a warren of worried men in and out and to and fro and up and down in electric elevators they rush about and speak each other hurrying on to finish the deal hurrying home to wash and eat and sleep hurrying to love a little maybe between the dark and dawn or cuddle a tired child who blinks to see his father i hurry too but with a sense that life is hurrying faster and will catch up with me right in the middle of our furious activity two soft voiced barbers in a little room white tiled and fresh and smelling deliciously flourish their glittering tools and smile and barb and talk about the war and stocks and the honolulu earthquake with equal impartiality i like to go there time seems slow and patient while they tuck me up in white and hover over me the room gives north and west and the sunset sky lights the grey river to a ribbon of glory where silhouetted tugs like tooting beetles fuss about their smoky businesses besides in that high place no curious passer by can see my ignominious bald spot treated with a tonic nor can a lady stop and bow to me my chin in lather as happened once so i go there often and even take a book there s another person all in white who comes and goes and manicures your nails on application one can read with one hand while she does the other because i feel that life is hurrying me along with horrid haste soon to desert me utterly i used to take my inferno in my pocket and reflect on what might happen were i among the usurers one day a low pitched voice broke in i listened vaguely what was the woman saying please listen for a moment mister brown i ve done your nails for almost half a year you ve never looked at me i looked at that and sure enough the girl was young and round and sweet she coloured as i turned to her and looked away i waited silently enjoying her confusion the words had been shot out at me and now apparently she wished them back what do you want i said again a silence while she rubbed away i opened my inferno with an ironic glance towards paradiso waiting just beyond well rub away my girl i thought you opened up go on the book provoked her i m straight she said i never talked like this before the fellows that come round good lord showin me two pink ticket corners stickin out the pocket of their vest say kid tonight you know thinkin i ll tumble for a ticket to a show they make me sick they do boobs like that you re different i want to know what s in that book you read i want to hear you talk oh mister i m so lonesome but i m straight i tell you i read too every evening in my room but i can t ever find the books you have i expect you think i m horrid to talk like this but i got some things by an englishman from the public library say they were queer he thinks a woman has a right to say out if she likes a man he thinks they do the looking because they want oh mister i m so terribly ashamed i ll die when i get home an yet i had to speak i d be awful awful good to you if only please please don t think i m like don t think i m one o them whatever you say don t don t think that she stopped and turned to hide her crying i looked at her again looked at her young wet eyes at her abashed bent head looked at her sweet deft hands busy with mine but not for nothing were my grandfather and four of my uncles elders in the sixth presbyterian church situated on the avenue oh not for nothing was i led to squirm on those green rep seats one day in seven and now the white tiled sweetly smelling barber shop is lost to me what a pity love in the loop they sat by the fountain at a table for two the traditional couple an awkward ill dressed girl with a lovely skin and a country smile and the man who was paying for her dinner there they were exploiter and exploited i could see only his back clad in grey tweed his neck rolled over his collar in a thick red fold and his hands which he waved about were fat and white with shiny nails and diamond rings i wondered if he was offering her better clothes for the girl looked troubled her shirt waist wasn t fresh her skirt was draggled and her feet curled up under the chair shifted themselves uneasily seeking cover for most lamentable shoes but oh her skin soft rose and the delicate white of summer mist her hair was the brown of hazelnuts after a frost glinting to saffron as she turned her head quickly from side to side like an enquiring dove soon oysters came she eyed them with distrust then ate one thoughtfully and made a face he seemed concerned and beckoned the waiter to remove the dish asking if she d rather have a country sausage she showed her baby teeth in a happy smile and sausages were brought she ate them all while he watched her enviously putting a little white pellet in some water for his second course champagne was set before them and he filled her glass while he turned his bottom side up she sipped and made another face and choked then tried again and laughed i do believe it s good she said and finished the glass holding it out for more you d best look out i heard him say as he slid his hand along the table cloth she cringed away oh please please don t she said but he hitched his chair softly around the table i watched it all wondering miserably if it was my duty to warn the girl and whether she would prove clinging if i did finally to secure her hands he turned himself my god what a mug his beady eyes over his glistening cheeks blinked like a hurrying pig s his protuberent lips wiggled themselves in amourous expectancy while little beads of ecstasy bedewed his brow i turned my chair around and raised my paper suddenly i heard her cry oh mister that fuzzy stuff you made me drink my head and she grabbed her coat and slithered along the floor to the front door calling over her shoulder don t come i want some air i ll be back in a minute or two after a startled forward step he settled back and called the waiter who hurried to busy himself expectantly with the inevitable reckoning by the time it was ready mr amourous one was deep in the stock reports and dead to the world the waiter stood on one foot and then on the other finally wandering off after some twenty minutes of troubled scrutiny the paper was laid down and mr amourous looked at his watch and jumped then turned the bill and burrowed in his pocket pulling out change next came a leather wallet and then what a bellowing rent the astonished air eight hundred dollars gone he yelled hi get that girl i tell you get that girl but nobody stirred exploiter and exploited converse they were two disembodied heads on bath cabinets just like une t te de femme by rodin in a show save that each head was topped by a ruffled rubber cap one rose lined grey one brown they were two female heads and yet they were not pretty at least not then they fixed their level fronting eyes on a sanitary wall in front of them and waited the bath attendant turned a crank consulted a thermometer and vanished time draggled warmly by finally one head heaved a heavy sigh and turned itself and looked at the other head which bit its lip and frowned since names seem meaningless when souls converse let us call these souls quite simply grey and brown the one that heaved and turned itself was brown the one that bit its lip was grey are you pretending that you didn t see me queried brown oh no said grey i ve been meaning to have a talk with you said brown and why not now and why not now said grey you may as well understand continued brown you ve got to give him up him up said grey that s what i said said brown you very well know his duty is to me i bear his name i ve given him seven children and a step all likely boys he s very fond of them you know i know said grey well what have you got to say brown trembled on why don t you speak grey murmured softly isn t it hot in these brown looked at her and laughed you re pretty cool she said but i d like to tell you here and straight and now i m tired of nonsense tired of worrying and very very tired of him and you of him and me said grey i ve cried and then i ve laughed and said i didn t care said whimpering brown i ve dressed myself up beautifully and then again i d slump said sniffling brown but nothing mattered if he came home bright and gay of course i d know he d been with you and if he came home different then i d know he wished he were so gradually it didn t matter much which way he was and then i thought i d try and keep the boys from knowing so i d make up lies and plan with seven and the step it took considerable planning but luckily the little ones don t notice and now i ve got you here i m going to have my say your say said grey i m going to get your promise here and now to give him up for good do you understand for good said grey oh yes i understand or else and beetling brown grew dark and terrible you ll be the co respondent in a suit a suit said grey i said a suit said brown i mean a suit moreover as you haven t said a word i ll bring it soon it soon said grey and then the attendant came looked at the clock and then the thermometer got sheets and led them out unless said brown oh yes unless said grey window wishing oh yes we get off regular by half past six and six on saturdays sister an i go marketing on saturday nights everything s down besides there s sunday comin you can sleep oh my how you can sleep no mother shakin you to

sundays yesterday we thought we d go down window wishin and what do you think just as she d picked a lovely silver dress sister jerked my arm then all of a sudden there she was cryin and snifflin in her handkerchief standin there on the sidewalk and what do you think she said i d like to kill the woman that wears that gown i tell you i was scared she looked so queer but she s all right today oh thank you two o clock next saturday the tenth i ll put it down a shampoo and a wave you said i ll keep the time good morning a little old woman there s a twinkling little old woman brings me sandwiches after my turkish bath her cheeks are brown and pink and her eyes behind her gold bowed spectacles smile in a curious fashion as if to say i know you re worried about that letter in the pocket of your dress hanging out there but i ll take care of it she sets the tray down on a chair beside my couch and trots away to another languid lady in a sheet and as i fall asleep she says to me don t worry honey i ll take care of it perhaps it s only in my dreams she says it but anyway she s there once after she had hooked me up she raised her sober dress to show me that she too could wear a lace trimmed petticoat and a dainty thing it was with tiny rosebuds festooned all around she dropped her skirt and laughed i ve got one too she said this was uncanny so i said good day next time i went i met him at the door with a market basket it seems he brought the dainties every day she made up into sandwiches for us who lolled about i took a look at him a delicate chiselled face with soft blue eyes under his chin from ear to ear a fringe of yellow down around a bald spot curls of whity gold he blinked a little as she gave him charges then wandered thoughtfully away clutching his basket he wore a black frock coat too big for him and on his head a round black hat like a french cur s so that was why she wore the petticoat and smiled so knowingly but how she worked i wouldn t work like that perhaps she kept that little thing for pleasuring well this is a woman s world why not if so be that he pleased her the steamy scented atmosphere that day seemed teeming with intrigue i looked at the strapping bare legged wench who brought my sheet enquiring mutely have you got a lover and when a person next me roused herself to ask the time i thought ah ha he s waiting it chanced when sandwiches were brought i found myself alone with her of the spectacles and petticoat i wanted to go to sleep but i wanted more to find out how she got a lover and how she kept him after some skirmishing i asked straight out was that your husband with the market basket my husband s dead she said and grinned and took a chair beside my couch who is he then i said he s mine she answered mine i paid for him five hundred dollars cool and now he likes me i sat up at that you paid for him i gulped why yes he lived up stairs you know his heart is bad he hadn t any cash he got hauled up on a breach of promise suit i paid it for him now he lives with me she emphasized her me triumphantly i looked her over certainly there was something there of vividness of quick vitality he and his funny hat and goldy curls well anything may be are you happy now i asked she smiled and bridled the business pays she said you ladies pay good prices for your food and then the tips besides he gets the things for me and brings em fresh then what do you suppose he does the rest of the time his heart is bad you know writes verses all day long for the sunday papers mostly they don t get in but every now and then he gets two dollars i bought him an underwood last week he was so pleased only the punctuation isn t right it isn t a second hand cost me a hundred and twenty five i saved it up the bell rang and she rose say please don t tell them anything about about my husband and she vanished ii design if all the world s a stage why do we know naught of the drama we the actors play are we but puppets we who come and go mumbling our parts through life s quick passing day what if some master hand design the show planning a spacious pattern cunningly time color drifting human shapes all go into a great discordant harmony let this one s part be cast in delicate grey let this a heavy purple shadow be here let there come one clear cold bluish ray and here but hold one actor suddenly in desperate rebellion cries his part a scarlet tumult from his own hot heart the world cry joy light and love i crave and shall discover life s wild adventure opening to my will high thought and brave the rapture of a lover the vision gleaming from yon western hill beyond my present sight there lies some sweet allure some crested glory waiting to be won shimmering in light beautiful and sure beckoning bright hands that call me on i know not where it lies nor whither i go nor how the way is paved with pleasure or with pain but the search is in my eyes and the dust upon my brow shall turn to aureoled gold when i attain oh old old hope unfulfilled desire pitiful the faith beautiful the fire know soul who criest thy gleaming from afar thy quest of wild adventure thy sweet far star shall be the bitter path to a high stern goal so bow thy head to thine own soul brown sands my stallion impatiently stamps at my side into the desert far we two shall ride brown sands around us fly winds whistle free the desert is sharing gladness with me the madness of motion is mine again forgotten forever sorrow and pain into the desert far swiftly we flee knowing the passionate joy of the free seeking swift like the lark out of the dark one cometh singing silent in flight out of the night answer is winging forth to the dawn leaps like a fawn a cry of high greeting into the sun two that have run seeking are meeting may a prayer is forming on my tightened lips lord grant that i may keep my soul from hate i have known love i have been pitiful lord i would keep my grief compassionate pain maddened cries i hear from out the sea upstaring at me faces of the dead those silent bodies seem to call aloud those silent souls are still and comforted and we are here to bear the weight of pain oh keep the poison from its awful task lord let me be as they are ere i hate let me love on this this is what i ask however long the way there is a turning somewhere beyond the storm there lies a land where peace abides where love shall live again and men shall greet with friendly outstretched hand while little children laugh and women weep with happiness oh lord until that hour keep thou my hope keep thou my tenderness keep thou my trust in thy far seeing power watchers i watch the eastern sky for a sign of dawn long delayed such stillness is around that every separate sense is twice attuned twice powerful and loneliness enwraps me like a sea into whose unplumbed depths i must go down a sea unsatisfied where drifting shapes wan eyed reach forth wan arms towards them who pause to look at their own souls mirrored upon the sea somewhere a loon sends forth its weary cry across the dark oh wailing bird i know i know i think tonight the soul of the world is desolate and you and i its watchers yet cease oh cease the night air quivers and resounds to bear your cry across the sleeping lake and i would have your silence while i make my own complaint for i would ask why we who have so little space to live and love and wonder must go down into eternal mystery alone and i would know why since that awful loneliness must be we go about as strangers here on earth and meet and laugh and mock and part again with never a look into each others eyes with never a question of each others pain so even as i hear your melancholy plaint across the sleeping lake i send my questing cry across the world and as i watch and listen through the stillness there comes to me an echoing and a far reverberation of the many who have gone into the limitless mystery and thus they speak we too have known your questing we too have stretched our arms forth to the night and clasped its nothingness we too have lived and loved and wondered for a little space and then gone onward and we seek across the silence to send our voices out out across the dark is it your voice i hear oh far strange bird or is it theirs theirs who have gone onward alone and unafraid is there an answer i may sometime find or is it that our lips are dumb our eyes are blind when love would come now faint light comes upon the shadowy sky the east is waking and the day begins you send your cry across the quivering lake i send my question out across the world we watch we two alone to maurice browne on his creation of capulchard in cloyd head s grotesques shadows are round me as the dawn breaks shadows with long white swaying arms and anguished faces i see them meet and touch and part crying their desire while a bitter figure moulds them in a shifting decoration which enchants eludes and maddens imprisoning my dreams now they plead and droop and cower holding wan hands to whatever gods there be praying intercession from the malign enchantment of their decorative doom whence they weep their silent tears oh draughtsman terrible who puts out the moon and stars who smiles and waves a hand and puppet hearts are broken let them love only a moment in a theater only a moment under the stars all there may be before the end let them love the show is over the swaying puppets of a little longer hour go forth and cry out their desire to a master of decoration their god unseen and he like you smiles puts forth a hand and blots the moon and stars and tears the glory from the earth and sky and cries back to your places fools you shall not love prayers day by day i tread my appointed way greeting the sun with dutiful intent seeing his slow decline into the west watching draw near my night of quietude each day i see fade slowly back to join those other days unlived unloved unmourned that have passed by in grave processional with never a golden one to mark their passing sometimes at night i ask the friendly stars tell me what do i here why have i breath and this fair body in a world of shadows why do i live but the stars shine silently and make no answer sometimes i ask of god dear lord i love thee well but thou art far away couldst thou not send to me someone on earth to love so should i love thee more but god sends no one sometimes i ask the far tumultuous sea oh sea give me of your great beating heart let me be swept on the whirlwind let me be lulled and rocked let me be storm tossed made mad then let me perish but the sea roars on unheeding so day by day i tread my appointed way greeting the sun with dutiful intent seeing his slow decline into the west watching draw near my night of quietude my boat and i my staunch little boat is tugging at its moorings eager to be free eager to slip out on the great waters beyond the returning tides out to the unknown sea my staunch little boat unwilling prisoner frets and pulls at the anchor chain while the wind calls come come i will bear you out to the unknown sea long time my boat and i have plied the harbour on little busy journeyings intent long time with wistful gazing i have listened to the calling the winds with buffeting caress the waves with ceaseless urge calling rest rest rest rest on an unknown sea and now we are away into the mystery quietly the swaying waters rock and beguile and soothe us that we may not know we are so far away along the shore are hands stretched out what would you with me now oh pleading hands i come not to you any more i have set my sail out to the unknown sea would you have me stay adventuring would you have me come again to be amidst you with alien eyes and a heart unquiet oh cease your crying i come not back long time my little boat and i have fretted at the mooring long time we have looked out beyond the bar with a great questioning and a great wonder and then an hour came which held the parting and we slipped out out to the unknown sea the hands stretched out have faded from my sight the shore is dim the mountains fade into the limitless blue only the wind and the sea companion me singing rest rest rest rest on an unknown sea pictures i saw a little boy go hurrying towards an old man nodding in the sun he tweaked him by the sleeve and gazed at him with insistent frowning eyes asking his question the old man blinked and muttered and the child let go his sleeve and drooped and turned away i saw a mother counselling her daughter about her lover and the girl was sullen looking from out averted eyes for means to go to him and the mother bowed her head and turned away i saw two lovers meet with hungry arms and kiss and speak and kiss again then speak with challenging tones and fall apart i saw them turn with tightened lips made dumb and eyes quick quenched and dark slowly they went their ways i saw a woman kneeling in a church her head was bent upon worn hands clasped tightly her dress was black and poor after a time she rose and shook her head then beat her fist upon the rail and clattered noisily down the aisle at the door she paused narrowed her eyes at the holy water and passed on forward singing listen girl stand there near me give me your two fluttering hands then listen little hurrying human beings are important and significant only in so far as they can stand alone most of them stand sideways propping themselves against this brother or that brother or this sister or that sister leaving each prop only to carom swiftly to the next now shall not every one of these sometime discover if his prop fall down he falls as well listen beautiful child i would carve my destiny alone as a keen eyed captain steers his ship by the light of the far north star awake alert alone so laughing girl whom i call to my side hear i stand by myself i can love aye with a fierce flame but i love none so much no man no woman that his passing or his forgetfulness shall undo me i and my soul stand beyond the need of comforting none has power to make me helpless incomplete beholden now bright child golden girl warm woman with the fluttering hands whom desire has brought will you come to my arms i will give you love no other lover can give you love like mine come ah that is well quick your mouth and then forward singing but if you had not come laughing girl i would have gone forward singing alone barberries you say i touch the barberries as a lover his mistress what a curious fancy one must be delicate you know they have bitter thorns you say my hand is hurt oh no it was my breast it was crushed and pressed i mean why yes of course of course there is a bright drop isn t there right on my finger just the color of a barberry but it comes from my heart do you love barberries in the autumn when the sun s desire touches them to a glory of crimson and gold i love them best then there is something splendid about them they are not afraid of being warm and glad and bold they flush joyously like a cheek under a lover s kiss they bleed cruelly like a dagger wound in the breast they flame up madly for their little hour knowing they must die do you love barberries two paths today it seemed god bent to me and said pilgrim you are weary are you unaware you have two paths and i answered wondering tell me of them that i may choose and god said you have set your face towards a far goal to be attained only with heartbreak of endeavor it is written should you choose this path many times you shall faint and falter raising yourself with bruised hands and bewildered eyes and when at last you see the ending of the journey before eternal silence comes you shall hear a little clamouring and tinkling of men s voices but you will smile quietly and turn away and the other path i asked in a different voice god said the other path is short it ends but a little way ahead there is no attainment no acclaim only darkness quiet rest from desire and memory in the heart of the beloved and i answered i have chosen when you come there was a girl with him for a time she took him to her room when he was desolate and warmed him and took care of him one day he could not find her for many weeks he walked constantly in that locality in search of her from life of francis thompson when you come tonight to our small room you will look and listen i shall not be there you will cry out your dismay to the unheeding gods you will wait and look and listen i shall not be there there is a part of you i love more than your hands in mine at rest there is a part of you i love more than your lips upon my breast there is a part of you i wound even in my caress there is a part of you withheld i may not possess there is a part of you i hate your need of me when you would be alone alone and free when you come tonight to our small room you will look and listen i shall not be there rest often i have listened curiously to the sound of a simple word all seemed to know and wondered why i could not find its meaning often i have dreamed of that great nothingness that silence which shall come and asked if that were rest to the unquiet sea i have gone down seeking companionship calling out to the beating waves do you too ask for rest of the wind and the rain singing their requiem over dead summer i have asked you will be quiet soon where do you find rest to the white moon sailing serenely i have said you are dim and old and cold have you found rest to the eternal sun uprising solemnly i have cried out and this new day you bring will it hold my rest once to my heart tumultuous there came a gleaming a far prophecy that like a fairy benison descending gave answer to my questioning strange message lit with wonderment deep in the city s labyrinthine heart there shall be moonlight for us and white song so ran the words and like a diapason of sweet sound across the stillness echoing profound there crept the promise rest and then you came i turned to find your hand your arms your breast deep in the city s labyrinthine heart you held me close at rest moriturus te saluto when one goes hence by his own hand alone we look aside in a hushed tone we say what pain has gone before the sudden end but i shall go because i know no longer can the earth hold any other joy for me like this one night we had together only one in all the years for all my tears the gods have given me only one night and it is over now i am glad to go into the silence i have breathed the heights i should but know the level ways and paths of little valleys i will not this should be so beloved remember it is because of happiness not sorrow that i go from the far coolness of eternity i shall look out to the grave stars singing flashlights the winter dusk creeps up the avenue with biting cold behind bright window panes in gauzy garments waxen ladies smile as shirt sleeved men hustle them off their pedestals for the night along the avenue a girl comes hurrying holding her shawl she stops to look in at the window oh gee she says look at the chiffon muff a whimpering dog falters up to cringe against her skirt a man in his shirt sleeves lolls against a tree his feet stick out his hands lie on the grass palms up he stares ahead now and again he turns himself as from the enshrouding darkness forms emerge dragging their feet arms interlocked wan faces raised to the flare of light sometimes these kiss scream in brief laughter or throw their bodies prone on the welcoming earth the man watches them then turns his head gets himself upon his feet and walks away candles toppling sideways in tomato cans sputter and sizzle at head and foot the gaudy patterns of a patch work quilt lie smooth and straight save where upswelling over a silent shape a man in high boots stirs something on a rusty stove round and round and round as a new cry like a bleating lamb s pierces his brain after a time the man busies himself with hammer and nails and rough hewn lumber but fears to strike a blow outside the moonlight sleeps white upon the plain and the bark of a coyote shrills across the night a woman rocking rocking rocking a small hand waving nestling outside lights blurred to starriness and summer rain little waves slap softly and monotonously against the pier a triangle of geese honk by on the darkening sand fresh lines traced with a stick i am sorry forgive and a little oblong mound with a cross of twigs near by a girl s hat and dainty scarf a smell of musk comes to him pungently through the darkness on the screen scenes from foreign lands released by the censor shimmer in cool black and white historic information he shifts his seat sideways sideways a seeking hand creeps to another hand and a leaping flame illuminates the historic information within the room sounds of weeping low and hushed without a man beautiful with the beauty of young strength holds pitifully to the handle of the door he hiccoughs and turns away while a hand organ plays the hours i spend with thee dear heart a pink feather atop of a greying white straw hat a peek a boo waist and skirt showing a line of stocking above white shoes stand in front of a judge who leans over a desk of golden oak and summons forward a sulky slouching boy you are required by this court says the judge to pay over to this woman one third of your weekly wage for the support of your innocent child and the clerk of the court calls out next on the docket floodgates the man dear try to understand i wish that you could see now i am free of all the fret and torment the little daily miseries of love that i can take you in my arms at night with a quick tenderness with a new delight yet go my way untroubled if i do not find you forgetting in my zest for many things there is a you i wonder if you can ever understand do you not know that i would go forth now to meet life s great adventuring alone i would be unloosed from why and wherefore i would not be stayed by sorrowing or rejoicing even the enchantment of your nearness or your touch at night is powerless any more to come between my loneliness and me they say that prisoners grow to love their chains so now after long years of bitter reaching out of crying to the winds and clasping only shadows of my dreaming i love my torment we are such old companions loneliness and i we have learned to ask but little of each other there is no longer any turning away with hurt averted eyes so beloved let me keep my loneliness for friend the only friend i trust when you and i first met and looked to each other s eyes our swift desire i gave with reckless hands my life into your keeping upon your eyes your words your body s grace i hung poor fool a tremble for you had power to blot the brightening day to irradiate the night with your sweet hands to lift me to the mountains where the spirits danced or drag me through a hell of furious pain and you would like to have that power again in your two hands oh no my little one no my pretty one henceforward for all your sighing you shall but have my sudden strong caresses my tenderness my love but know that out out out i go into the sun alone the woman so man of mine i may henceforward ask only your strong caresses i am your little one i am your pretty one even your beloved now that you are free of little fret and torment i may give you pleasuring but no more pain is that your meaning i would be clear at last oh man of mine we are standing face to face now let there shine the search light of our speech across the night of silence before us two there lie dim years for traversing behind a mist through which we long time groped with futile hands and now today we meet dear do i not know that there were gleams across the darkness swift lightenings towards which we onward pressed as for an instant seeing our far quest within our grasp perhaps these were your beckoning hands your dancing spirits on the mountain peaks but not for long we saw them and now today it seems that i must find what shall be done when you go out alone into the sun i have so often watched your silent face your quiet mouth your smooth white brow and longed for speech i have so often wished to tell of pent up treasures in my breast you could not find i would have given you such golden wealth had you but come had you but said i want your all but you were dumb you went your ways silently and never asked my gift dear day by day i lifted to your lips a chalice brimming with rich wine and you but sipped a little and turned away and the wine was spilled the years have passed there may not be upgathering of wasted days as seasons flushed and waned we have sown and reaped and harvested now what shall come i cannot go forth as you into the sun alone i cannot take my loneliness by the hand for chosen friend as you i am a woman and i want not tenderness not strong caresses only but the soul of you my man the man dear give me your hands look into my eyes and tell me if you can find the soul of me i think it has gone questing call it back recapture the wing d thing and i will give it gladly into your keeping but dear heart be fearful souls are delicate what if mine died long since what time it gave up seeking to find your own your eyes are wet forgive let there be no more hurting joy there has been in our meeting i would banish weeping let the still waters wash away pain into the sea of forgetting still may we look into each other s eyes still answer to the senses quick demand but as the years have marked us in their passing so must we go onward hand in hand still yet alone chloroform written in collaboration with arthur davison ficke a sickening odour treacherously sweet steals through my sense heavily above me leans an ominous shape fearful white robed hooded and masked in white the pits of his eyes peer like the portholes of an armoured ship merciless keen inhuman dark the hands alone are of my kindred their slender strength that soon shall press the knife silver and red now lingers slowly above me the last links with my human world the living daylight clouds and thickens flashes of sudden clearness stream before me and then a menacing wave of darkness swallows the glow with floods of vast and indeterminate grey but in the flashes i see the white form towering dim ominous like some apostate monk whose will unholy has renounced god and now in this most awful secret laboratory would wring from matter its stark and appalling answer at the gates of a bitter hell he stands to wrest with eager fierceness more of that dark forbidden knowledge wherefrom his soul draws fervor to deny the clouds have grown thicker they sway around me dizzying terrible gigantic pressing in upon me like a thousand monsters of the deep with formless arms i cannot push them back i cannot from far far off a voice i knew long ago sounds faintly thin and clear suddenly in a desperate rebellion i strive to answer i strive to call aloud but darkness chokes and overcomes me none may hear my soundless cry a depth abysmal opens receives enfolds engulfs me wherein to sink at last seems blissful even though to deeper pain o respite and peace of deliverance the silence lies over me like a benediction as in the earth s first pale creation morn among winds and waters holy i am borne as i longed to be borne i am adrift in the depths of an ocean grey like seaweed desiring solely to drift with the winds and waters i sway into their vast slow movements all the shores of being are laved by my tides i am drawn out toward spaces wonderful and holy where peace abides and into golden ons far away but over me where i swing slowly bodiless in the bodiless sea very far oh very far away glimmeringly hangs a ghostly star toward whose pure beam i must flow resistlessly well do i know its ray it is the light beyond the worlds of space by groping sorrowing man yet never known the goal where all men s blind and yearning desire has vainly longed to go and has not gone where eternity has its blue walled dwelling place and the crystal ether opens endlessly to all the recessed corners of the world like liquid fire pouring a flood through the dimness revealingly where my soul shall behold and in lightness of wonder rise higher out of the shadow that long ago around me with mortality was furled i rise where have winds of the night never flown shaken with rapture is the vault of desire the weakness that binds like a shadow is gone the bonds of my capture are sundered with fire this is the hour when the wonders open the lightning winged spaces through which i fly accept me a power whose prisons are broken but the wonder wavers the light goes out i am in the void no more changes are imminent time with a million beating wings deafens the air in migratory flight like the roar of seas and is gone and a silence lasts deafeningly in darkness and perfect silence i wander groping in my agony far from the light lost in the upper ether unknown unknowable so nearly mine and the ages pass by me thousands each instant yet i feel them all to the last second of their dragging time thus have i striven always since the world began and when it dies i still must struggle the voice i knew so long ago like a muffled echo under the sea is coming nearer strong hands grip mine and words whose tones are warm with some forgotten consolation some unintelligible hope drag me upward in horrible mercy and the cold once familiar daylight glares into my eyes he stands there the white apostate monk speaking low lying words to soothe me and i lift my voice out of its vales of agony and laugh in his face mocking him with astonishment of wonder for he has denied and i have come so near so near to knowing then as his hand touches me gently i am drawn up from the lonely abysses and suffer him to lead me back into the green valleys of the living the beginning of the journey where are you dear what is it that i hold a shape a phantom who will not ease my pain o beloved my beloved what is it comes between our seeking arms lip to lip we press and breast to breast straining to overleap the barrier and all the while we know we are apart we know tomorrow we shall be more horribly alone do you remember when we first cried out each to each how the valleys rang with laughter and gay words and eager promises do you remember how we told each other pain was over that nothing now could come we could not still with kisses do you remember those first days when the world was lost in a dream and a forgetting and eternity was ours then as the years followed do you remember how we found that pain must be how heavy hearted we gazed bewildered into each other s eyes asking why one night you would not speak and when i pressed you for your cause of silence you said i tried to tell you once my heart s dim heaviness but you are a man you can never understand and then i saw that we were far away from one another for i had thought the same and after in a quick ache of sympathy we kissed and clung and then you slept i heard the little sobbing breaths like a hurt child s of a loneliness i had no power to soothe we asked so much we looked to each other as some look to god and when god came not and our lifted hands were empty we cried out that love was dead we have grown patient since and pitifully wise we see how little may be given and we are thankful lest there be nothing yet even when i lay my wearied head upon your knees and fall asleep to waken with your hand on my hot brow then when i thank god if there be a god for you we are apart yesterday i watched you protect the child against the winter cold warmly you wrapped him while his baby face laughed back at you from its frame of softest fur i think a great hand comes and wraps us so each in his loneliness as in an enfolding garment that we shall be ready to make our last great journeying alone as the years go onward little by little we turn and draw away from love s dominion little by little we loose the clinging hands that hinder from adventuring oftener and more often we go apart to ask ourselves the inevitable question the friends we seek are questioners who strive like us to cross with thoughts the illimitable void therefore dear give over trying to comfort give over the wish to yield me all i need once long ago i lost myself in you once long ago i was but part of you bereft without you mad for lack of you now i am i preparing to go onward when the end shall come alone iii stories in metre the prisoner we had a prisoner once the warden said who was no common man i could not say to make it clear where lay the difference and yet and yet something was there i know tell me of him i said drawing a chair knowing that in the old man s heart there lay many a story willingly he answered yet when all s said you ll know no more than i why his words puzzle me why when i pass his cell i always think that i can see his eyes his following eyes that seemed to ask over and over again some kind of question he thought a moment then began his story as if by careful measuring of his words he tried to make me see what he found dim you know the row of cells he said they built to make the fourth row round the hollow square they front the east and so i put him there i d hardly like to say what was the reason it seems so foolish but the day he came just as the big door opened i had seen him turn his head and this is what he said and it is i i who have loved the dawn a queer thing wasn t it i suppose he thought that he would never see it any more it s strange how little things come back to you i can remember when he saw his cell he bent his head making a kind of greeting then quickly stepped across and glanced around and this is what i have to call my home was what he thought i guess it always seems to sicken me somehow to show em in the hopeful ones the most i know so well how soon the eager look will disappear but tell me what he was in prison for i said and met the old man s quick what for oh well there wasn t room enough outside why do you want to know what does it matter he was no common man you d think by now i d stop my foolish bothering i m used enough god knows to tangled human threads oh what s the use to try and tell it now i m such a fool i can t go by his cell without the wondering clutching at me here he laid his hand upon his breast i thought his mind had dwelt too long with pain and now his fancies troubled him mad then perhaps i asked and saw my blundering words had been salt to a wound he turned away and said no no he was not that not mad and stepped beside a shelf of little useless things fumbling among them presently he turned and placed within my hands a woman s picture i took it silently afraid to comment think what you please he said for i don t know as no one came to take away his things i kept the picture it was dear to him a gentle woman s face looked up at me a tender face lips parted young grave eyes i seemed to see within their depths a question and turned to meet the old man s twisted smile nodding he murmured so you see it too then took the picture from me and began again though haltingly his troubled tale at first he read and spoke and ate his food as if he thought he would not be here long and must be patient often he would ask what time it was or if it rained or shone begging for outside news and when i brought letters or papers seized them greedily and strained his eyes to get the contents quickly sometimes he d hail me as i passed along with such a flow of eager questioning talk i wondered anyone so rich in words could bear his solitude and not go mad with silence but our prison rules are stern i shot the bolts that dulled that silver voice and now i hear it echoing down the years the old man rose and made a little pretence to put the picture back upon the shelf well time went on seating himself he said and as i made my rounds each day i thought the prisoner seemed to draw himself away not rudely more as if he could not break the current of his thoughts and up and down he d walk they all do that but he as if he had some light inside his mind don t think i m crazy but it s hard to put in words sometimes i d have my little try to break across the distance with a sudden smile he d lay his hand upon me yes i know i know and so would push me to the door i feared to go to him and yet i loved the man as if he d been my son i knew the end was coming soon my heart was sore but i was powerless one thing alone could wean him from his strange expectancy a little written word that came half yearly i knew that it was due and when it came i beat upon his door i had the letter slowly he turned to meet me and i stopped seeing it was too late then from my hands he took the letter lifting it silently the way a priest lifts up the sacrament then gave it slowly back to me and said why bring me bread so little little bread why eke my life along so grudgingly take back the letter i am far away keep back the bread and i shall sooner know and followed by his eyes i left the cell and soon he died no no he was not mad but only one to whom the dawn was real ellie she came to do my nails came in my door and stood before me waiting a great big lummox of a girl a continent her dress was rusty black and scant her hat a melancholy jumble of basement counter bargains her sullen eyes like a whipped animal s shone out between her silly bulging cheeks and puffy forehead she dropped her coat upon a chair and waited then at a word busied herself with files and delicate scissors sweet smelling oils and my ten finger tips she proved so deft and silent i bade her come again and twice a week while summer dawned and flushed and waned she used me in her parasitic trade the dress grew rustier the hat more melancholy and ellie fatter each time she came i wondered as she worked if thought lay anywhere behind that queer uncouthness she had a trick of seizing with her eyes each passing thing an insatiate greediness for something out of reach and yet she seemed enwrapped in a kind of solemn patience large aloof and waiting we hardly ever spoke i could not think of anything worth saying one does not chatter with a continent finally it was homing time the seashore town was raw and desolate and idlers flitted the last day ellie came her calm was gone she had been crying fat people never ought to cry it s awful the hot drops fell upon my hand while ellie dropped the scissors suddenly and sniffed and blew and sobbed in disconcerting and unreserved abandonment i said the usual things i would have patted her but for the grease but ellie was not comforted not until the storm was spent and only little catching breaths were left i got the reason i m so fat she gulped so awful awful fat the boys won t look at me and then it came the stammered passionate cry could i not help could i not find a medicine we talked and talked and when at dusk she went a teary smile hovered a moment on her mouth and in those sullen swollen eyes a little hope perhaps i did not know the city and its interests soon engulfed me a letter or two a doctor s vague advice to bant and exercise and ellie and her woes passed from my mind until as summer dawned again i heard that she was dead a curious letter written stiffly from ellie s mother told me i was invited to the funeral by wish of the deceased wondering i travelled to the little town where the sea beat and groaned and sorrowed endlessly and made my way down the steep street to ellie s door her mother met me in the hall and motioned she wanted you to see her then ushered me into an awful place the parlor a place of emerald plush and golden oak set round with pride and symmetry and in the midst a black and silver coffin ellie s coffin raising the lid she pointed and i looked somewhere in florence mino da fiesole has made a tomb where deathless beauty lies with upturned face two gentle hands palms meeting touch with their pointed forefingers a delicate chin and over the vibrant body clings a white robe enshrouding chastely warm curving lines of adolescent grace no sleeper this the figure glows alert awake aware as if some sudden ecstacy had stolen life and held imprisoned there the moment of attainment rapt imperishable and fair even so lay ellie and when from somewhere far i heard the mother s voice i listened vacantly the woman chattered on the dress you know white chiffon like a wedding dress i never knew she had it she must a made it by herself it s queer it fitted perfectly an her all thin like that she must a thought then black robed relatives came streaming in to look at ellie i watched them start and glance around for explanation the mother pinched my arm don t ask me anything now she whispered come back tonight then old old words were sung and prayed and droned while everybody dutifully cried and when the village parson rhythmically proclaimed and this mortal shall put on immortality with a great welcoming and a great lightening i knew at last the ancient affirmation when evening came i found the mother sitting amidst her golden oak and plush in a kind of isolated stateliness she led me in twas the stuff she took that did it she began i never knew till after she was dead the bottles in the woodshed hundreds of em all labelled caldwell s great obesity cure warranted safe and rapid oh ain t it awful and she fell to crying miserably but wasn t she real pretty in her coffin and then she cried again and clung to me the park bench a stranger a man a woman the pallid night wind touched their burning cheeks with fetid breath whispered a dim distress and flickered out while whirling insects danced their crazy steps with death around the light the stranger the night is hot and the crowds intolerable may i sit here between you on this bench the man i s pose the bench is free to anybody the stranger i ve been walking up and down and wondering if i should speak you sat here silently you two i could not tell what troubled you the woman i guess i was thinkin mister i didn t know

the stranger you have my promise the woman more n a year ago it was i seen him first an twasn t long before i thought a lot and so did he he said he d take a flat and furnish it and we d keep house

a while she had the children there are two you know but i was pretty bad i hated it but there it was and every day a fight and oftener and oftener i d lose one day she went away and took the children they served some papers on me i was drunk and didn t care but pretty soon i knew that she had gone for good a lawyer came and talked to me after she d talked to him and afterwards i saw her in the court the judge said i must leave our house and if for two years i could cut the liquor out she d let me back and so i got a room about two blocks away where i could see the children as they passed along to school sometimes i d walk a little way with them but when i couldn t answer all their questions i d think i d better let em be and so i d only watch em from behind the blind well ma am i tried my best i made a calendar to mark the days i got a good promotion the time went by and all the while i thought two years are only seven hundred days and thirty over i can stick it out and then one day i ll dress myself up clean and meet the children and we ll go back home i d marked the calendar six hundred off and eighty six and forty four were left the heat came on and took the starch all out of everything i didn t care what happened i thought she didn t mean to keep her promise a week ago oh well you know the rest i don t know where i ve been i d like to die only i ve been so lonesome

ll tie our hands together to the iron so the waves won t the sisters we four live here together my three old sisters and i in a white cottage with flowers on each side of the path up to the door it is here we eat together at eight one and seven all the year round it is here we sew together on garments for the church sewing society here behind our fresh white dimity curtains that i ll soon have to do up and darn again it is this cottage we mean when we use the word home is it not here we lie down and sleep each night all near together we never meet my three old sisters and i we never look into each others eyes we never look into each others souls or if we do for a moment we quickly begin to talk about the jam how much sugar to put in and when we run away and hide like mice before the light we are afraid to look into each others souls so we keep on sewing sewing my three old sisters are old very old it is not such a great while since they were born yet they are old i think it is because they will not look and see i am not old but pretty soon i will be i was thinking of that when i went to him where he was waiting my sisters had been talking together all the long afternoon while i sat sewing and silent clacking clacking away while the lilac scent came in at the window and the branches beckoned and sighed this is what they said how did that paper come into our house fit to be burnt don t you think then the third it s a shameless sheet to print such a sensual thing the paper lay on the table there between my three sisters with my poem in it my little happy poem without any name i had been with him when i wrote it and i wanted him again the words arose in my heart clamouring for birth and there they were between my three sisters each read it in turn holding the paper far off with the tips of her fingers then they hustled it into the fire giving it an extra poke with the tongs a vicious poke then each sister settled back to her sewing with a satisfied air i looked at them and i wondered i looked at each one and i went to him that night where he was waiting my three old sisters are dying though they do not know it they are not dying serenely after life is over they are just getting dryer and dryer and sharper and sharper soon there will not be any more of them at all i am not like them i cannot be for i have a reason for living while they were picking their little pale odourless blossoms i gathered my great red flower and oh i am glad glad for now when the time comes i can die serenely i can die after living but first what is to come i am going to give my three old sisters a shock then what a rumpus there will be they will upbraid and reproach and then they will whisper to each other nodding slowly and sadly telling each other it is not theirs to judge so they will become kind and pitiful affirming that i am their sister and that they will stick by and see me through but underneath they will be touching me with the lifted tips of their fingers they would like to hustle me into the fire with an extra poke of the tongs perhaps i will pretend to hang my head perhaps i will to please them i am very obliging but in my heart i shall be laughing with a great laughter a great exaltation yes they will upbraid and reproach in grave and sisterly accents and mourn over me one who has fallen yet i suspect as each one goes to her cold little room deep in her breast she will envy with a terrible envy the child that is mine and the night the incredible night when the sun and the moon and the stars bent down and gave me their secrets reason doctor doctor i want you to come in doctor don t you hear me don t go by that s right come in here now and shut the door sit down there in that chair and listen don t sit there with that silly smile all over you i m going to make you listen you know when i first came they wanted me to talk i could see them trying with little tricks and questions well now i will i ll tell you if you ll let me out will you doctor

and he like that i cried soon as he saw me crying he went off and got a quilt and made a bed out in the sitting room he got up early so i didn t see him i thought all day and i kissed him when he came at supper time that night he seemed just like he was at first i mean when we were married first i thought he wouldn t do it ever again say doctor don t you tell but somebody came when i was out and fixed his food up so s he d want the stuff i know who it was but i won t tell not till i m out of here she did it out of spite i know i know doctor who is that hollerin make her stop i guess you d

hollerin for nobody got in her bed reeling drunk i couldn t help him coming i couldn t an i tried next day i went around and did the dishes up and cooked the dinner ready and all the time i thought supposing it s happened what ll the child be then what ll i have to bring into the world supposing it s happened perhaps it was nearly supper time i don t know clearly but i couldn t stay i couldn t i left a letter for him and went home i walked around the corner of the house and there they were sitting at supper father and grandfather and ma and little ben i stood and looked at them it seemed such a little while since i was sitting there not thinkin anything finally i went in and said i ve come home i ve come away from jim i mean don t everybody look at me like that i tell you i ve come home then ma got up and took me in her room and fixed the bed for me she said we d talk it over in the morning i stayed pretty near two months at home and all the while father and grandfather and even little ben were at me to go back father kept saying all he wanted was my happiness and then they got the clergyman and he talked just the same and then jim came they all were nice to him and jim was

they brought me here doctor i ve told you everything doctor let me out let me out let me out let me out her secret my secret and i stand here in front of the glass we are bedecking ourselves for an evening of gayety we look down and make our lips smile we look up and make ourselves laugh and then we turn and look into the glass again to see if others will believe that our eyes are smiling too how long will it last the evening it will be three hours at least maybe four there will be music and bright dresses and clinking and chattering and everybody will laugh there will be a great deal of laughter everybody will go about with smiling lips but if you stop and look you will see that everybody s eyes are hungry none of them shall know my secret no one knows that not any one in all the world there was one other knew but he is dead i heard that he was dead just now a little while ago just a few minutes ago by the clock i was putting on my beautiful dress when i heard a list read out from the paper many names a long long list i went on fastening my embroidered slippers while they read and read it came while i was buttoning my gloves my long gloves there are a number of buttons no one shall guess my secret there is a woman somewhere i do not know where she is but all her friends are hastening coming from all about to surround her with their melancholy faces soon they will get for her a black dress and a long black veil they will lead her faltering to a church her two wondering children held to her side one by each hand she will be very important they will say beautiful things about him beautiful sad things and all the time hid by her long black veil her eyes will be smiling smiling and what have i of him what shall i take with me to the party only the memory of that last dawn when i gave him all and bade him go a little girl i i see a little girl sitting bent over on a white stone door step in the street are other children running about the shadows of the waving trees flicker on their white dresses some one opens the door of the house and speaks to the child on the steps she looks up and asks an eager question the figure shakes her head and shuts the door the child covers up her face to hide her tears ii three children are playing in a garden two boys and an awe struck little girl they have plastered the summer house with clay making it an unlovely object a grown up person comes along the path the little girl runs to her and stops asking the same question where is my mother the grown up person does not make any answer she looks at the summer house and passes along the path the little girl goes slowly into the house and climbs the stairs iii the little girl is alone in the garden a white haired lady of whom she is afraid comes to find her and tell her a joyful thing the little girl runs to the nursery the young nurse is doing her hair in front of the glass the little girl sees how white her neck is and her uplifted arms tomorrow they will be gone they will not be here they are going to find her the young nurse turns and smiles and takes the little girl in her arms iv the little girl is travelling on a railway train everything rushes by very fast houses and children in front of them children who are just staying at home the train cannot go fast enough the little girl is saying over and over again my mother my onliest mother i am coming to you coming very fast v the little girl looks up at a great red building with a great doorway it opens and the little girl is led in looking all about her a lady in a white dress and white cap comes after a long time a man in a black coat comes in he says she is not well enough i am afraid the little girl is led away she always remembers the words the man in the black coat said vi the little girl is waiting in the big hallway in the house of the white haired lady at the end of the path she can see the summer house with its queer grey cover the hall clock ticks very slowly the hands must go all around again before the mother will come now it is night the little girl is lying in her bed there is a piano going somewhere downstairs she is telling herself a story and waiting soon she will come in at the door there will be a swift shaft of light across the floor and she will come in with a rustling sound she will lie down on the bed and the little girl will stroke her dress and crinkle it to make the sound again pretty soon the mother will step slowly and softly to the door and quietly turn the handle the little girl will speak and stop her asking something she has asked many times before my father but the mother has never anything to answer vii the mother and the little girl are sitting together sewing outside there is snow a woman with a big white apron comes to the door of the room and speaks the mother drops her work on the floor and runs down the stairs the little girl stands at the head of the stairs and cries out my father but no one hears they pass along the hall the little girl creeps down the stairs but the door is closed viii the little girl is held and rocked held so tightly it hurts her she moves herself free then quickly she puts her face up close and there is a taste of salt on her tongue ix in a bed in an upper chamber a bed with high curtains a woman sits bowed over her hair streams over her shoulders her arms are about two children the older one is trying to say comforting things the little girl wants to slip away there are so many people at the foot of the bed out of the window across the yellow river there are houses climbing up the hillside the little girl wonders if anything like this is happening in any of those houses x many children and grown up people are standing behind their chairs around a bright table waiting for the youngest child to say grace it is very troublesome for the youngest child to get the big words out properly the little girl interrupts and says the grace quickly the white haired lady of whom the little girl is afraid is angry the little girl breaks away and runs to the room of the bed with the high curtains she rushes in the room is empty she comes back to the table but she does not dare to ask the question she remembers the great red building with the great doorway xi the little girl is trying to read a fairy story there is nobody in the garden there is nobody in the house but the white haired lady someone comes to tell her her father is there she does not want to see him she is afraid xii the front door is open there is rain leaves are whirling about a carriage with two horses and a coachman high up holding a long whip stands waiting in front of the door the little girl is holding onto the banisters they take away her hands from the banisters and lead her to the carriage in front of the door someone gets in behind her the carriage door is shut the little girl draws herself to the far corner they drive away the little girl looks back out of the window xiii the little girl is in a strange house where there are young men called uncles who talk to her and laugh a large lady sits by the table and knits and smiles in her basket are different coloured balls of wool pretty colours but not enough to make a pattern there is a curly soft little black dog that hides under the table the uncles pull him out and he tries to hold onto the carpet with his claws the little girl laughs but at the sound she turns away and goes up to her room and shuts the door pretty soon the large lady comes to her and takes her on her lap and rocks and sings xiv the little girl has grown taller she is fair and sweet and ready for love but over her is a great fear as she remembers her mother s weeping the end end of the project gutenberg ebook flashlights updated editions will replace the
