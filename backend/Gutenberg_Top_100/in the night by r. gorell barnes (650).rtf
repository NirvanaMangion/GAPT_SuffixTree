of confusion xii out of the darkness xiii how it happened xiv sight at last to lt vivian morse foreword this tale of mystery must be regarded as a diversion from war a word which does not occur in its pages it was planned in a base hospital in france and written during recovery at home if it serves to interest for an hour or two those similarly placed and those still in the trenches its existence is amply justified it tries at any rate to deal fairly with its readers who are not called upon to admire clevernesses of deduction they are prevented from performing for themselves nothing is more irritating and more common in tales of the investigation of crime than to find such sentences as the great detective rose from his knees and put away his magnifying glass with a self satisfied air and not be told what he saw to make him self satisfied in the following pages therefore every essential fact is related as it is discovered and readers are as far as possible given the eyes of the investigators and equal opportunities with them of arriving at the truth r g b chapter i at the rose and crown the quiet of a fine summer evening was falling on the little village of salting the fields were slowly emptying as the dusk settled down and the bar of the rose and crown was steadily filling with the heavy footed silent minded labourers salting lies a mile or two away from a branch line which ends with apparent inconsequence at a sleepy town some ten miles further and the pursuits of its inhabitants and in consequence their conversation range eternally round the topics of the season and the crops and the simple but not necessarily good natured personalities concerning one another nor is it a social district in the sense in which so many english neighbourhoods are galvanized sporadically into an appearance of life by the moneyed activities of the upper classes there are no small gentry only farmers of varying prosperity there is only one large estate and though the great house which is hidden in the woods of it had been built for twenty five years or more it had never become in any sense part of the life of the place salting towers was the residence of sir roger penterton a man who cared nothing for the village which had happened to lie in the hollow below the hill selected as a suitable site for his house he was not interested in agricultural affairs he had chosen the locality solely because it was sufficiently convenient for the visits he continued to pay two and three times a week to the town in which he had pursued a highly successful career at the head of a big business hence an appearance in a birthday honour list and that accretion of dignity and pride which proclaims itself in the carriage of a knight he liked however to fancy himself as a landed proprietor even while holding that class in the greatest contempt as a set of idle and unthrifty folk the type of man of whom he was a shining example was as he often used to proclaim as he stood astride of the fire in hall or smoking room the real backbone of the country by years of hard work he had built up a fine business amassed a large fortune and incidentally married above himself he had succeeded and not by any stroke of luck but as he would declare by sheer industry and so could any one else he had no pity for failures show me a failure and i ll show you an idler was a favourite remark of his to those who tried to enlist his purse in aid of some charitable scheme as inspector humblethorne sat finishing his supper in the dingy coffee room of the rose and crown he could see the grandiloquent sweep of the drive as it crossed the park and disappeared into the wood which shut off the towers from the village and idly wondered where it led to he had never heard of sir roger penterton the warmth of the evening and the freshness of the air had their usual subtle effect upon him which the draining of a big glass of ale did nothing to dispel he felt mellowed sociable and well pleased with himself and heaved a big sigh to say so to all whom it might concern it concerned nobody that was the one objection to an otherwise entirely satisfactory state of things as he gazed out with dreamy eyes across the lane watching the cattle which showed dimly in the meadow beyond and listening to the slow ceaseless chatter of voices in the bar and the occasional sounds of the village he had a vague feeling in his mind that he was ripe for conversation he was not yet sufficiently accustomed to solitude to feel bored ease and inactivity were still delightful companions but nevertheless his mind did take hold for the first time of a certain indefinite feeling that he didn t know quite what he was going to do with himself in this self contained and seemingly lifeless spot in town whilst still shackled with work nothing had seemed to him more deliciously original than to bury himself for his holiday in a picturesque and unexciting village but it must be confessed that on this first evening a vague doubt as to the wisdom of this originality began to present itself to him there wasn t a soul to talk to and he felt talkative not to say witty in this last if is possible he may have been deceived for no one had yet associated wit with emmanuel humblethorne his colleagues in the force would have described him as a good little fellow painstaking and accurate rather than intuitive in his work and kind and helpful in his social relations he was universally popular even with those against whom his work was necessarily directed but not exactly celebrated for his wit he was of too sterling and quiet a strain to seem to incur that dangerous reputation nevertheless the fact remains on record that on this first free evening of his holiday he felt almost witty and had no one upon whom to exercise the unusual faculty he was about to feel in his pocket for his pipe and rise from the table with the idea of strolling out and seeking amusement for himself as it seemed obvious that none was coming to him of its own accord when sounds outside indicated the arrival of another visitor to the rose and crown but much to humblethorne s disappointment the newcomer when at length he entered the coffee room showed himself openly almost aggressively indisposed to be sociable he glanced at humblethorne in a swift and rather nervous way which was certainly not suggestive of geniality sat down at the furthest end of the table without a word and after glancing at his watch drew out a crumpled newspaper put his elbows on the table and resting his head upon his hands began to read humblethorne checked in the casual greeting which he was about to give filled his pipe with the studious regard of the completely idle man and let his eyes rest vacantly upon the stranger now that he was cheated of a companion the little curiosity he would have had was without reason but the mind is often above reason and after its bent has been given it by years of training and application will proceed quite happily on its own account humblethorne did not know he was taking in the stranger detail by detail but his mind in fact received a clear and reproducible impression of a tall thin man of about thirty three or thirty four years of age with hands which bore indistinct indications of refinement and clothes that bore none a few minutes later when the stranger s supper was brought in and he was compelled to give over his steady reading of the paper humblethorne also noted in the same uninterested way that he had a mouth of delicate sensibility unusual for a man of his apparent status and above it a pair of restless and perhaps anxious eyes these met his as the stranger after another glance at his watch began his supper and he gave a curt nod in forced recognition of the other s presence of which humblethorne took immediate advantage mind my lighting up he inquired affably as he struck a match not at all replied the stranger but without the least sociability a fine evening resumed humblethorne and looks like keeping fine for a bit the stranger took no notice whatever of this original conversationalism but humblethorne undaunted tried again know this part of the country at all the other mumbled an unwilling not very well stopping here long then persisted humblethorne what the devil s that to you answered the stranger suddenly looking up with surprising surliness nothing nothing at all replied humblethorne rising in high indignation except that if you are i m not after which he slammed the door violently behind him and felt slightly better jolly sort of philanthropist to run up against on a holiday grumbled the little man to himself as he left the inn and struck out down the lane what boors we english are now if that had been a frenchman we d have been bowing and parlevooing away like anything by this time damn the fellow he s quite put me out of temper he wandered on in an absent manner and his anger quickly cooled as he drew in the fresh sweet air of the july night and exchanged a pleasant good evening with a couple of labourers plodding by in the gloom by the time that he had found a convenient stile which seemed to invite a man to lean on it and look along the misty darkness of the valley his good humour was quite restored and he had even begun to blame himself what an infernal thing it is he mused to get into the habit of always asking questions it s bad enough when you re interested in the answers but hopeless when you aren t in the least i suppose it s too late though for me to alter that and it has certainly proved useful once or twice i doubt if i should ever have got onto the track in the scrawley case if it hadn t been for that chance conversation in the bus he was thinking as he often did of the one great case in his career when favoured by a singular piece of luck he had succeeded where a much more brilliant man had been totally at sea it had won him promotion and gained for him a temporary reputation subsequently to sink to a more solidly based but less elevated level and it was a harmless belief of his that he might have succeeded without it i suppose i resented his seeming to think i had a reason for my remarks just because i might have had he thought and drifted away into a reverie on the inconsequent perversity of human nature when at last he returned to the inn after a long silent communing with the stars which on this still clear night powdered the heavens with peculiar brilliance he found the landlord standing at the door and entered immediately into the easy conversation he had been so long denied a glorious night he said do you often have weather like this well it s middlin good here as a rule about this time o year replied the man with something of that rather sententious condescension with which inhabitants of a place so often speak of fine weather to a stranger as if suggesting that they have had some hand in it and should be regarded with gratitude accordingly you don t get much of this sort in lunnon likely he added and i s pose it s natural you should notice it powerful lot of rain we had last night though the other gennelman e s out somewhere too enjoying hisself i shall be locking im out if e don t come in soon who is he d you know asked humblethorne incuriously no sir traveller i should say leastways e ain t stayin here except just for the night as you might say well i m not sorry to hear it he s an unsociable sort of devil now i like a fellow who can talk a bit pretty place you have here ay it is that so i m told what s the best walk about here continued humblethorne not too far i m not much of a walker but i should like to see a bit of the country whilst i m here i couldn t rightly say answered the landlord slowly i don t hold for walkin myself and besides i ain t been here long no i thought you d have been born here lord no what made you think that sir i ve been here six months come michaelmas ad a place down melbury way before that that s where i was bred conversation flourished on similarly simple lines for some time and presently from the clock in the village church midnight boomed out slowly twelve o clock exclaimed the landlord time i was abed wunnerful how time goes when you get talkin if you ain t a comin in just yet sir will you have the kindness to lock this door and put out the lamp with pleasure replied humblethorne i shall just finish this pipe and then i shall be turning in too the continued absence of the stranger had passed out of mind and humblethorne had just knocked out the pipe he always declared was the best of the whole day and turned to obey the injunction of the landlord when he heard hurried steps in the lane and in another minute the surly stranger came into the little ring of light cast by the lamp he shot a keen glance of apparent resentment at the sight of humblethorne standing with one hand on the door brushed past him without a word passed through and closed the door quickly and with unnecessary force behind him quite the gentleman murmured humblethorne as he reopened it my gratitude for not being locked out is amazing now i should say he added thoughtfully as he lit his candle and put the light out that that young fellow was following a true instinct in taking a dislike to me but it s no concern of mine with which piece of philosophy he went to bed chapter ii philip and evelyn earlier on the same evening about six o clock to be more exact two young girls were playing an unequal set of tennis up at the towers they were nearly of an age between twenty three and twenty four but there was almost as much difference in their appearance as there certainly was in their play celia penterton was very pretty fair of complexion slender in figure and delicate both in feature and physique with a grace in every movement which was quite unavailing to impart accuracy to her strokes she was getting badly beaten by her friend evelyn temple who had a transparent vivacity and charm about her which owed nothing to beauty and was playing with an easy skill sufficient for victory without exertion she looked a picture of mental and bodily health as she stood on the court laughing full of attraction in the simple white dress which set off the glow of her cheeks and swung her racket gaily into the air to mark the end of the game play up celia she cried you aren t having a look in i know it s hopeless playing against you evie answered celia and i m worse than usual to day and besides i am so hot d you want to go on not much i can t give you a decent game oh that doesn t matter though you aren t exactly at your best i must say no i know as a matter of fact i ve rather a headache my dear why didn t you tell me exclaimed evelyn well it wasn t much and i thought perhaps a set would drive it away but it hasn t answered celia then we certainly won t go on the two came together at the net collecting the balls and evelyn looked at her friend with concern nothing the matter is there she asked no i don t think so replied celia doubtfully if i were you i think i should go and lie down for a bit before dinner said evelyn you haven t been quite up to the mark for the last day or two so obvious as all that inquired celia and it seemed as if the question was not asked in a wholly idle spirit not obvious to any eyes but mine darling replied evelyn at least i shouldn t think so anyway go and have a rest now you ll be catching cold otherwise it might be just as well agreed celia though i m all right you needn t be alarmed i m not only you are such a goose sometimes evelyn put her arm affectionately round her friend s waist as she spoke she was in reality a few months the younger of the two but in all the years of their friendship the leadership had been freely surrendered to her left to herself she sat down on the bench beside the court and flinging one arm carelessly over the back after a few moments took up the book which she had laid down before the game thus engaged she failed to see a young man come lifelessly along the path from round the back of the house he saw her however at once and pleasure showed openly in his face as he struck across the grass towards the bench his slightly drooping shoulders and rather pale cheeks made him look older than his real age which was just over thirty one his eyes showed bright and even penetrating behind his pince nez but had a tired look in them which his pleasure had momentarily displaced and his dark lounge suit neat but by no means new looked a little out of the picture evelyn did not hear him until he was quite close and then she looked suddenly up and smiled to see him well this is a bit of luck isn t it he said dropping naturally on to the other end of the bench and surveying her with an air which plainly showed that he meant what he said it entirely depends on what you call luck she answered lightly personally i was not complaining before it s a good book ever read it she held it up yes ages ago he answered that is not yet but i will if you like though i haven t a moment but hang it all i don t feel literary and i hope you don t where s celia gone in with a headache oh dear too bad on a day like this one of the most perfect we ve had this year isn t it and so useless until this very minute that is useless why you don t look over well yourself my friend now that i come to look at you i m quite well it isn t that evelyn well what is it then same old trouble only worse it was a bit thick that sir roger should have selected to day of all days to have what he calls a grand clear up yesterday when it was raining cats and dogs would have been better wouldn t it but i don t mind that after all he can do what work he likes when he likes and i m here for nothing else but what i do object to is his way of doing it the first thing he said to me for instance this morning when he got to his desk was now my lad i ll have you remember you re paid to work not loaf about and look pretty why the devil wasn t all this ready for me yesterday and in that nasty hard voice of his which always reminds me of the shutting of a despatch box i pointed out to him as quietly as i could i know that quiet way of yours interrupted evelyn it s rather irritating you know sometimes philip especially to a man like sir roger well i try not to make it so but i can t help the facts can i he had distinctly told me a couple of days ago to leave the thing over till to day and he was furious when i reminded him of what he d said it seems to me sometimes that he takes a perfect delight in petty tyranny oh i don t like to think that he used not to be so bad but he s getting worse and when he has a touch of gout he really is the very deuce as a matter of fact i don t really mind his manner except sometimes but just lately he has begun to hint at things what d you mean by things well he paused irresolutely and then continued he doubted my word the other day more than half suggested i was feathering my own nest at his expense cooked his accounts if you want to know and then when he found he was wrong and i was fool enough to think he d apologize not he all he said was that i d better be careful he d got his eye on me i tell you evelyn it s rotten he stared out gloomily across the lawn i m sure it is she answered with real sympathy tell me how s the book going that is always a great consoler isn t it it used to be he replied but i m stuck it began so well last summer didn t it yes i liked the first part very much well all i ve done since is heavy i feel it is and i m sure you d think so i haven t been able to get the necessary lightness and a tale of that sort is no good at all unless it s told charmingly however with a swift transition to brightness i don t care really about anything else as long as i m here that s the real trouble he frowned heavily again and went on with a return to gloom he s begun to intimate that he s only waiting for a chance to sack me philip yes i know and that i simply won t bear i ll see that he doesn t get a legitimate chance but if he makes one and he s quite capable of doing it well let him look out for himself that s all oh come what melodrama i can t believe he s the least likely to do anything of the sort i can easily well and if he did what would what could you do do repeated philip in a tone of sudden ferocity what wouldn t i do you re tired and you re talking wildly said evelyn quietly and you know it it wouldn t matter much would it if he did there are heaps of better openings for you wouldn t it asked philip scornfully you wouldn t care i suppose not a bit don t be absurd i should care very much if he sacked you as you call it but you might anticipate him if you really dislike working under him so if it becomes unbearable i mean and that would be quite different i sometimes believe you haven t a heart at all he retorted how would it be different i should have to go away from here just the same are you so fond of the place she asked the place good lord no he was taken aback by her literalness well then she continued i really can t see what you mean can t you people can be very dense sometimes this place means you and i ll put up with a lot more than i have done yet just to be with you you re very nice philip she answered with a change of tone only you don t mean half the flattering things you say why i m only here sometimes this place isn t my home it seems to be he replied i mean well i don t mean that as it sounds and anyway that s not the point it s the only place in which i ever see you or am ever likely to see you and before i let that old beast drive me from it i ll i ll don t you mustn t talk of him like that he s not as kind as he might be i know i know it a great deal better than you do philip for all your work with him there was a note of real sadness in her voice but after all he s my host and you re his secretary and we mustn t sit and abuse him here let s talk of something else very well he assented reluctantly only it s a great relief the man who invented swearing knew very well what he was about it has prevented a multitude of crimes but on your head be it what shall we talk about the beautiful sunshine or your irresistible charm you are too ridiculous for words sometimes she laughed if i thought you meant a word of what you say i should be very angry with you oh do he pleaded i ve seen you in many moods and i don t know one in which you re not more fascinating than any other girl i ever met but i ve never seen you angry and it must be worth watching it is she acknowledged from a distance and i said angry with you yes i admit the direction of the blow might make a difference i ve no doubt you can hit straight perhaps i don t know the only time i ve ever really been angry i don t count just flyings out and in again you know they re like the pebbles on the beach both for quantity and importance but really angry i didn t hit at all i couldn t it wouldn t have done the least bit of good only made things worse the lightness had dropped from her voice she was obviously speaking of something which touched her nearly still and his tone changed in sympathy when was that it was when john was driven away from home oh yes he murmured it has meant more to lady penterton and to celia than they will ever acknowledge and never to speak to him again oh it was odious you would hardly remember it she went on more quietly it must be nearly ten years ago i do he said it was soon after i came john and i were friends of a sort you know and as a matter of fact it was john who originally recommended me to sir roger was it you have never told me that well there was no reason why i should there wasn t much in it i mean it was my references rather than his recommendation which got me the place i suppose i didn t mention it because he s the forbidden subject d you know i shouldn t wonder if that isn t at the bottom of sir roger s treatment of me i never thought of it before it is possible she agreed thoughtfully but i don t know he s like that to everybody only yesterday i heard him using dreadful language to old fairlie called him a mid victorian fossil with epithets thrown in i won t repeat i wonder the old man stands it remarked philip he wouldn t not for a day if it was a case of sir roger alone but he ll live and die with lady penterton and celia yes he s a faithful old card he s a dear exclaimed evelyn warmly only he does require living up to it s too comic the way he shows his disapproval when celia and i are being frivolous i sometimes can t help shocking him just for the fun of it and he ought to know us by this time it seems to me remarked philip casually that we are straying from the subject i don t object to abusing sir roger as i think you know he s a poisonous now then well as i was saying he continued imperturbably i don t object to discussing you angry or otherwise but i do draw the line at discussing fairlie a very respectable subject yes that s just it respectability is the curse of conversation you re now in a pretty dilemma she said rising you don t object to discussing me but you do object to discussing a respectable subject thank you sir she made him a mock bow and started merrily for the house no don t go he pleaded please don t i ll be very good even that prospect cannot detain me she answered over her shoulder i shall be late for dinner as it is he watched her enter the house and then mechanically lit a cigarette damn he said forcibly i haven t said one single thing i meant to and i ve said a great many i didn t mean to at all chapter iii foul play humblethorne lay late in bed the following day wallowed in bed would perhaps be a more fitting description of the way in which he shamelessly and luxuriously stretched himself down between the sheets long after his usual time of rising it was due to no feeling of fatigue he had slept without stirring and as the occupant of the adjoining room could have testified if he had been disposed to do so with a sonorous simplicity it was due to laziness self indulgence unmitigated he had even gone to the lengths in order to enjoy his extra hour the more of getting out and pulling up the blind so that his eyes might rest comfortably on the sunny meadows outside and then getting back into bed again an act which as all true sluggards will bear witness denotes the lover of laziness for laziness s own sake he heard and vociferously answered the knock of the girl announcing morning and hot water but took no steps whatever to prevent the latter getting cold outside his door he was startled from a fugitive dream by the thump of his boots but again he made no movement to empty the passage if the truth must be told it was more than laziness which kept him in bed it was the truth dimly acknowledged that he had no idea what he was going to do with himself all day long somehow those meadows sun notwithstanding had an insipidity in his eyes which the vision of them a few days ago in town had certainly lacked then he had felt so sure that it admitted of no question that he had only to be among them with nothing to do to be absolutely happy already on realization of his vision he found it vaguely unsatisfying he was he perceived no country lark but a very ordinary london sparrow he was not already bored but he had a feeling that he very soon might be at any rate he saw no need to make the day needlessly long he couldn t sit indefinitely many hours alone in a meadow so it happened that when at last he came down to a perfectly cold breakfast he had forgetfully ordered it to be ready at and it had been within twenty minutes or so he found the table laid for one and no trace of the surly stranger of the previous evening that did not depress him and he rang happily for a fresh brew of tea rang two and three times but nobody took the least notice though he could hear a great deal of talking going on in the servants quarters it seemed so animated that he lacked the courage to go and make his wants known and after a long wait he sat down to his meal in no very good humour vowing that when next he chose to be lazy he would at any rate have his breakfast brought up to him he finished however all that was on the table and then lighting a pipe strolled out of the coffee room with placidity restored in the passage he met timmins the landlord who wore a very obvious air of great importance good morning said timmins in a sepulchral voice of pleasure in response to humblethorne s greeting dreadful news this morning isn t it what s that i have heard nothing replied humblethorne not heard bless my soul i thought as every one knew it by this time why coming closer and speaking slowly and deeply so as to extract the fullest amount of dramatic effect from a new listener he had had a good deal of practice that morning and was getting distinctly good at it sir roger was found dead on is own stairs right there in the all they say this very morning terrible wounds on his ed too seems as if they d really set on im proper don t it you don t say so exclaimed humblethorne timmins was disappointed the quiet little man had seemed such a splendid subject for the gratifying reception of gruesome details and yet he did not seem particularly impressed at least not in the way in which timmins had expected a thoughtful look came into his eyes and then they lit up with a gleam that timmins took for pleasure but was really professional interest ah said timmins i see you knew im well there ain t many as ll be sorry a hard hearted old grasper e was and no mistake but isn t it terrible so sudden like there ll be a sight of people over i m thinking it s lucky as i ordered in an extry large joint for to day bound to be busy ere with a thing like that appening but it s a kind of reflection on the place look at it ow you will don t you think no i didn t know him said humblethorne breaking abruptly into these remarks but of course i m interested i m an inspector of police though you ll help me by not letting on about that in the village you leave it to me sir said timmins importantly lord an inspector knew all about it before and i ll lay and came here on the quiet like no indeed i did not replied humblethorne warmly his sense of propriety was outraged at the expense of his sense of humour you leave it to me repeated timmins in suppressed tones of confidence i ll see as nobody twigs your little game i ll see you through i suppose there s a police station in the village said humblethorne ignoring the heavy suggestion of alliance yes sir just along to the left birts sergeant birts is your man shall i step round with you humblethorne declined the offer though timmins assured him more than once it would be no trouble not the least in the world busy as he was what with the expected custom and one thing and another but as humblethorne had a rooted objection on principle to giving offence to any one who might conceivably be useful to him or to any one else for that matter he contrived to avoid doing so by intimating that timmins would be of great assistance if he kept an eye upon any chance visitors to the inn he left timmins finally with an accession of importance which was terrifying to behold and made his way quietly along the village to the police station here an official card and a very few words sufficed to establish his identity and as the details of the great scrawley case had lingered on in the retentive minds of the country police long after it had been forgotten by their busier brethren he found it likely that even the sergeant would regard his appearance as a godsend he was able quickly to satisfy himself that it was at any rate a case of suspected violence and inwardly rejoicing at the dissipation of all his fears of boredom desired that a telegram should be sent to headquarters asking that he should be put in charge humblethorne had always firmly believed in refusing to speculate upon untrustworthy data gossip and second hand evidence were far more often misleading than helpful the mind was too apt to catch up and assimilate what it first received with the possible result that later and more important information attracted less attention than it deserved at least so he had found so he had deliberately abstained from questioning timmins and now having learned that sir roger penterton had indeed been found dead in a state suggesting foul play he asked no further questions of the eager subordinate sergeant birts was with the corpse he was informed and with no haste but equally no unnecessary delay humblethorne now bent his steps in the same direction from the social status and business importance of the dead man the case was bound to attract attention and the thinly populated locality suggested that the tracking of the criminal would not be a specially difficult matter humblethorne saw himself the speedy solver of an important crime and it was in high spirits that he passed up the drive which ran across the park and entered the woods at the point at which he had watched it the previous evening he emerged onto a large and beautifully kept garden which stretched on either side of the drive and another hundred yards brought him in front of the big modern mansion known as salting towers it looked as if the owner had originally demanded comfort of his architect and made no stipulation as to beauty beyond indeed the adornment of pretentious towers at either end it was a rambling irregular building with a large gravel space before the heavy door which was set nearly in the centre of the house on the right hand side clumps of rhododendrons abutting on the gravel shut off the drive as it went on to the back entrance on the left a large expanse of lawn stretched away broken up near the house by a few flower beds a gravel path cut the lawn round the house leaving only room for a strip of grass and for a narrow flower bed from which grew ivy of no great age and virginian creeper so much humblethorne noted whilst walking up a house not difficult of access he decided if as seemed likely the lawn and path ran on round to the left in front of the south aspect he rang the bell and waited after an interval he was just about to ring again when the door was suddenly opened by a large individual in sergeant s uniform who ran his eyes aggressively over the visitor and inquired what might you be wanting am i speaking to sergeant birts asked humblethorne pleasantly that s my name who are you i am inspector humblethorne possibly you have heard of me he handed over a card as he spoke which the sergeant took with no very good grace you re early on the field sir he said at length how on earth did you hear of the case so soon humblethorne looked at him closely a moment and allowed the dream he had pleased himself with spinning as he walked up to vanish i am staying at the rose and crown he said and so could hardly do otherwise than make it my business to assist you i inquired at the station and they told me you were here as i expected so i came up at once i need hardly say sergeant that i shall see you get full credit for any success which may attend our efforts i know so well what it means to a man to have an important case at last the sergeant s face brightened instantly it s very good of you to say so sir he said heartily to tell you the truth i m not sorry you re here he paused and then added with professional impressiveness it s a case sir of course i ve only had time to make a few preliminary inquiries but there isn t a clue of any sort in fact i think you ll admit it has some curious features but come in i never knew a case yet without a clue of some sort but whether there s one that leads to anything is another matter humblethorne replied as he stepped through the door and found himself in the large hall of the house he then stood without going further familiarizing his eyes with the surroundings according to his invariable rule that s where the body was found said the sergeant pointing half left to the foot of the broad staircase which ascended from the hall to a landing and then turned upward again to the first floor lying on the floor by the stairs there it was and isn t it now asked humblethorne sharply what s that under the sheet them s only the marks the body s in the smoking room first room on the left there who moved it exclaimed humblethorne with much severity did you yes sir at least birts grew rather red under humblethorne s eye and went on less confidently i allowed it to be moved after the doctor had seen it and i d had a careful look you allowed it to be moved what were you about well sir i d seen all there was to see and of course i had no idea you were coming you d seen all there was to see there was as much contempt in the little man s voice as he was capable of by nature good lord man how on earth could you you haven t had any special training why in the name of all that s holy didn t you wait if i hadn t come somebody else would probably have been sent from london as soon as they d heard of it there i m extremely sorry sir i see i was hasty but mr castle him as is secretary to sir roger asked me when i d finished looking if it couldn t be moved away from the staircase he said it was dreadful to have it lying there all day where every one had to pass to go upstairs of course it was broad daylight by then naturally ended birts red and apologetic i shouldn t have moved it if he hadn t asked me to well said humblethorne it s no use crying over spilt milk it s done now but never never move anything in a case of this kind everything may depend on it i should have thought you d have known as much even in the country who found the body he asked abruptly mr castle did about half past one this morning we can tell you exactly how it lay sir added birts eagerly and of course we took particular care not to touch the stains or anything come and look sir in a minute let me just get the geography of this place clear on the left first smoking room then drawing room is that it yes sir what s this room on our right dining room he stepped forward opened the door and looked in and satisfied himself that it was so and opposite the main door ah the billiard room where does this passage lead to pointing to one that led off to the right separating the dining room from the billiard room that goes through to the kitchen and leads off round to the left of sir roger s study and also mr castle s room and the body was found by mr castle about this morning lying in this hall to which five doors and a passage have access any explanation no sir absolutely none nobody that i ve seen so far heard anything or saw anything at all but of course i haven t had time yet for a proper inquiry very singular windows and doors all right eh no traces so far as i have discovered fairlie that s the butler assures me he locked up as usual last night and the maids say everything was all right this morning that looks bad who does the household consist of sir roger and her ladyship dreadfully upset she was at the news so i heard though he wasn t exactly what you d call a kind husband but i daresay she thought more of him than we did and it would be a shock to an old lady at the best of times she was always so particular too to have things just so then there s the daughter miss celia great friends she and i used to be when she was little she s all right then there s miss temple miss celia s friend but she isn t really an extra she s always staying here like sisters those two are and i ve known her ever since she was so high putting his hand on a level with his waist mr castle again has been secretary here for a great many years very clever he is and very easy to get on with too i must say he s high strung and finding the corpse upset him a bit but he s all right birts spoke grudgingly he regarded castle as the man who had got him into trouble then there s fairlie james fairlie and he again has been here well as long as i can remember and was with her ladyship s family so i believe before she married and is as decent an old fellow as you d see anywhere not much to go upon yet sir is there too early to give an opinion replied humblethorne cautiously i m not sure whether it helps or hinders most to know them all as you do it certainly saves a lot of questioning but then it prejudices a man also perhaps it does sir but then i know it isn t anything but waste of time to go suspecting some people miss celia for example why that girl sir just couldn t hurt a soul i don t believe she could if she was to die for it she s been delicate as you might call it for a long time for one thing and yet remarked humblethorne gravely if you recall the featherstone mystery there was a girl just as you describe gentle and popular a member of societies for doing charitable things and all that and she did have to die for it one thing is certain and that is that you can t ever be sure about human nature at least that s my experience many a criminal has concealed a cold blooded heart under a guise of benevolence and it doesn t do in our profession to forget it birts suspect everybody at first and don t allow your sympathies to put any possibility out of your calculations not of course he observed seeing polite incredulity in the sergeant s face that i have at present the least doubt of miss penterton s innocence all i mean is i shan t refuse facts if later they should point to her that s all and now who else lives here only servants besides those i ve mentioned none of them been here long except fairlie and the cook sir roger used to upset them a bit you know he was rough with his tongue when put out but there s nothing against any of them footman seems an ordinary sort of lad comes from southhurst that s nine miles away i can easily find out all about him whilst they had been talking humblethorne had been taking in the hall with a steady general scrutiny and now expressed himself ready for a more particular examination they moved accordingly to the spot at which the body had been found and birts carefully removed the sheet which had been covering it you ll hear the facts from mr castle yourself of course he said but sir roger was lying just here on his right side with his head here he indicated the marble just below the left hand bottom corner of the stairs when did you see it asked humblethorne gazing intently at the tell tale stains which spreading across the marble had soaked into the edge of the carpet a heavy silver cigarette box of indian workmanship adorned with richly embossed figures lay with cigarettes scattered round it just at the foot of the stairs and a little to the left side further to the left a couple of yards away beyond the stains lay a heavy stick about half past five this morning not till then humblethorne looked up quickly no i was only told of the crime at twenty past four alfred that s the footman came on a bicycle and the body was found about one a long interval birts much might happen in that time has anything besides the body been moved that you know of well sir some of these cigarettes were lying on the stairs i let mr castle move them he asked if he might and i didn t see no harm they were on the stairs so as to make it awkward to pass humblethorne silently invoked heaven so that birts added hastily they re all here though i counted them to make sure but you ll hear mr castle yourself i intend to and next time for the lord s sake don t move or let anyone move a thing it makes it hopeless humblethorne knelt down and examined everything especially the stick and cigarette box with the utmost care the box was lying close to where the dead man s head had rested the main bloodstain ran up to it and had darkly marked the centre of its lower edge nothing else was noticeable except that one of its corners had been dented and the brightness of the dent seemed to show that this had been recently done looks as if it had been used he remarked pointing this out that s the weapon all right returned birts confidently struck him on the forehead and made a nasty hole where did it come from d you know no but i expect fairlie ll be able to tell us whose is the stick that belonged to sir roger h m there seems to be plenty of blood about remarked humblethorne rising from his knees look here and here he pointed first to the left hand corner of the stone stairs and then to the centre of the carpet covering the second and fourth steps on each of which a faint but traceable oblong stain could be seen this said birts referring to the first is close to his head and he hit it falling there s a cut on the side to fit but i don t know what the others are footsteps birts footsteps many a man s been hung on less that s the ball of the foot of a person we want going upstairs or i m much mistaken or coming down it might be possibly but why should whoever it was come down with feet like that no going upstairs and either very careless or very agitated let me see the body they passed into the smoking room where a policeman was on duty beside the covered body of the late owner of the house humblethorne knelt down and removing the covering looked long at the clean shaven face of a man of about seventy five hard featured in life and inexpressibly repellant in the rigidity of death his eyes were wide open and seemed to stare out of the scowling face with a cold malignity the features were slightly distorted whether with fear anger or other emotion it was impossible to say on his left temple was a deep ugly triangular wound an inch in diameter and the congealed blood lay dark and sinister across his forehead on the right side of his head just above and in front of the ear was a short perpendicular cut made to judge by the slight flattening of the face on that side by some heavy object striking against it with considerable force or by a fall upon a sharp and unyielding substance he was in a smoking jacket and ordinary evening dress his watch and chain was in its place and there was a sovereign and some odd silver in his pockets doctor seen him inquired humblethorne rising at last from his examination and replacing the sheet yes sir arrived soon after me he said death had taken place some hours previously didn t like to be more definite either of the two wounds would be sufficient to cause death he said especially the one on the side of the head skull s fractured he gave it as his opinion that that was caused by striking the edge of the stairs in his fall probably agreed humblethorne well now i should like to hear what mr castle has to say and that i think i can do better in the hall chapter iv a mystery in the night humblethorne crossed to the fireplace and rang the bell which was answered in a few moments by the appearance of an old man whose quiet impassive respectability betrayed no hint either of the tragedy which overshadowed the house or of his own want of sleep he allowed himself to notice the presence of a stranger by an almost imperceptible lift of his eyebrows before turning to birts and saying did you ring sergeant is there anything you require this is inspector humblethorne fairlie answered the sergeant he wishes to see mr castle not in here in the hall mr castle is in the study i will acquaint him with your wishes said fairlie acknowledging the introduction by turning his body slightly towards humblethorne and preparing to go one moment interrupted humblethorne you re the butler aren t you i am you have been here a long time that is so i shall want to ask you a few questions after i have seen mr castle i shall be happy h only too happy to place myself at your disposal replied fairlie allowing a faint undercurrent of human interest to show for the first time through the dignity of his demeanour her ladyship and miss celia are upset naturally upset if i may say so at the terrible event in the house and i have had no orders but i am sure her ladyship would wish me to help you to the best of my abilities and to offer you every opportunity for arriving at the truth thank you answered humblethorne meekly and fairlie withdrew not quite the man you would expect sir roger to have had as butler remarked humblethorne altogether too old fashioned and superior yes he came with her ladyship he s a bit slow no doubt but he has a warm heart has old fairlie and many s the kind thing he s done for the people in the village now sir roger didn t care a rap of his fingers for the village he certainly does not seem to have been a popular figure popular him popular the sergeant gave a short laugh which in deference to the dead man beside him he tried to turn into a cough mr castle is in the hall said fairlie opening the door quietly the appearance of philip castle had not been improved by the tragic events of the night he was dressed in the same dark suit which he had worn the previous day but the neatness had gone from it his tie was badly tied and his collar was dirty he still wore evening socks and shoes and it looked as if his changing had been a hasty and casual affair his stoop as he walked restlessly up and down on the further side of the hall was accentuated and his pallor increased whilst his eyes though still clear and bright had a haggard as well as a tired look he glanced irritably at humblethorne as he approached and then seemed to look past him at the closing door with a nervous movement well he exclaimed i understand you want to ask me some more questions about this horrible business and here of all places i ve already told you what i know and i don t think you quite realize how unpleasant it is for me to talk about it murder is an unpleasant business replied humblethorne calmly it is the duty of every one to do what they can to help i know you must excuse a little irritation i ve been up all night humblethorne s eyes had travelled slowly over philip apparently seeing little and yet recording in his mind each detail and they now rested upon his shoes i am sure you have had a trying time mr castle he said i understand you are the dead man s private secretary yes and have been with him for some time nearly eleven years now mr castle is there any one as far as you know to whom his death at the present moment would be of advantage that s not a very easy question to answer replied castle with some hesitation sir roger had few friends and he had made in one way and another a great many enemies in the course of his life but none as far as i know who would be the least likely to resort to violence the answer must certainly be no did he go in fear of any one for example not in the least he was afraid of nothing and nobody in fact you had no apprehensions for him of any sort none i thought he would live to be a hundred that stick over there that belonged to him i understand yes he d been walking with it the last day or two in the house d you mean yes he had had twinges of gout he had it all last evening i was coming to that perhaps you will be good enough to tell me in your own words exactly what happened last night i came along the passage to go to bed one minute interposed humblethorne quickly that s the end i should like to know all that happened previous to that did you notice anything unusual in sir roger s manner for instance during the day no i can t say i did he was well brusque and touchy about trifles but that was entirely usual especially when he had gout he told me a couple of days ago he intended to have a grand clear up yesterday but there is no significance in that it was an expression he often used and only meant an extra hard day s work for me he came to his study as usual after breakfast and dictated a few business letters for me to write and also told me to have ready for him by the evening a detailed pr cis of a lot of new material he had had sent him at various times all relating to a branch he had thoughts of opening in liverpool he was in his study all the morning he was reading in the garden with his foot up i believe all the afternoon at least that s what he said at lunch he was going to do i was busy with the pr cis so i don t know for certain he signed his letters for the six o clock post and told me he had some more letters he would dictate after dinner so that they could go out at nine o clock this morning we all sat here while he smoked a cigar after dinner and he and i went to his study as near as i can remember just after ten o clock he sounds very busy for a man of his age partially retired remarked humblethorne thoughtfully was this an average day for him not quite he seldom worked after dinner and usually went to bed early but i ve known him do it when interested in any new development and on the whole it was a fairly ordinary day for a day here what do you mean by that he used to go to southampton two or three times a week as a matter of fact he was busy just now and even when he wasn t he liked to pretend that he was and make work is that clear perfectly please go on well we worked together for about an hour and a half he read the pr cis and even commended it that perhaps was the one unusual thing of the evening then he dictated his letters to me and left me to go to bed what time was that can you say at all precisely yes i think i can tell you exactly for i glanced at the clock as he left the room by that it was thirteen minutes to twelve and then i debated whether i should write the letters then or get up early to do them he would require them to be ready for signature when he came down to breakfast i decided to finish them there were a dozen or more to write and they took me over an hour to do i was not through till nearly half past one found i had run out of cigarettes and came along to get one here before going to bed what time was that as nearly as i can fix it about twenty five minutes past one i came along the passage by the passage you mean that passage behind you now asked humblethorne referring to the one leading between the dining room and billiard room it is important to have that quite clear castle nodded wearily that s the one he said my ordinary way from my room up to bed would be up the back stairs but as i say i wanted to get a cigarette and so i came along that passage feeling my way the lights had all been turned out sir roger had a passion for small economies but it was a bright night with a bit of a moon and there was a certain amount of light coming in from that small window on the landing castle paused and a look of vivid remembrance passed across his face he had been speaking quietly and evenly but now his voice rose and it was obvious that he was painfully agitated i had got almost to the stairs he went on before i noticed anything then i trod on something a cigarette i think and i looked down i saw something dark and round just in front of me at the foot of the stairs i couldn t think what it could be i bent over god shall i ever forget that hideous blood stained face he ended with a half hysterical cry and sank down into a chair white and shaking humblethorne upon whom the clearness and quietness of the earlier part of his narrative had made in spite of his first prejudice against the secretary a distinctly favourable impression watched him curiously for a moment and then said with sudden deliberate sharpness yes and what did you do then then repeated castle vaguely then i staggered back and it was all i could do to keep myself from screaming at the top of my voice it would probably have been the best thing you could have done sir remarked birts it was the last thing a gentleman should have done retorted castle angrily it would have terrified lady penterton and the ladies out of their wits to have been roused to such a dreadful sight suddenly like that let us hear what you did do repeated humblethorne with a gentle insistence which had its due effect i fumbled about until i got my hand on the switch went on castle shakily and turned the light on it wasn t quite as bad as it had been coming suddenly in that eerie light but it doesn t bear talking about i got down beside him somehow then but i didn t need to feel his heart to see that he was dead all right how exactly was he lying go to the place please and describe it as accurately as you can he was lying here said castle going with a very apparent distaste for his task to the foot of the stairs just to the left of the staircase his head on the floor here below the bottom stair almost touching the corner he was on his right side his knees were drawn up and both arms flung out in front of him his hands were open it was a natural attitude except for his head which was bent backwards in a way that seemed to me particularly hideous yes that s just how he was when i see him added birts in a rather aggrieved tone humblethorne remained silent watching castle as closely as the spot indicated yes he said that s all replied castle i don t think there is anything else i can add according to your account then there is an interval of an hour and thirty eight minutes from the time that sir roger left you to the time you came along the passage yes just about i cannot fix the exact minute i left my room were you writing in your room or in sir roger s in my room i took my notebook back into it as usual when he had finished dictating and during this time that you were writing you heard nothing not a sound of any sort but of course i was busy what did you do after turning the light on and satisfying yourself sir roger was dead by the way what made you conclude at once that he was dead the blood had already ceased flowing and his arm had begun to stiffen besides there was no mistaking the look on his face he must have been killed very soon after leaving me well go on please my first thought continued castle with an angry glance at the imperturbable figure of humblethorne was of course that he had met with an accident fallen and killed himself i mean come mr castle broke in birts that won t do i know that as well as you do birts retorted castle irritably but i m not accustomed like you are to meeting with such things as part of my ordinary life for an old man to fall and kill himself in his hall without rousing the house is not impossible the other seemed to be but i realized when i pulled myself together that there was something more than accident about him i tried the door it was locked i went as quickly as i could round the windows both here and in all the adjoining rooms making sure that i should find one forced but they were all fastened then i did not know what to do so i went and knocked up fairlie he was asleep of course but i made him get up and dress as quickly as he could and come into the hall after that i went and knocked at miss temple s door woke her up told her and left her to tell lady penterton and miss celia and came down here again when did you send for birts asked humblethorne oh i don t know returned castle wearily i was here trying to think it out it seemed so extraordinary and then fairlie suggested that i should try and telephone to birts and the doctor but i could get no answer whatever from the exchange though i tried ever so long so finally i scrawled a couple of notes and sent them off by alfred on a bicycle it was a m by the station clock when alfred reached me said birts yes i must have spent half an hour or more trying to get through and i don t suppose he hurried himself dressing and all that mr castle said humblethorne quietly on what terms were you yourself with sir roger on what terms repeated castle with a surprised stare what do you mean i was his private secretary yes i know that i mean were you on intimate terms or what sir roger was not on intimate terms with any one so far as i know answered castle with some confusion why do you ask it helps in a case of this kind to know everything replied humblethorne suavely well then yes in a sense i was that is to say i d been with him a long time and probably knew him better than any one else that is a mere evasion of my question said humblethorne softly well cried castle if you mean did i like him no emphatically no did any one birts will tell you what sort of a man he was if you don t know i didn t mean that i meant did he like you this is too much exclaimed castle i won t be cross examined in this way what are you driving at i may take it then said humblethorne quite unruffled that there were differences between you you may take it how you like replied castle with some heat differences of course there were differences if you think a man could live for eleven years without differences with sir roger penterton you re mistaken i quite understand mr castle humblethorne said in a more conciliatory tone you mustn t take offence at my questions i am bound to ask them you know questions yes but just one more and i think i have finished interposed humblethorne gently birts tells me you asked if the body couldn t be moved that s not a very usual request d you mind telling me why you made it certainly i felt that it was too ghastly an object to leave lying at the foot of the main staircase a moment longer than was necessary i hoped that the ladies would remain upstairs as in fact they did but they might want to come down any time later and i saw no reason after birts and the doctor had made their examinations why the risk should be run i couldn t have done it naturally without birts s permission as he gave it well wring what significance you can out of it after saying which castle looked straight at humblethorne and left the hall well said birts who did not at all like the trend of the conversation i have known mr castle for over ten years but i ve certainly never known him speak like that you probably have never known him in quite these circumstances remarked humblethorne drily ringing the bell no more i have exclaimed birts as if embracing a quite new idea ah fairlie said humblethorne when the butler quietly appeared there are one or two things i want to ask you just give me if you will your version of what took place that is easily done replied fairlie sir roger seemed quite as usual last night both at dinner and when i took him in the tray about twenty minutes past ten was he a heavy drinker heavy but not excessive replied fairlie solemnly i ve not often known him the worse for liquor but he was fond of wine still he wasn t a drinker between meals only now and again he would have a whisky or two if he was going to sit up he only wanted soda last night though because he was threatened with his gout i expect he was at work with mr castle when i went in and he did not ring or require anything again i locked up as usual saw that everything was all right and went to bed what time was that well let me see i locked up and put the lights out about a quarter to eleven i should say the ladies had all gone up then and sir roger used to go on at me for leaving lights burning when they weren t wanted so even if he did happen to be working late i didn t leave them on i waited up a little in case he should ring for anything and got to bed about twelve and you didn t hear a sound between locking up and going to bed fairlie thought for a moment no nothing he said i was doing the silver and i shouldn t have heard anything in the hall short of a revolver going off you are positive the fastenings of the doors and windows were all right they were when i went round we have a good deal of silver and one thing and another and it is not a duty i could leave to any one else he spoke with dignity and decision and then what was the next thing you heard i went to bed and had dropped off to sleep when mr castle burst into my room terribly agitated he was and it was some time before i could understand just what had happened it must have been about half past one he came to me are you sure of the time asked humblethorne slowly i wouldn t like to be positive it may have been a bit sooner or a bit later i didn t think to look at my watch until afterwards i just dressed as quickly as i could and came along and then i stayed in the hall with sir roger until mr castle came back after telling miss evelyn he sat here a bit with his head on his hand looking worn out then he began to walk up and down and i ventured to remind him it would be as well to telephone for dr shipstone not that he could do anything and for you birts but he couldn t get through and at last i sent alfred off that really ended the story of the night in response to further questions fairlie identified the cigarette box as the one which usually stood in the hall on a small table close to the drawing room door and corroborated castle s statement that the stick was the one with which sir roger had been walking the evidence of the other servants threw no fresh light whatever upon the death they had all gone to bed at their ordinary times and had heard and seen nothing unusual at all fairlie was able to substantiate the simple statement of alfred the only other man in the house by stating that he had heard him snoring horribly when he himself went to bed it was getting on for two o clock by this time and humblethorne expressed his intention of returning to the rose and crown for luncheon fairlie assured him that lady penterton would wish him to be offered the hospitality of the house but humblethorne declared that a walk would do him good he really wanted to be alone to arrange in his mind the facts which had been presented to him birts accompanied him in silence a little way down the drive it s beyond me said that worthy officer after they had gone a few yards man murdered in his own hall and not a single person know anything about it we have not yet completed the preliminary inquiry responded humblethorne and may still find some one who does but assuming what is most likely that the remaining members of the household why there s only her ladyship miss celia and miss temple left exclaimed birts in surprise exactly if as is most probable they were in bed and also know nothing about it we arrive at the conclusion that nobody does well he couldn t have dealt himself that wound on the forehead so either the assailant came from outside in which case there ll be some trace on window or door and it s up to us to find it or he came from inside in which case we ve listened to a good many lies this morning there is a third alternative humblethorne added slowly and that is that the murderer came from outside but was let in there might be no trace then but there would be somebody who knows a good deal more than he has any idea of telling us well it s a nice little problem birts don t get talking to anybody whatever you do and keep a sharp look out especially in the hall and don t let a thing more be moved till i come back i shan t be long very good sir answered birts submissively damn that man said humblethorne to himself as he walked on alone there may have been nothing to see there may have been a lot either seems equally probable but what a mug then apparently irrelevantly he added now i wonder what mr castle possesses in the way of shoe leather chapter v upstairs whilst humblethorne was thus pursuing his investigations in the hall with that unruffled air of patient determination which had threatened seriously to upset the equanimity of the overwrought secretary evelyn temple was upstairs in her friend s room sitting beside her whilst she slept celia had consented to stay in bed but it had taxed all evelyn s influence to achieve so much the news of her father s sudden and terrible end had worked on her goading her to aimless restlessness like a spur and seemed a far acuter sorrow than evelyn would have imagined had her imagination ever run into such a morbid channel as she sat holding her friend s hand without the comforting strength of which celia seemed unable to try to get the rest she so obviously needed evelyn went over in her mind the events of the night an insistent knocking had mingled itself with the staging of her dream until it drowned the dream altogether and she woke to hear some one knocking in actual fact on her door shaking it with irregular violence as she started up she heard philip castle s voice at least it sounded strangely unlike his and yet could belong to no one else telling her to open it she flung on a dressing gown and obeyed and found philip standing outside his face working with some strong emotion saying in a low uncertain tone i thought i should wake the whole house before i made you hear he s dead she was still so little awake that she could only stare in uncomprehending amazement and answer what are you saying sir roger he s dead in the hall he said jerkily sir roger dead impossible she gasped it s true philip it can t be her scepticism based on the complete inability of a girl whose experience has run along quiet channels to credit anything terrible as happening in her own life had a steadying effect upon him it is true he answered less tensely i almost stumbled across him as i was coming up to bed he is dead beyond possibility of doubt how horrible she exclaimed every nerve wrung what can have happened i don t know he has a horrible gash in his temple i don t understand did he fall i am afraid he has been murdered he answered slowly murdered the sinister word struck her like a blow and she recoiled in horror in this house how could he have been i don t know that will all have to be gone into later will you break it to celia i suppose i must and lady penterton must be told i will go and tell celia now and she must tell her mother yes but whatever you do don t let either of them come downstairs he was awful enough in life but now evelyn it s hideous she shuddered involuntarily then laid her hand on his arm you re unnerved philip she said what can i do to help shall i come down as soon as i ve told celia it won t be so bad for me he drew back almost fiercely you he cried how can you suggest such a thing stay with them you must i tell you i wouldn t have you see it for the world besides fairlie s there she looked at him a moment very well she said quietly i ll go to celia now and she had gone along to her friend s room which lay separated from her own only by a room that had once been a nursery and now was given over to the two girls as a study and workroom she tapped lightly on the door with a rhythm they were in the habit of using to each other and opened it but she had hardly entered before she was met by celia who seizing her arm with a quick half imploring gesture asked in tones almost of despair evelyn what is it how you startled me she had obviously leapt out of bed at the first sound of the tapping she was in her nightdress her hair was flowing loose in some disorder and her face looked particularly childlike and even piteous evelyn gathered the slight figure to her and said with the utmost gentleness darling you must be brave i know answered celia clinging to her i m a pitiful coward but i couldn t sleep and i i suppose i lay imagining things i think i think her hesitating uncertainty of speech made her seem more fragile than ever i perhaps was dreaming a little and then when i heard your rap it made me so frightened why have you come i thought you would be asleep ages ago you must be brave darling evelyn repeated drawing her down into the bed and sitting down beside her philip has just woken me to tell me some bad news bad news exclaimed celia half starting up what has happened evelyn tell me what has happened quickly tell me quickly sir roger began evelyn wondering whether it would not have been better to put off telling her until the morning as she was in such a state of nerves yes what has happened celia interposed in an agitated voice darling i don t know how best to tell you he s dead dead celia rose up drawing away from her friend s detaining arm her whole body stiffening yes i m afraid it s very terrible you had better know the worst philip found him with a wound on his forehead lying dead in the hall in the hall celia repeated after her staring down with wild eyes full of sick horror she swayed suddenly and evelyn only just caught her as she fainted evelyn lifted her into bed and used every effort to restore her to consciousness but it was some little time before she came to herself lie still ordered evelyn as soon as she opened her eyes again there is no need for you to move how did it happen asked celia in an agonized whisper it s horrible yes it is darling philip couldn t tell me any more than just that he had found him i don t know anything more now if you will lie still i will go and tell your mother doesn t she know not yet i thought you would go and break it to her oh i can t cried celia beginning to cry no i will just lie still i ll come back to you as soon as i can yes please i can t bear it alone evelyn had then bent and kissed her and gone along to lady penterton s room she knocked on the door and then opened it gently saying aunt eleanor she had invented this name years ago to express her affection for her friend s mother lady penterton s voice answered her sharply who s that what is it it s evelyn the girl answered soothingly evelyn what is it you can want what is it evelyn crossed to the bedside in the darkness and as gently as she could told the old lady who clutched her nervously her dismal news the effect was as she rather feared lady penterton never robust had been in feeble health for some time now she clung to evelyn with all her strength and gave way to dry gasping sobs which were terrible to listen to at one time she could hardly get her breath and evelyn became seriously alarmed but the paroxysm passed and gradually she became calmer and allowed evelyn to lay her back on her pillow she began to speak between tears which still shook her with their violence of things in her married life of years ago and of the time of her engagement for a long time evelyn sat beside her and endeavoured to soothe her but it was not until her maid who had now heard of the death came in that evelyn felt it possible to leave her she had then come back as she had promised to celia hoping that she would find her asleep and be able to get a little rest herself but celia was sitting up in her chair wide eyed white and restless and turned at once at her entrance saying oh evie how long you ve been i thought you had forgotten to come back only i did not hear you pass have you heard any more poor child answered evelyn tenderly why didn t you stay in bed i hoped you d be asleep i have only just left aunt eleanor she was dreadfully upset but she is a little better now and thompson is with her come to bed dear you won t do any one any good by staying up i couldn t lie still i tried answered celia does any one know how it happened i haven t heard anything more come let s try and rest together i m tired out her appeal on her own behalf had been immediately successful they had lain down together and succeeded in getting some much needed rest they had breakfasted upstairs and then evelyn had dressed promising to remain with celia if she stayed in bed as she sat beside her friend who seemed fragile indeed in the uneasy sleep of exhaustion evelyn s lively curiosity as to the mysterious tragedy which had so suddenly come into their midst was at work she had seen neither the body nor the hall but knew now the general circumstances the maid who attended her had naturally been brimming over with it and had told her volubly she had had it from mr birts himself that ow any one ad got in and murdered the master there in the all was an absolute riddle seein as there weren t nothing to show for it no window open none of the silver gorn nor nothink if that was really so if there was indeed nothing to show for it it could only have come from inside she did not think of humblethorne s third alternative namely possible co operation inside she saw the problem simply in its elemental possibilities if not from without then from within but there was no one there could be no one inside the house who could conceivably be guilty of such an act so far her thoughts had gone when like a leaping flash of light she remembered the way philip had talked the preceding evening a way she had at once denounced as melodramatic was it conceivable that any real meaning should then have been attached to it the apparent absence of motive beyond general dislike had been perplexing her as it was already perplexing humblethorne he only concluded rather vaguely that there must have been some grave cause of disagreement between sir roger and the secretary who acted so strangely and hoped to find something to justify the conclusion but she knew of a grave cause was it possible that last night sir roger had carried out the threat he had been holding over philip s head and given him his dismissal and if so what then had philip in sudden passion struck him down she remembered the unsettled way he had looked when he came to tell her his i am afraid he has been murdered beat in her brain her vivid imagination reconstructed the scene of the blow sir roger just as he turned to go upstairs to bed jerking out in his harshest way a definite dismissal philip s remonstrance leading to argument angry words and a blow she would have risen from the bed in agitation but for celia s hand within hers the vision she had conjured up seemed for a terrible moment suddenly real then as suddenly it seemed absurd she felt that philip might have struck a blow in a gust of anger but could never conceal that he had done so he would she was convinced have been overcome with remorse and would have confessed the whole story then and there to her her momentary doubt shrivelled as an unclean thing flung into a fire she hated herself that she had ever entertained it for a single instant philip was hasty and high strung at the moment he was also worn out but whatever he had done it went outside her knowledge of him her long trust and belief in him that he could be acting a part to save his own skin in this thought she understood his manner to a man of his temperament to come across such a sight unexpectedly he had almost stumbled across the body he had said would be sufficiently unnerving in unconscious reparation for what she now termed disloyalty her confidence grew all the stronger in so old and true a friend she stirred without knowing it as she dispelled her disquieting and ungenerous suggestion and celia at once awoke she still looked white and worn out and turned to evelyn with a heavy sigh and then lay still again how good of you to sit with me evie she said at last looking across the room in a tired way my dear what nonsense between us exclaimed evelyn warmly of course i m glad to do all i can but you mustn t take it so much to heart it is a dreadful thing i know horrible to think of but after all she paused and then added gently i know just what you are thinking celia s eyes turned upon her suddenly she did not speak but her hand tightened on evelyn s you mustn t blame yourself you re thinking i know went on evelyn answering her gaze that you found him cold even cruel in his lifetime and now that he has gone you wish you had loved him more celia s eyes dropped she looked away and said at last in a low irresolute tone no it isn t that it s just the awful suddenness i didn t love him i wouldn t tell any one else especially now but you know i didn t but it is dreadful to think that she broke off abruptly well you must try not to think about it any more than you can help that s so easy to say i know but try i can t help it said celia bursting suddenly into tears she controlled herself in a minute with an effort dried her eyes and then said you re quite right i m very silly i will try i think i ll get up and go and see mother now i haven t been to see her at all have i oh if it had been any way but this but i mustn t say that when she came back evelyn saw at once that she had overrated the strength of her new resolution and was on the point of giving way completely she did not speak but sank down into a chair and hid her face in her hands whilst her shoulders shook with weeping celia exclaimed evelyn with intentional sharpness this will not do it is almost ridiculous pull yourself together at once celia raised her face and the expression in her eyes as she looked at her friend reminded evelyn of a wounded hare don t speak to me like that evie she said piteously i can t bear it darling i m sorry but you must not go on like this replied evelyn you really really must show more courage what has upset you again nothing only being with mother was very trying she was very quiet but somehow very old and oh evie she wants me to send a telegram to john to come here at once there was a sudden sound of hopelessness in her voice well why not replied evelyn answering the unspoken disagreement there s no reason now why he shouldn t come here and of course he must be told at once you don t understand exclaimed celia breaking into an irritation unusual to her no i don t replied evelyn he s the only son and the mere fact that his father ordered him out of the house years ago is no reason why he shouldn t come to his mother and sister at such a time as this they ve never lost their love for him and never will cried celia vehemently but that s nothing to do with it we seem to be talking at cross purposes evelyn said in the most matter of fact voice she could manage she did not know what to make of celia in this new unpliant mood aunt eleanor wants him of course she does and i should have thought you would have wanted him just as much celia looked at her a moment without speaking a worried piteous look which went straight to evelyn s heart what is it celia she asked simply why don t you want him to come we have never talked about him i know we couldn t honourably after the promise sir roger made you and aunt eleanor give but i ve always thought he was the one person you loved better than me and aunt eleanor has never been the same since joyousness went out of her somehow when john left and yet now you don t want him sent for when he could be such a comfort to you both what is it won t you tell me celia had turned to the window whilst her friend was speaking her hands clasping and unclasping under an agitation she strained to subdue at last she spoke still looking away low and faltering evie he mustn t come he mustn t she turned and continued rapidly her eyes wandering over the room refusing to meet the other s troubled gaze her colour coming and going painfully you don t know about him mother and i have never mentioned his name she had given her word and would never break it she s like that you know but i m not i couldn t let him go out of our lives absolutely whatever i d promised and so i ve managed to get news of him and told her from time to time not by name but so that she could understand she never answered me i could see sometimes how she wanted to her longing was terrible but she wouldn t because she had promised she spoke in a rush of words as if to forestall criticism yes dear but surely that promise is ended now you see she thinks so she wants him now but he can t come he mustn t come cried celia passionately she s not able to stand another shock i ve let her suppose he was happy and doing very well so he was but he isn t now he s had a lot of trouble lately margaret and the child are ill and he s no work and is practically without a penny i should have to tell mother and it has been her one joy to believe him successful it would kill her i can t then i will answered evelyn firmly she ll want him all the more no you mustn t promise you won t i oughtn t to have told you celia spoke with intense agitation and seized her hand promise it s your secret not mine answered evelyn gravely but you will do a great wrong if you don t tell her a wrong to both of them she ought to know now and if he wants help it will be her happiness to give it him no no cried celia her voice breaking into wild sobs later perhaps not now oh you don t understand evelyn i m afraid so terribly afraid they ll rake up everything in father s life and when they find out about john they ll think he had a hand in it i know they will he mustn t he mustn t come here she had worked herself up into such a state that evelyn realized that it would be harmful to press what seemed to her so obvious she replied now to the last wild words darling you mustn t run away with such absurd ideas to think that any one could suppose just because john quarrelled with his father ages ago ten years ago isn t it that he it s too silly of you it isn t silly replied celia weeping i may be silly about some things but not oh i can t bear it you don t know john was she choked her words down sharply turned away and fought herself back to some control i will try and rest again a little now she said at last wearily don t you worry about me evelyn i shall be all right but evelyn was worried about her worried and puzzled more than she cared to own even to herself for the first time in her life she did not feel sure that she altogether understood celia chapter vi new lights humblethorne walked back to the rose and crown with a mind fully occupied the fields among which he had been looking forward to idling only to find that idleness of so rustic a character had no attractions for him existed no more than if he had been walking along the streets of a town he was absorbed in the problem he had stumbled on and almost entirely happy he would have been completely so if he had not retained even in a profession most unfavourable to the growth of sentiment a certain fresh idealism just because it was so obviously impossible he longed to be able to take people on trust it was to remind himself as much as to warn birts that he had dwelt on the need for general suspicion in the first stages of every inquiry he would have liked to be able on faith alone to narrow down the field of search and he was never completely happy as a man however absorbed he might become as an official when engaged upon a case of treachery or twisted motives straightforward violence he understood it was regrettable and must be punished but it did not offend him he envied birts for his simple faith especially as it seemed likely to be so little justified there were as he saw the case two main avenues of inquiry he had to satisfy himself first whether or no any one had made an entrance unassisted into the towers and secondly a subject that bore closely on the first how far the secretary was telling the truth the impression castle had made upon him as a personality was distinctly favourable the facts castle had related and admitted just the reverse the man was unmistakably a gentleman humblethorne decided by that much misused word meaning not merely a man of birth or wealth he was undoubtedly in a highly strung condition and too much emphasis should not be laid on his having asked that ass birts for leave to shift the body but it was at least suggestive of a desire to hide things it had to be borne in mind that a great deal rested at present on castle s word alone that even on his own showing there was an hour and a half during which sir roger had not been seen and that there had been an apparent forgetfulness to say the least of it in communicating with the police humblethorne putting aside his personal impression of castle felt convinced that there was a skilful mixture of truth and falsehood in the tale he had been told a clever juggling with the clock a concealment of some vital fact it would be his business to sift that truth out there was much yet to ascertain before he felt justified in arriving at any conclusion it was quite possible it was even he thought probable that he would find some tangible piece of evidence of which there was at present so little which would throw light suddenly upon some part of the story where falsehood was grafted on to truth talk talk he said to himself plenty of that and deuced few facts well we ll find them if they re there and if they re not well that will be a fact of the highest importance in itself he had forgotten the existence of timmins but timmins had not forgotten him he had no sooner put his foot inside the inn than timmins met him and exclaimed ah there you are sir i ardly expected to see you till the evening but there ain t much that s hid from you now i ll be bound this was intended as humblethorne was well aware as a question but he did not choose to gratify idle curiosity and he was very hungry so he only replied that he wanted some lunch and hoped that he would receive a little more attention than he had been favoured with at breakfast timmins was disappointed even pained and roared out commands to bring the gentleman his lunch immediately how much longer was he to be kept waiting his personal endeavours produced it in a time that ordinary frequenters of the inn would have considered astounding and he waited himself upon so august a guest humblethorne ate for some time in silence and timmins after trying in vain to draw him out even suggesting half a dozen people that he ad is suspicions of finally remarked with a sigh i see ow it is you ain t got all your ideas in order yet to want to talk i only wanted to elp as it might be there s a lot o sense in that old saying about two eds sometimes many a time my old woman as come to me and sed joe she sez humblethorne pushed his plate away it was obvious that timmins meant to talk he might as well be made to talk to some purpose timmins he said sir roger seems to have been a highly unpopular man ah you may well say that sir responded timmins heartily no true inhabitant of a village fails to enter with gusto into the demerits of a neighbour there won t be many as ll break their earts over im why was that i mean was there anything particular about him it seems to be more than general dislike well there was arf a dozen things the people ere had agin him but i reckon it was the way e treated is son that first let folks see is real character his son i didn t know he had one said humblethorne yes e has one it appened long before i came ere so it s all earsay as it were but by all accounts is son was as different from im well as er ladyship is that made for trouble i dessay e was for being a hartist i believe and sir roger e don t old with anything of that sort but i don t rightly know ow the actual quarrel came about the son e married a girl whose people used to live in the village i ve eard tell and sir roger e was that mad when e come to ear of it e turned im out of the ouse at night it was too with awful words and they say as ow e made er ladyship and miss celia she must ave been only a little girl then give im their solemn word they d never mention is son s name again i believe e d ave turned them out too if they adn t people as knew im they say e was worse as e grew older anyways there ain t one who could have lived with im as her ladyship s done not for all is money the things she s ad to put up with don t bear telling they say but there i don t old with gossip myself and i don t suppose e was as black as e s painted humblethorne listened with much attention anything which bore upon the life of the house might have its significance though he was too well versed in the exaggerations of popular report to do more than docket the main facts of the story in his mind and this was a long time ago you say it must be nigh on ten year i should say replied timmins after much thought mrs martin was talking about it only this morning and i remember she said as ow her eldest was just turned two when it happened and e s getting on for twelve now well i must be going out again said humblethorne rising you have certainly given me a good deal of information always glad to oblige replied timmins with an air of superb condescension humblethorne walked slowly back to the towers turning over the story in his mind but it was ancient history he reflected and however interesting for the side lights it threw upon sir roger s character and reputation it seemed to have no bearing upon the facts before him he was met at the door by birts who put on a look of importance immediately and obviously had something fresh to tell him well birts he said seeing that the other was anxious to be asked you look as if you had found out something i have replied birts with a pleased air i rather think it isn t going to be a real case after all what have you found there was a window forced last night after all answered birts it seemed as if there must be somewhere it s the small one in the pantry glass smashed and all let me see it nothing been touched i hope not a thing i give orders it wasn t to be till you d had a look humblethorne nodded his mind was running rapidly over possibilities they went together to the pantry which was empty birts leading the way with the expression of a showman about to exhibit his treasures he pointed to a small window about two feet high and one foot wide in the extreme right hand corner of the wall opposite the door which led into the dining room this was hinged like a door and had a catch on one side just below the centre and close to the handle a piece of glass large enough to admit a man s hand had been broken away the window was fastened and fragments of glass were lying on the sill and on the floor the sill itself had several long scratches on it at right angles to the window there you are said birts there s the whole thing some one after the silver there s not the smallest doubt it s kept in the dining room most of it in a safe in the sideboard sir roger hears some one in there as he goes to bed fellow had only just got in i should think sir roger comes in and gets one on the head he drops and the man bolts in a funk he could easily shut that window after him that s what happened sure as fate something of the kind may have happened certainly replied humblethorne thoughtfully only it doesn t explain why sir roger dropped on the far side of the hall or the extraordinary choice of a weapon n no answered birts that is awkward i don t know he said brightening the fellow got as far as the hall he saw that box all silver mind you and then sir roger came along the hall was dark continued birts warming to his work he stood still hoping to escape detection and sir roger didn t see him until he was almost across then of course the fellow hurled the box just because he had it in his hands it s not impossible that you are right birts it s certainly the simplest solution humblethorne examined the window again carefully whoever came in here he said at last was no fool he has taken very good care not to put his hands on the paint and it can t have been so easy to avoid he opened the window and leant out h m i see he remarked closing it again no fool indeed it is difficult to follow footprints on a much used gravel path he bent down and scrutinized the floor with the utmost care from the window to the door and then across the dining room and on into the hall nothing to help us he said at last you may be right birts i won t say you re not but i should like a little more evidence before i say you are any strangers noticed hanging about so far as i ve heard replied birts no one has been hanging round the place and no one was seen last night i ll make inquiries but of course it s a big place and it would be easy enough for any one to get into the park without being noticed yes answered humblethorne but they would have to know the habits and ways of the house when they got here just think birts supposing your theory s the right one of the risks the fellow ran why come then about midnight according to mr castle anyway before half past one the chances of running into some one were enormous think of it through the pantry and the dining room into the hall of all places it won t do not like that some one may have come there but if any one did it wasn t just a fellow after the silver at that moment he heard some one come into the dining room the door of which he had left open looking in he found fairlie putting away the silver which had come down from the luncheon trays fairlie he said i thought you told me particularly that every window and door was fastened all right last night and so they were when i went round repeated fairlie decidedly but as i told birts i only saw to the doors and the windows of the living rooms down here all except the study and mr castle s room that is of course it wasn t my place to see to them when they were used after dinner i shut that window in the pantry myself when i finished in there about nine o clock so i didn t look at it again when did you find it broken humblethorne asked turning to birts fairlie came and told me about it let me see about half an hour after you d gone replied birts how was it no one discovered it before on an ordinary morning fairlie replied of course either alfred or myself would have been bound to see it first thing in the morning but everything has been at sixes and sevens all day the maids don t go in there alfred he d been up and out on his bicycle and i let him off when he came back and i didn t have a minute to myself i did go into the pantry but just hastily and out again and didn t think to look at the window in the corner it wasn t till i d had my dinner that i came in and saw it and then of course i called birts s attention to it immediately i wish i had seen it last night added the old man then we would have had some chance before the fellow had gone far some one may have got in when the servants were all at supper remarked birts hopefully to humblethorne when they were alone again in the hall and hid himself till he thought the house was quiet he wouldn t know sir roger and mr castle were working late in the study he knew a good deal if he could dare to come in and hide himself in a place like this full of people was all humblethorne answered now i m going to take a look round he went along the passage intending to begin his survey of the ground floor in the study in which sir roger had last been seen alive whilst birts went out to interrogate the gardeners and look for traces of the man who he was convinced had come to burgle and been led on into murder philip castle was lying down in his bedroom and humblethorne found the time opportune for a thorough examination of both studies but was unable by any discovery to shake the story he had been told the pr cis lay on sir roger s desk with pencil notes scrawled here and there in another hand a dozen letters all dealing with various business matters and bearing the previous day s date lay beside it awaiting the signature they could never now receive as he had provided himself with the dead man s keys he was able to make an exhaustive search in all the drawers but he found nothing but documents and papers none of which helped him to build any theory whatever i am wasting my time here he said to himself at last with conviction if there was anything there isn t now i ll be better employed elsewhere he stepped out into the passage and seeing the little door into the garden standing open to the warm air turned that way a minute examination of the lock satisfied him it had not been tampered with and he passed outside on to a pleasant stone flagged loggia which ran along the west side of the house between the two projecting wings formed by the drawing room on the south and the study on the north several cane garden chairs were ranged irregularly along the wall and in one of these an old lady was sitting there was a dignity about her which not even the evidences of physical weakness and mental suffering could destroy an attraction in the delicate yet firm lines of her face which made it apparent that in youth she must have been really beautiful but even apart from the ravages which tragedy and sleeplessness had just impressed upon it it was a sad face worn with many lines she sat motionless white and almost haggard gazing without purpose across the brilliant day humblethorne coughed apologetically and she turned her head sharply with a nervous movement of her hands i beg your pardon my lady said humblethorne gently i had no wish to intrude i am the inspector in charge of the case she gazed at him for some moments without speaking her thoughts seemed to be far away and to be recalled with an effort yes she said at last vaguely what is it you want if your ladyship will excuse me said humblethorne anxious to make the most of the opportunity which had presented itself i should be glad if i might ask one or two questions she seemed to be utterly weary and hardly to hear ask me what you wish she said listlessly thank you my lady i only wanted to know whether you noticed anything unusual about your husband during the evening did he seem quite himself at dinner for instance quite not anxious by any chance my husband was never anxious i see and then after dinner he went to his study was that usual not usual but work sometimes made it necessary and you went upstairs i suppose i read for a while in my boudoir i did not go straight to bed can you tell me at all what time you went to bed my lady what time i don t know exactly i did not notice the time my maid could tell you oh no how i am forgetting i had lent her to miss penterton that evening as my daughter had gone up early with a headache and i was anxious about her she is not strong you know the old lady sighed heavily tremulously tears seemed not far away so i have been told answered humblethorne with sympathy he waited a moment and then asked you have said your husband was never anxious had he never any apprehensions i mean had he any enemies that you know of she shook her head slowly no she answered hesitatingly then she added in a low half broken voice as if wrestling with a truth it was useless to conceal i m afraid it is not quite true to say he had no enemies every very successful man has and perhaps in rising he made them but you understand yes my lady he assented her pathetic loyalty touched him he wished to go and leave her to her sorrow but one thing remained in his mind on which she could perhaps tell him more than any one and with a strong reluctance he said gently in a case of this sort my lady it helps to know everything or i wouldn t mention it i understood he had differences with his son colour sprang into her white cheeks and she clutched the arms of the chair her listless air vanished what has that to do with this she asked with a sudden fire of which she had seemed incapable he had every one knows that my son is coming i have had him sent for ask him if you want to know the wretched story go she added imperiously unless you have anything to ask i alone can answer i am not strong enough for the questions of idle curiosity every assistance will be given you she sank back in her chair exhausted and trembling and humblethorne with a slight flush of self reproach moved away and left her meanwhile during humblethorne s fruitless investigation of the two studies evelyn came down the main stairs to dissolve her uneasiness and drive away the headache which was threatening her by a little fresh air as she reached the landing and turned down the flight of stairs towards the hall she saw the sheet carefully covering the evidences of the crime and hesitated she had not been told the exact position in the hall where the body had been found and had not realized she would have to pass so close to it she half turned to retreat and go by the back stairs but the silence encouraged her and curiosity drove her on skirting the sheet carefully she gained the hall no one was about she saw the body was not there and stooping with a sudden impulse she lifted the sheet and looked down she noted with repulsion but also with interest as her gaze grew more intent the main bloodstains on the marble and edge of carpet and those both on the edge of the bottom stair and on the second and fourth steps they became photographed in her mind as any unusual sight will impress itself on a vivid brain she then looked with kindling imagination at the cigarette box and confusion of cigarettes if the box was thrown at him and one could hardly hold it to strike with it is funny it didn t drop further away and the cigarettes fly all over the place she thought forgetting in the interest of the amateur such scientific details as the possibility of finger marks she bent down and gingerly lifted the box taking care not to soil her fingers by touching the bloodstains on it she noticed the dent on the corner and saw rather to her surprise that there was no blood there as she bent down with a little exclamation of disgust to replace the box in the exact position in which she had found it she paused suddenly turned the box carefully over and saw that the bottom had from its edge to its centre an irregular blot like stain corresponding to that on the carpet as now shown by the lifting of the box the box was heavy and the impression of its shape was clearly visible on the soft carpet i don t quite understand this she said to herself putting the box back with great care if the box was there when the blood trickled down to it i should have thought it would have more or less dammed the trickle it must have been moved i suppose i wonder why she replaced the sheet and stood there puzzling over the little problem she believed she had discovered now that box belongs on this table she said going slowly to the small table which stood against the wall close to the drawing room door and it was there last night after dinner because i saw it i shall begin my investigations in the drawing room with a sense of slight amusement at the way she was following out a momentary impulse she opened the door and went in chapter vii fears and discoveries it was rather a crestfallen little man who re entered the house after leaving lady penterton the afternoon was passing and he had made no progress whatever more than that which was negative he reproached himself with a positive act of unnecessary brutality why had he asked her that question about sir roger and their son it was ten years ago and quite beside his inquiry he cursed timmins in his heart if he hadn t had the story forced on his mind that same afternoon he would never have wasted his time and put an old and tragedy burdened lady to further pain humblethorne resolved to devote the remainder of the day exclusively to an examination of the rooms and especially the windows of the ground floor he accordingly made his way to the dining room and began an unhurried methodical examination he worked intently and yet his whole mind was not on his task the firm yet sensitive mouth he had just been watching recalled to him some other mouth he had seen and he could not think whose mouths were a speciality with humblethorne a mouth was difficult to disguise even a beard and moustache could not hide its tendencies completely and nothing else hid them at all and the mouth betrayed more than any other feature much of his firm belief originated as men s beliefs will in a single successful instance of clever identification and it had not been weakened by later failures he was convinced he had seen a mouth of just the same character before when and where he was quite unable to recall it might be of no importance at all a mere coincidence it might on the other hand assist it annoyed him that he could not remember especially as in that elusive game the mind plays with every one it seemed just round the corner as it were of his memory he worked over the whole dining room with this dual mind but nothing rewarded his industry he went outside and satisfied himself from there that no one had either attempted to force his way in or as far as could be seen had entered through either window he then went along the outside of the house past the hall to the smoking room window examined this without result turned the corner to the south the garden side and was brought up short in front of the third window on that side which was the first of the two in the drawing room he saw a girl kneeling down and earnestly studying the soil in the narrow bed immediately below such a proceeding interested humblethorne to an amazing degree instantly desisting from his own search he moved along the edge of grass till he could see what was attracting her attention the soil had been obviously trampled the rain on the day preceding the murder had been heavy and the impress of a foot was clearly visible at the same instant that he noticed this evelyn perceived that she was not alone who are you and what are you doing he asked brusquely as she sprang up and turned in some confusion then she realized who he must be and the situation began to appeal to her i am miss temple she answered calmly who are you i am inspector humblethorne in charge of this case he replied and you have only answered the least important half of my question perhaps we are doing the same thing she said smiling and meeting his gaze with absolute frankness i happening to be just ahead of you that s all her complete self possession her frank and winning air could hardly have failed to impress the most naturally suspicious of men official and would be idealist conflicted in humblethorne as he looked at her and idealist won he found that without further proof of innocence he was acquitting this vivid girl at least from any connexion with the dark mystery he was engaged in trying to solve nevertheless he was slightly annoyed at her remark and answered quietly i think there are enough riddles already here will you please explain with pleasure replied evelyn the train of reasoning which brought me to this spot is simplicity itself a certain cigarette box is found lying close to well to the body that cigarette box belongs to a certain table it was on it last night and it is probable not certain of course but probable that whoever threw it picked it up from there that table stands close to the door of the drawing room interest curiosity if you like suggested to me that since that was so it was possible perhaps even probable that the intruder came from the drawing room a guess certainly but after all not a wild guess especially when one remembers that the drawing room opens onto this quiet stretch of lawn it would be so easy to get into the park and cross the lawn without being seen and then again the drawing room is the earliest room to be left unoccupied true it is next the smoking room but you cannot expect everything humblethorne listened with the greatest attention your reasoning he said as she stopped is admirably clear but what made you come here there seem to be boot marks on the sill inside she said simply though it is difficult to be sure without opening the shutters and i was afraid i might disturb something if i did that but they made me curious to see the earth outside so i came round and i find this she pointed to the trampled soil as she spoke do you often do this sort of thing he asked his eyes still on her she laughed i began five minutes ago she answered it was an impulse which struck me as i came downstairs to go out well he said i could do with a few of the same myself tell me he went on now i am here can you add anything of importance to what i have gathered about last night my own knowledge is nil she answered mr castle woke me about half past one i don t know exactly when but about then and told me well what had happened and i then told miss penterton and lady penterton i m afraid i m not much help there was nothing whatever out of the way during the evening no be conceded that isn t much help well he changed his tone and became brisk professional let s examine these marks he bent down and saw that beyond possibility of doubt some one had at any rate stood beneath that window the marks inside would speak as to the actual entrance he took out his pocket book and a measuring tape with a sense of relief this at any rate was plain sailing evelyn watched him with breathless interest as taking the greatest care not to disturb the earth which had grown hard and crumbling under the recent sun he measured and noted the one footprint which showed clear in the midst of the trampled soil i think he made that mark getting in she said see here s where he rested the other foot she pointed to a spot on the little ledge below the window where a slight newly made scratch showed on the brick and the bark of a tendril of ivy was badly bruised you have quick eyes miss temple remarked humblethorne appreciatively i have no doubt you are right by the marks he stood here some little time too waiting the moment he had spoken the last word he longed to recall it he stopped abruptly but it was too late she caught him up at once waiting she cried for what he did not answer and her eyes dilated and into them came a sudden chilling fear for whom she added in a low voice not as one asking a question but as a slow sinking of fact into her own brain let me see the inside he said rising and shooting a glance of keenest inquiry at her she did not seem at first to hear him interest had died in her she was turning away and all her vivacity had been struck from her face i have seen it she said in a dull voice i do not wish to see it again without another word she left him humblethorne stood looking after her moved less by interest than by sympathy she doesn t know who came in or she d never have pointed anything out he thought but she thinks she knows who helped him in when she was out of sight he went swiftly back and crossing the hall entered the drawing room he turned on all the lights and stood for one moment taking stock of the room generally and then slowly approached the window no marks were discernible on the carpet but a search revealed little pieces of dry earth on the stained wood carefully he unbarred the shutters taking great pains not to touch anything but the bottom of the bolt and the extreme rim of the shutters there was no longer uncertainty about the entrance pieces of earth lay on the sill only minute particles as if it had been hastily swept but the white paint was scored to the left of the centre with a number of tiny criss cross scratches and among them dirt was ground in some one s boot had been pressed and then turned upon it it was impossible to doubt it if confirmation were needed it was given by the damning evidence of the faint imprint of finger tips on the lintel where any one entering by the window would naturally have caught hold to steady himself as he gazed humblethorne let out his breath in a long ah suddenly with that agility of performance with which the mind sometimes chooses to delight those who have long been turning over a set of isolated facts without being able to fit them together he saw clear three facts came together without conscious effort and made a pattern the mouth of which lady penterton s had reminded him in vain was that of the unsociable stranger at the rose and crown he remembered it now perfectly and had no doubt whatever fact number one that stranger had gone out and returned hurriedly to the inn shortly after midnight on the night of the murder fact number two some one had made a secret entrance into the towers fact number three in a flash his mind had forged a complete chain of events the stranger was the son of whom he had been hearing he had returned home secretly for what purpose was at the moment immaterial he had encountered his father whether by arrangement or by accident a quarrel had ensued the son had struck his father down and fled and some one had first let him in and had afterwards closed the window and bolted the shutters behind him here the shutters did not help him no finger prints were discernible closing them again he sat down and ran over in his mind all the evidence in the light of what he now suspected with such deadly confidence it remained to track and identify the stranger of the inn perhaps a difficult but at any rate a straightforward task and to investigate further such questions as castle s property in shoes he rose up full of energy and certain of success went into the hall and rang the bell when fairlie presented himself he said in a casual manner oh fairlie do you know where mr castle is he was resting but i think i heard him come down a few minutes ago and go into his study do you wish to speak to him no it doesn t matter have you had any rest you must be pretty tired yourself i am all right thank you fairlie replied with a certain dignity it doesn t signify with me and i have the household to look after by the way remarked humblethorne idly you ve told me that all the windows were fastened were all the shutters barred as well i mean you are sure quite sure replied fairlie with a slight lift of his eyebrows it was my duty to see to that whoever came in knew better than to try any of those windows that s why he broke in through the pantry at least he added in a self depreciatory tone i don t know how people of that sort reckon things out but that seems sense to me yes perhaps murmured humblethorne absently what about being seen from the bedrooms upstairs though how do they go there isn t anybody sleeps on that side of the house now replied fairlie except mr castle and he s right at the corner over the study with the kitchens etc between him and the pantry window it s as safe a place to get in by as there could be i see well thanks sorry to trouble you it s no trouble returned fairlie simply i am glad to help though it s little i can do besides it will be her ladyship s wish that i should help in every way i can i shall be bringing tea up in a few minutes now i expect you would like a cup too will you have it here oh that s very kind yes here will do nicely said humblethorne anxious now he had learnt all he wished to know to get rid of fairlie and go upstairs without attracting attention fairlie departed and humblethorne as soon as he was alone went quickly upstairs and made his way to the room indicated as belonging to castle he listened outside a moment heard nothing and then quietly opened the door and stepped in a dirty evening shirt and evening socks lay on the chair beside the bed which was crumpled and a pair of evening shoes now lay thrown on the top of the rest below the dressing table castle had evidently completed his changing at last the shoes were those he had worn whilst he had told his story that morning humblethorne after one searching glance round walked across and picked them up and turned them over they were nearly new and the soles smooth and as clean as could be expected humblethorne had looked for nothing else they were not the pair he was certain castle had worn the previous evening he measured them swiftly and noted the measurements in his pocket book laid them down examined the soles of all the other boots and shoes just to leave nothing to chance and then swiftly but methodically searched the room he found nothing ten minutes satisfied him that no trace of what he was looking for was in that room he went first to one window and then to the other and came rapidly to the conclusion that a very brief search would reveal any package flung out of either and this man s no fool whatever he may seem he concluded no nothing so obvious as that but i ll find them yet he stepped out and on an impulse turned to the left instead of returning along the passage by which he had come and opened the door of the adjoining room he found himself in a small room neat and plain on the chest of drawers stood a little folding book case full of books a miscellaneous collection composed of a browning an anthology of verse a few small monographs on famous artists and half a dozen novels some moderate engravings of country subjects were on the walls and over the mantelpiece a couple of groups of school elevens boots and shoes were ranged tidily by the further wall the room produced an odd impression it was fresh and clean and yet had a curious atmosphere of emptiness humblethorne walked straight to the mantelpiece the groups were what interested him one look and he knew his chain of events was founded on no coincidence the boy under whom was written j penterton bore an unmistakable resemblance to the stranger of the inn humblethorne opened the browning on the fly leaf was written john from his loving mother a date twelve years old followed he went over to the other wall picked up a boot and compared its measurements with those he had entered in his notebook from the imprint below the drawing room window they were practically identical he had just replaced the boot and was gazing out of the window in a dark reverie when the door was pushed further open and evelyn looked in at him she had been returning wearily to her room and with new unreasoning reluctance to pass those sheeted stains again had come up the little back staircase which passed the door it was standing ajar and instantly attracted her attention for a moment no one spoke he was particularly vexed at her finding him in the room she was sick with apprehension at the thoughts which crowded in on her then in a low strained voice she said what are you doing here i am just looking round the house he answered evasively but here you can learn nothing here this seems to be the son s room if i m not mistaken he asked i understood he never came here it is ten years since he was here she answered then seeing his unspoken question she went on it was his mother s whim to keep the room exactly as it was when he was ordered out of the house he went you know just as he stood and left everything he was proud and angry i expect you have heard the story anyway his name was never allowed to be mentioned again sir roger had one great fault he was proud too but in a very different way and he could not forgive i see but i should have thought that this he paused and indicated the room oh he never asked about it why should he it was never mentioned just maintained sentimental yes but it harmed no one and pleased his mother but i am afraid she went on forcing herself to speak lightly that this old history sad as it has been is only a waste of time now tragedies of ten years ago have little bearing on tragedies of to day i am bound to look everywhere he said coming out they walked along the passage together in silence each was wondering how much the other knew she dared not say more in the light of her fears he did not wish to in the light of his knowledge evelyn went to her room and then after taking off her hat went with leaden feet to celia well she said as brightly as she could as she entered how are you feeling now it s lovely out not too hot like yesterday where did you go asked celia without interest oh only in the garden evelyn found a difficulty in keeping her voice quite natural and her eyes strayed restlessly to the window this was horrible what was it that had thrust itself between them she must make some effort to end the crushing uncertainty she had been suddenly called upon to face anything was better than that and in her heart she was convinced in spite of all the evidence which was pressing on her that a frank renewal of speech would dispel the spectre she might be deceived in her eyes and her reason but she felt she could not be deceived in the character of her own celia she looked up abruptly and said i m afraid the police are working rather at random it seemed to her though she hated to think it that celia did not receive this remark quite naturally she turned quickly and said with a strange note was it relief or disappointment or was it merely an overstrung imagination in the listener why do you say that well that inspector seems to be looking through the rooms just in case he can come across anything unusual i found him just now evelyn added as naturally as she could in john s little room she had hoped above all things that saying this would have little effect but her hopes were doomed to extinction celia started away grew as white as a sheet and said wildly in john s room i told him answered evelyn quickly i was afraid he was wasting his time it s horrible horrible moaned celia what could he find in there she seized evelyn s hand convulsively evie for god s sake tell me what did he say only that he was bound to go everywhere answered evelyn in a flat voice which sounded odd in her own ears celia did not remark it she sank back with a deep sigh shivered a little and then stayed white and silent evelyn could not bear it she will not tell me she thought and she has something to tell she rose wearily and said i m going to lie down a bit myself or i shall be the next one with a headache but it was her heart rather than her head that was aching and when she got to her room she could not force herself to rest chapter viii the broken window when humblethorne on leaving evelyn descended once more to the hall he found his tea set in readiness for him at the end opposite the stairs he felt that he had earned it and sat down in one of the big armchairs facing the fireplace well satisfied with his afternoon s work presently through the front door on his left birts entered and seeing him at once came to tell of his afternoon s activities the tale of the account he had given to a friendly reporter he did not think it necessary to repeat that had not had much to do with humblethorne but he had an entirely negative report of the inquiries he had been pursuing in the grounds to deliver there hasn t been a soul hanging round that any one admits to seeing was his conclusion and you didn t find any traces not a pair of shoes for example inquired humblethorne with a light half amused glance at him a pair of shoes repeated birts in surprise no i certainly haven t seen any that s a pity for i particularly want to find some give me their description said birts taking out his notebook humblethorne laughed i believe i could describe them fairly accurately he said but that won t help you to find them i ve looked in all the likely places already you mean remarked birts after he had considered this remark that they ve been hidden away hidden away or destroyed if they ve been destroyed that doesn t give us a chance i agree if they have been destroyed but shoes aren t easy things to destroy without leaving any traces especially in summer when there are no fires no depend upon it they have been hidden and well hidden the point is where just so remarked birts it s a large place and plenty of rabbit holes and the like in the woods when i was down at lunch where were you birts i was here all the time till fairlie came about that window and then here again after that any one come downstairs no sir well as you say it s a big place humblethorne relapsed into silence which remained unbroken for a few moments each man pursuing his own train of thought i was thinking if you agreed sir said birts at last of making inquiries in the village and neighbourhood this evening quite unnecessary and besides i want you here birts stared at him in deep astonishment and humblethorne allowed himself the gratification of watching him with a little smile i m afraid i don t understand said birts at length unnecessary does that mean you ve traced him and what can i do here i want you to stay here to night repeated humblethorne you have a man with the body too haven t you well i want one of you to remain on duty all the time and make sure that nobody leaves the house without your knowing all about it i may be quite wrong but i think there s some one in this house with a pair of shoes and a guilty conscience to dispose of and i don t want that done without our knowing all about it see birts struggled manfully to appear as if he saw but he was too full of curiosity to conceal it i see sir he said of course exactly what you want me to do but i can t say as i quite follow what you have in your mind when you say inquiries are unnecessary do you mean as you know who did it humblethorne paused it was a pleasant moment for him and he consciously prolonged it at last leaning back in his chair he answered the eager question yes i know he said i know in spite of what has been done since to prevent my knowing it only remains to put my hand on him oh astonishment at the beginning of the sentence mingled with disappointment at its conclusion but you know him birts went on who is he i ll find him for you all right i know every one about here all in good time replied humblethorne who was willing to gratify the sergeants curiosity to a certain extent but had received too evident a proof of his lack of ability to confide in him unduly at this stage if you want to know he s a youngish man clean shaven rather over six foot i should say thin has blue eyes and fairly dark brown hair a little grey above the ears it was not quite fair of humblethorne he was a poseur and he knew it he was ascribing to his own cleverness what was really due entirely to his luck but the astonished admiration of birts was an incitement he could not resist you re laughing at me sir exclaimed the sergeant you can t have found out all that this afternoon it beats reason and it isn t as if you lived in these parts and knew every one indeed i am not laughing at you birts protested humblethorne a little more warmly than he would have spoken if he had not been so nearly doing it that is a fairly exact description of the man who got into the house last night yes through that little window interpolated birts anxious to remind humblethorne that he had at any rate reasoned the crime out from that start what little window oh in the pantry i d forgotten about that no he didn t get in there not there why that has nothing whatever to do with the case i never really supposed it had interrupted humblethorne decisively that might have got broken in a score of ways there s not the smallest evidence that any one got in through it and there s every reason to suppose that no one did how did he get in then birts was nettled at this drastic sweeping away of his one theory and spoke with the air of a man putting an unanswerable conundrum through the drawing room replied humblethorne shortly through the drawing room repeated birts incredulously but the shutters were all up they hadn t been touched either for i looked at them myself when i got here it is possible to open them from inside remarked humblethorne gravely and that is the reason i am now looking for a pair of evening shoes if i can find them i know all i want to know about the man on whose story so much depends mr castle gasped birts you don t mean i mean nothing broke in humblethorne irritated that he had been led on to say so much and take care you say nothing yet to any one of what i ve been saying not to any one i ll keep my mouth shut all right sir never fear said birts with sudden sternness he recognized that in the eyes of his superior he had allowed himself to be made a fool of by one of the criminals and he was full of personal as well as professional resentment good i trust you remember said humblethorne rising or i wouldn t have told you so much until the chain of evidence was complete until it is by the way i think i ll take charge of the weapon i m afraid we shan t learn much from it though that kind of florid silver work is pretty hopeless for finger prints pity it isn t an ordinary smooth box if it was it could tell us all we most want to know he went over to the sheet lifted it and with great precautions not to interfere with any finger prints which might be discoverable on it removed and wrapped up the cigarette box now i m off birts he said remember what i told you they moved off towards the door birts saying grimly i don t think as i m likely to forget i may not be here to morrow morning added humblethorne in a lower tone i ve a few inquiries to put through and they may take a little time i can t bring to mind any one about here who exactly fits that description you give me remarked birts ruminatively let s see don t worry about it birts i know my man and i can trace him also i want to try and see if this cigarette box has anything to say well so long and keep your eyes open now as related at the end of the last chapter evelyn had found it impossible to rest torn as she was with the conviction she could not dispel that celia her own bosom friend held the key to the dark mystery overshadowing the house she had reached a pitch of weariness mental even more than physical when to keep still had become intolerable she tried to read but could not fix her thoughts on the page at last she left her room in despair and drawn by a hateful but irresistible magnet slowly descended the stairs towards the hall when she reached the landing and turned to come down the straight flight of stairs to the spot where the body had been found she saw the two men sitting with their backs to her engaged in conversation she stopped in some annoyance having no wish to keep on running across humblethorne and was about to retire as quietly as she had come when she heard his protest indeed i am not laughing at you birts that is a fairly exact description of the man who got into the house last night and birts s self conscious interpolation yes through that little window little window she thought why little humblethorne s rejoinder riveted her attention it was the first she had heard of the broken pantry window she stole down a couple of steps and heard every word of the remainder of their discussion it was with a sudden shock for which she was wholly unprepared that she heard the words the man on whose story so much depends after the momentary suspicion of philip castle of which she had been immediately ashamed she had entirely put him out of her head in connexion with the tragedy all her mind was centred on the strange manner and wild words of celia when she had discovered the marks on the drawing room window she had been acting on a mere impulse and concentrating simply on the one fact before her eyes had gone out to verify her discovery without reasoning beyond it humblethorne s incautious comment on the character of those marks had turned her reason onto the dreadful significance which lay behind the man who had left those footprints had been waiting to be let in there was no hope of doubting the conclusion in a flash her reason had been forced over her love to the truth john was celia had begun in her extraordinary agitation at the idea of sending for him now here and i let him in finished reason in spite of all evelyn could do to drive the thought away it had swept in overwhelmingly reinforced at the way celia received the news of humblethorne s visit to john s room so it was with a mixture of relief and indignation that she learnt that it was not celia but philip who lay under the dreadful suspicion that was ridiculous and it was unjust as humblethorne rose to his feet she slipped upstairs again recalled to the part of eavesdropper she was playing she was above and out of sight when the two men turned and went over to the sheet but heard humblethorne s remarks about the cigarette box and then his announcement of departure the possibility that it might be her finger marks which would be found on the box suddenly crossed her mind but more lasting was the memory of the original little puzzle which had started her on her career of investigation she had forgotten all about it in the turmoil of her emotions but now it came back to perplex her there was probably some very obvious solution but she resolved to ask philip at the first opportunity if he had moved the box though she dreaded with all her strength the terrible solution which her reason told her was the right one she continued to hope that something would be found wholly to falsify it this fact new to her of the broken pantry window might possibly help to establish faith in triumph over reason humblethorne s rather contemptuous dismissal of it did not promise well but still she felt she must find out about it for herself if only to divert her mind from facts which it was torture to contemplate she heard the hall door close as humblethorne took his departure and after a moment s hesitation came downstairs again birts was standing in the hall gloomily surveying the carpet he was not in a good humour his faith had been callously imposed upon he considered and he had the uncomfortable feeling that when all the facts came to the ears of his chief he would be lucky if he escaped merely with a reprimand he looked up sharply when he heard her tread then seeing who it was he allowed his official manner to relax a little he had known her these twenty years oh it s you miss evelyn is it he said take care as you come by miss nothing s to be moved not on no account no i see she answered skirting the wall scrupulously she looked keenly at birts when she was well in the hall and though she did not follow all his thoughts made a very shrewd guess at his general humour you look tired birts she said sympathetically it s the responsibility i suppose i hope fairlie s looking after you all right did he bring you any tea well miss replied birts gratified i haven t had any and that s a fact it isn t fairlie s fault i was out and come in too late the inspector had some all right oh but that s not fair why should he have his and you not i ll go and see about it at once don t trouble miss i ll ask fairlie for a cup when i see him it s no trouble every one has to do what they can to help at a time like this she smiled at him and went through the dining room to the pantry door glad to have so easily found an excuse for going there the door stood ajar and she pushed it open to find the footman alone in it humming a tune oh alfred she said get a cup of tea and some bread and butter for sergeant birts he s in the hall and has had nothing very good miss returned the lad hullo she went on with well sustained naturalness how did that little window get broken she crossed casually to look at it that s where the fellow got in who killed sir roger miss replied alfred with interest really that s very interesting she replied she examined the sill the glass the lintel and the litter on the floor with an attention she tried to make appear that of the purest curiosity the scratches on the sill interested her most what are these she asked them s is boots alfred answered ob nailed boots so birts ses i ain t much and at following such things meself nor i she answered slowly like humblethorne she could see no other marks suggestive of an entrance but unlike humblethorne that in itself seemed to her rather interesting in common with all but the best brains in his profession humblethorne had one characteristic which acted as a limitation he was able to preserve a completely open mind at the start of an inquiry but when he had collected sufficient facts to justify the deliberate adoption of a theory he was prone to treat as of little importance new facts which did not square with that theory in other words when once his thoughts had taken to running along a fixed channel facts were apt to get twisted instead of the channel being twisted or changed to include them he saw nothing to make probable birts s facile theory he knew a great deal to make it improbable when further search revealed clues which confirmed his theory in every respect and in addition he had the very definite identification of the stranger at the inn and john penterton the broken window became to him of trifling importance he had enough to go upon with assurance without it but to evelyn who embraced no theory and longed to be able to refute the conviction forced upon her it appeared in a different light the scratches humblethorne soon decided had not been made by a boot not even a hobnailed one and it was for boot marks that he was looking evelyn who was not looking for anything did not ignore them because to her too they seemed too regular to have been made by boots she did not understand them and continued to wonder what had caused them there seem to be a good many things i don t understand she thought to herself as having reminded alfred about the tea she returned to the hall but after all that is hardly to be wondered at i ve told them to bring you some tea birts she said and something to eat i expect you ll be glad of it thank you miss it s very kind of you by the way i see there s a window broken in the pantry she remarked casually you didn t touch nothing i hope exclaimed birts hastily i was careful not to she answered alfred told me it was where the the man got in last night so of course i didn t that s what i says said birts but the inspector he doesn t think it has anything he broke off remembering humblethorne s injunction well remarked evelyn lightly i ve no doubt he s very clever but all the same it seems a little curious to me doesn t it to you i must say as it does confessed birts when did you find it was broken she asked i should say it was a little after two o clock at least the inspector had been gone to lunch about half an hour two o clock this afternoon not till then but didn t you see it early this morning i thought all the doors and windows had been examined then a glance at birts s face gave her her answer he might have examined all the more obvious ways into the house but it was evident that there had been some gaps she added quickly no i expect you had plenty to see to in here what a horrible business it is just then alfred appeared with a tray and evelyn having learnt everything that birts was likely to tell her left him to enjoy his tea in peace she went slowly to her room turning over and over in her mind the new facts on which she had lighted some one might have got in by that window she wished her mind would think that some one had for he could have entered there unassisted but her mind did not think so and she could not force it to the scratches were too obvious somehow close on the heels of this thought came the conclusion some one had marked the sill in order to make it seem the place where the entrance was effected once more she was brought face to face with evidence from which her only wish was to find an escape this last was worst of all arguing a deliberate intention to mislead a desire to cover up the admittance and lay a false trail which could only have taken shape after the deed this went beyond all her former fears and chilled her to the bottom of her heart chapter ix evelyn and philip evelyn did not go downstairs again that evening nor did she make any attempt to see celia she sent word that she was worn out would just like some dinner brought her and did not wish otherwise to be disturbed she was very tired physically mentally she was strained and harassed whichever way her thoughts turned for some hours she tossed restlessly in the vain attempt to escape from them several times she made up her mind to have nothing further to do with investigations each time she had played detective her reason had demanded of her more than her heart could yield but she was in the grip of her mind it would not let her leave bad alone and always she continued to hope to try and force herself to believe that if she only had eyes to see it some other and less terrible solution lay before her already she had come upon two almost irreconcilable sets of facts it was possible that john had been let in that night by celia she remembered that celia had gone up early pleading headache and had said good night telling her not to come in again but it did not seem possible that after the tragedy celia could have let john out and then laid a false trail it asked for greater resolution and coolness than evelyn had ever seen celia show evelyn taxed her memory to recall exactly how celia had looked and spoken when she broke the news to her she had been it seemed looking back fearful apprehensive she had known something enough to be afraid not enough to know of what to be afraid yet john had been let out the window had been barred a false trail had been laid by whom evelyn s mind swung back in spite of her utmost resistance to the one other person who had admittedly been awake philip castle suddenly she felt the whole truth was laid before her celia had known that john was coming that night to see his father perhaps she had arranged it hoping against hope no doubt that sir roger would find it at last in his heart to forgive there had been a quarrel john had killed his father accidentally she was sure and philip it was philip who was doing all he could to screen him at last on this thought much less terrible than any yet she had found she fell asleep she awoke the next morning in a calmer and more decided frame of mind she was confident that she had hit upon the truth and was only anxious to have it confirmed one thought made her pause humblethorne knew of john and suspected philip his view of the affair corresponded rather closely with her own only he read it as murder and she did not how were they to prove that it was not the broken window clever as it was had not thrown humblethorne off the track but he had missed its true significance if he once grasped that it might be hard perhaps impossible to prove that there had been no intention in the death but there might be some fresh fact still to be discovered to help that proof evelyn smiled a little wearily at her many resolutions to have nothing more to do with investigation the spirit of it had caught hold of her there was one thing now she did not understand the first thing which had really set her feet towards discovery and that was the shape of the stain on the bottom of the cigarette box why had philip or perhaps john moved it for moved it had been she felt sure had one of them kicked it as they ran to sir john probably it would not help at all to know but it annoyed her it was the one thing still concealed from her as soon as she had had breakfast she got up dressed and went downstairs no one was in the hall but recognizing what an enormity she had committed in lifting the sheet and fingering the cigarette box she was specially careful to come down the further side of the stairs the sheet which usually lay more to the right was now a little in the way of her passing to steady herself more surely in stepping round she put her hand on the heavy wooden cornice which ran along the wall at approximately the same height as the balusters on the other side and as she stepped round and rather dragged her hand she ran a small splinter into her thumb she had gone several steps along the hall towards the passage when it suddenly struck her as odd that a polished cornice should have such a thing as a splinter she walked back and carefully examined the cornice level with the third step on the under side of the cornice she found that the wood had received a blow the projection of the cornice above kept it in shadow and on the mahogany it was hardly noticeable unless the eye was actually looking for it but direct examination revealed a dent about a third of an inch across and half an inch deep the edges where the polish was crushed were fresh something else i don t understand she muttered to herself now what in the world did that she spent several minutes examining cornice and wall both above and below for some distance on either side of the dent but found nothing and finally decided that there was nothing more to find probably that has nothing whatever to do with it and i am vexing my brains to no purpose she thought as she desisted from her examination and went along according to her original intention to the study here as she hoped she found philip castle who was engaged in going through and docketing the dead man s papers ready for the perusal of the family solicitor his face brightened when he saw who his visitor was and he rose from his chair with a cordial greeting why evelyn he exclaimed come in i don t feel as if i d seen you for a hundred years i ve come on business philip she said with some hesitation he looked now so different from the white excited man she had been recalling for so many troubled hours he had recovered his self possession and though still looking tired and a little shaken was apparently much as usual oh he said with a slight frown of surprise well come in and sit down won t you he placed the armchair for her as he spoke she shut the door and sat down now that she was here she found words difficult he saw that she was troubled and sat down himself gravely to hear what it was she wanted to tell him philip she said at last we ve known each other a long time yes indeed he assented warmly wondering what was coming is there is there anything about this horrible business you can tell me that you can t tell anybody else he started from his chair evelyn he exclaimed what do you mean his astonishment at her question sounded so genuine that she in her turn stared at him in blank surprise don t you know who did it she asked almost anxiously know who did it he repeated know who did it evelyn reproach bewilderment was in his voice you don t she cried what does such a question mean he asked looking at her in a strange way why should i know is it a way of saying you think i did it no no she answered i don t think you did it thank heaven for that but you think i know who did it she looked at him miserably i did think so she said in a low voice her theory the one theory to which after hours of restless unhappy doubt she could fit without too great pain the facts her reason had given her was crumbling in ruins he began to walk in extreme agitation up and down the room he was obviously cut to the heart by her thought she watched him and could think of nothing except that she had been wretchedly wrong as usual presently he stopped in front of her and said quite quietly evelyn as you said at first we have known each other a long time d you mind telling me why you thought i knew she felt herself placed by her own action in a dreadful dilemma she could not tell him the torment of doubt through which she had passed about celia and about him yet she recognized the justice of the question and the moderation with which he spoke you have a right to know philip she said at length don t imagine it was easy for me to think so i ve been suffering pretty acutely this last twenty four hours but partly by accident and partly by using my intelligence i have found out several things and the only conclusion i could come to a horrid one but less horrid than some i ve been fighting against was that you knew and were trying to screen somebody she saw his lips forming into a question and added hurriedly don t ask me whom philip please i may be wrong as i was about you it isn t anybody in the house it is difficult to understand he said slowly what can you have found out to make you conclude such a thing she longed to tell him everything but if he knew nothing and all her faith in him now was regained then she was back in her former doubt and she could not utter a word to bring celia s name into such a thing she might be utterly wrong she hoped with her whole heart she was but somebody knew somebody had opened the shutters and closed them again afterwards whatever faith she had in her friends she could not lay that irrefutable fact aside i wish i felt i could tell you she said as these thoughts swept over her i hate evasions but if it is not your secret and i know now it is not then well the less said about it the better till it s not guesswork but certainty you are very mysterious he said am i she answered wearily yes i m afraid i am and i am very worried it is all so dreadful i wish i could keep my mind quiet it will fly round and round and try against my will to solve what it does not understand i didn t expect you to doubt me evelyn he said following out his own thought with others it s different that ass birts for instance is eyeing me this morning as if i were a rattlesnake don t be angry with me she exclaimed i believe you absolutely if i did think you knew i was sure you were acting from a generous motive in pretending you didn t i thought some one must have come in and then there had been a quarrel and an accident and you wanted to save an unhappy man from consequences he never intended and you could not tell me because it didn t involve you alone that would have been like you wouldn t it well i don t know he said a little awkwardly it doesn t sound so bad put that way and that is the way i did put it she answered quickly i know you but philip these men don t and it is natural i suppose that they should think differently you have told them everything i suppose they have questioned me to their heart s content he replied what i mean is suppose they decide that you know even that you helped the other escape isn t there some way to prove conclusively that you didn t he changed colour a little good heavens evelyn he cried what a horrible question no there isn t i was quite alone i can only say i found him as i told them i can t prove it she became suddenly thoughtful no i see that she said but as long as there is nothing to seem to prove the contrary it doesn t matter what they think you didn t she asked the question hesitatingly move the cigarette box or anything did you he looked at her blankly as he exclaimed move the cigarette box evelyn what on earth have you in your mind why do you ask because it was moved and very soon after sir roger was killed how can you possibly know that he asked taken aback at the quiet assertion i have seen it since she answered a little confused and the marks on it make me think that it was put down on the blood after it had stopped flowing but before it dried what an extraordinary girl you are he said in a tone divided between admiration and amazement and that made you think i d moved it no i didn t touch it i touched nothing till birts and the doctor had come oh he cried his face lighting up as if a sudden light had broken in upon him i think i understand why birts is looking at me like that this morning after he d finished making his notes and all that i asked if i couldn t move the body into the smoking room it seemed so dreadful to have it lying there all day i was afraid you would come down and see it he was very doubtful but i persuaded him at last to let me and i expect that other fellow was annoyed he hadn t seen it where i found it and told birts he oughtn t to have allowed it and birts is working off his annoyance on me evelyn had listened intently but now spoke with impatience it was idiotic of you philip what did it matter if i did see it it had upset me he said simply coming on it suddenly in the dark and i couldn t bear the idea of your receiving the same sort of impression it is just like you she said you never think things out it was nice of you in a way but the act of a she stopped then added with conviction an innocent man no one else would have dared there is that about it tell me she went on with a change of manner i wish you would just what you told that inspector i haven t heard and i may think of something he at first wished to refuse but in response to her further request told again what he had already told humblethorne she listened all her mind absorbed trying in vain to see whether it threw any new light on the facts of which she was in possession when he finished she stayed silent a long while leaning forward in her chair her head on her hands one thing puzzles me besides that point about the box she said at last as much to herself as to him if it had been thrown as apparently it was and came open enough to let any cigarettes fall out why weren t they all over the place instead of all more or less together they were he replied there were some on the floor but most of them were on the stairs scattered about birts let me move them after he had counted them so as to clear a way upstairs scattered about on the stairs she repeated thoughtfully where oh all over the place he replied vaguely yes but where exactly on which stairs you must know philip i don t see that it matters he answered nor do i but i want to know well all over the stairs most of them four or five steps up some in the centre and some on the right as you go up that s why they were so in the way but really i can t see that it s of the least importance he spoke with a touch of impatience no probably it isn t well you re tired of being asked questions i can see that and i don t wonder i ll leave you in peace now don t worry about anything i ve said philip it s troubling me so and i m always wrong as she turned out of the study and passed the back staircase she remembered going up it the evening before and finding humblethorne in john s room she stopped after all she reflected she did not know it was john who entered by the drawing room window she only suspected it because of celia now that her thoughts about the one were in such confusion she might be wrong about the other she believed she was right but she could turn belief into certainty she slipped upstairs entered john s room took a boot belonging to a left foot since that she remembered was the clear impression and went quietly downstairs and out of doors no one was about she went straight to the first drawing room window stooped down and as lightly as possible so as not to break away the edges placed the boot over the impression with a heavy heart she saw that it confirmed her fears she could doubt no longer that john had been there on the evening of the tragedy had waited to be let in an obviously arranged meeting and had been let out secretly it could not be by philip after what he had said if it was by celia then she had indeed little knowledge of her friend it was a sorely puzzled investigator who went slowly wearily back into the house and replaced the boot which she had prayed would give her thoughts the lie chapter x the little dancing girl evelyn stood for many minutes after replacing the boot in doubt and distress she absolved philip she could neither absolve celia nor understand how it was possible that she had had the resolution to do what undeniably had been done there was something else there must be which would explain all perhaps if she could find the reason for the two things which still seemed to have none the moving of the box and the dent in the wall she would understand everything at any rate she could make no discovery which rendered things less horrible than they had now again become so thinking she came down once more to the hall took up a position on the further side opposite the foot of the stairs and tried with an intense effort of mind to imagine stage by stage exactly what had taken place it was fruitless she was unable to pass beyond the conclusions to which she had already been forced at last rather hopeless of progress fearful that no progress was possible and that incredible as it seemed to her the truth lay between celia and john as she had first been appalled by it on realizing the significance of the barred shutters she came slowly forward to the edge of the sheet she did not dare move it again but she had no need to she saw the stains and all below it in her mind as clearly as in a photograph she was thinking whether any enlightenment was to be found in the original positions of the cigarettes most of them four or five steps up she thought in the centre and right her heart gave a sudden leap light burst in her brain and thoughts followed one upon the other that was just beyond the dent the dent was made by the box the cigarettes had naturally fallen scattered most of them just beyond where it struck she ran up the first and second steps stooped at the third looked at the dent again and was certain of her conclusion then she turned round and faced the hall from there her eyes travelled automatically to the little table on which the cigarette box ordinarily stood instantly she saw that the cigarettes had fallen on the centre and right because the box came obliquely from the left clearing the end of the balusters and striking against the wall the thought rose sharp and bewildering the box had missed but it had been found lying at the foot of the stairs close to the dead man s head and stained with his blood the one thing remaining which had puzzled her was suddenly illuminated with light it was no accident but murder and the murderer was the man who had moved the box he had set it down in the dead man s blood deliberately to make it appear the weapon and it had never touched him at all relief and dread fought a bitter battle in her for the first time since he had come into her thoughts to overshadow them with fear she felt it possible to acquit john not only of murder but of causing his father s death at all the thought of him had been bound up with the box and now she knew the box had shed no blood but the instant she had yielded herself up to the relief of this her reason became weighed with a greater sense of evil still the box had missed but none the less sir roger had been struck down in spite of all her reborn belief she could not repress the thought that this might have been by the hand either of john or of philip philip and john might both have attacked sir roger more odious still philip might have killed him after john had left believing that it would not be difficult to shift the guilt onto one who had secretly entered the house he was forbidden she felt sick as these possibilities forced their way in on her no longer could she even comfort herself by believing in the thought of accident and after the deed was done what then if they had acted together philip had let john out and broken the little window then back at the body he had had a spasm of fear and put the box where it had been found that at least would throw suspicion away from him if he had done it after he had let john out striking perhaps on an impulse without thinking it out in all its traces afterwards the moving of the box argued just the same a fell and deadly motive then he had gone back to his study she saw the whole thing written those letters rapidly and then returned to make a show of finding the body and to act a long drawn lie wildly she wracked her brain for one detail which could disprove these fearful imaginings a pair of evening shoes the words she had heard humblethorne use in his talk with birts the previous evening words then without special significance came instead with swift insistence into her mind they wanted a pair of philip s shoes she had heard them say so why instantly thought answered itself as she remembered the rest of the stains so close to her she stooped and lifting the edge of the sheet looked again at the two faint oblong stains one on the second and one on the fourth step he went upstairs after the murder came the flashing conclusion to act his lie first to me she added with a horror stricken repulsion so violent was this that she struggled with all her might against it this seemed to her the most shocking part of the whole dreadful business to me with wet blood on his shoes impossible he must have had some other reason it must have been before that she found herself saying she dropped the sheet she had been clutching with unconscious fierceness and white and cold with her mouth set in a fierce hard line examined the stairs above and then the landing and then the second flight of stairs when she reached the top without having found anything to answer her she stopped she would not believe her first thought while any other solution could be found she leant against the balustrade and looked down into the hall suddenly it crossed her mind that it was possible that sir roger might have been struck from there she wondered why it had not occurred to her before and then realized that as long as it was assumed that the cigarette box had killed him any such possibility was far too remote but now when another weapon was in question the situation was different as she stood though just at the head of the stairs she saw that sir roger would have had his back towards her if he had been turned towards the hall and he had been she was sure for if he had been coming up the stairs and the body moved there must have been some indications and there were none she accordingly went along a few steps until she reached a bracket which stood against and level with the top of the balusters and could see most of the hall here she was almost directly above the spot at which the body had been found and she stood still her thoughts concentrated on the one problem directly before her mind why had philip come upstairs immediately after the murder she gazed out over the hall and tried to find a reason her eyes travelled slowly over all she could see from the doors of the hall and the dining room across the hall to the tragic place almost immediately below her no thought no reason came to her she leant forward to discover how far underneath her towards the drawing room door she could see and found that it was invisible she was turning away with a gesture of impatience when her glance fell on a little bronze statuette of a dancing girl about nine inches high and fixed into a small ebony pedestal which stood on the bracket level with the top of the balusters it had stood there for years and she had passed it a thousand times but there was something about its pose now which instantly attracted her attention keyed as that was to the uttermost the right arm which ordinarily was raised with the elbow bent at right angles to the body and the forearm curving in an easy graceful manner outwards was now bent forwards and rather across the body in a way that huddled the shoulder awkwardly evelyn gripped the rail of the balusters with both hands with a sudden violence of which she was completely unconscious and then her heart beating wildly with an intuition of success bent to examine what she had found on the elbow a little underneath and behind it so that unless the statuette was moved and she had no intention of touching it then it could only be seen by twisting well over the balusters was a little dirty dark red clot the whole of the arm at the back from elbow to shoulder and again a little down the side was slightly stained as well evelyn knew that she had come upon not only the answer to the puzzle which had then been engaging her but the true weapon as well the statuette stood almost directly above the spot where sir roger s body had been found she saw it all now it had been so easy to fling it down upon the victim standing below sir roger s attention must have been attracted by a noise above just too late he had started back and the statuette had struck him on his uplifted forehead and dashed him to the ground it was obvious too why the murderer had come upstairs immediately after committing the crime it was to replace the statuette what part john had played she could not tell it was evident that he could have had no direct hand in it he would never have come there to seize and hurl so bizarre a weapon black as the tragedy seemed evelyn was sensible of two consoling thoughts john might know but it might have happened after he had gone probably it had at any rate he had not struck the blow and secondly celia whatever she knew and feared had not known of this had not helped to cover up the tracks of her father s murderer she drew back a little from the bracket clutching these two thoughts to her bitter sickened heart and then stooping down gazed fixedly at the floor for any further direct testimony as to the replacing of the statuette nothing was visible on the carpet but outlined on the white paint between the carpet and the balusters was the imprint of a left foot very faint but clear enough of outline to intently searching eyes it needed no great acuteness to deduce that in the act of putting the statuette back on the bracket the murderer had stepped off the carpet with one foot for many minutes after making this discovery evelyn remained staring at the ominous mark then she turned and went straight to her room she felt appalled terrified at the abysses of human nature into which she had unwittingly forced her way once again she wished with all her heart that she had never been curious enough to try and penetrate the mystery she had been drawn on from one darkness to another and yet she had not been able to leave it alone nor could she now she was impelled against her desire to turn conviction into undeniable certainty remembering that the first thing humblethorne had done on coming on the footmarks outside the drawing room window had been to secure the measurements she took a pair of scissors and a piece of drawer paper and returning to the mark below the statuette carefully cut out a pattern then she went back to her room what her purpose was she hardly knew she did not know what she would do when she had established conviction on an unbreakable chain of reason but while any possibility of error remained her bitterness of spirit gave her no rest she looked at the cutting in her hand and shivered at the significance which so simple a thing contained then she wondered if she dared go immediately to compare it with its original but she did not know for certain that philip was still in the study and she saw no way of finding out without revealing the horror in her soul she stood turning the pattern over and over purposelessly then she thrust it into a drawer as if it burnt her she would go and get a measuring tape anything to feed her craving for action with this intention she went into the room she shared with celia and was rummaging in a work basket when her friend came in why evelyn said celia i didn t know where you were you have neglected me this morning have i dear replied evelyn in so vague a tone that it was obvious that the remark had not penetrated in the least what s the matter aren t you feeling any better asked celia with sympathetic surprise she was not used to such replies what s that better oh i m all right said evelyn trying to force her thoughts away and speak naturally she put the work basket down closed it and then looked across at celia and how are you this morning she added you seem a little more rested but why that worried look oh evie it s about well what we spoke of yesterday responded celia half eagerly from desire to share and half fearfully from memory of their difference of view about well john you know her voice in saying the name quivered and stumbled yes asked evelyn with a quick glance i ve just been with mother and she began by asking me if i had had any answer to my telegram i couldn t tell her i hadn t sent one i didn t you know so i simply answered no and then she said it was very odd that we hadn t heard from him and went on about it worrying so that i didn t know what to do and so i told her i didn t mean to but i suppose i let out a hint and she seized on it and made me tell her tell her what about about celia caught her friend s glance and faint colour came into her white cheeks as she hesitated and stuck in the sentence she was on the point of uttering then summoning up a little determination she said doggedly about his having troubles of his own how he really wasn t rich and happy now as i had always let her suppose and how margaret was ill and all i said i couldn t worry him to come now she was very upset as i was afraid she would be celia stopped and then resumed she agreed though at last about not urging him to come i promised to write and send him some money and tell him she said he was to bring margaret as soon as she is better and able to come here too she said of course they must regard this as home now but again she stopped and this time did not say any more but remained plucking nervously at a cushion cover with down cast eyes celia said evelyn gently after waiting a moment in hope she would go on of her own accord yes replied celia neither looking up nor desisting from her restless movements won t you tell me everything that s all i came away then answered celia speaking quickly in a weak defiance of fear and not looking up i mean about john why did he come here two nights ago celia went suddenly white to the lips her eyes widened slowly in intense distress and she breathed in a low strained voice you know yes i have known since yesterday you can tell me celia you must tell me so that i can help him and you does any one else know a fearful anxiety was in her question no one knows as much as i do the others who know think he killed sir roger i know he didn t the effect of this simple assertion was startling celia stretched out her hand to evelyn her breath coming in quick short gasps and cried with half incredulous joy evie do you know what you are saying yes i can prove he didn t too but it will be much easier if you tell me what he did do why he came and everything you know it s not like us to have secrets from each other oh you don t know what joy you give me yes i will tell you everything it has been so terrible bearing it alone cried celia holding on to her friend and weeping in wild relief i couldn t tell you about his coming beforehand he made me promise not to he was more afraid i think of mother s finding out about his being so worried and unhappy than of anything else and afterwards i couldn t tell you because because i was so afraid he must have done it oh evie are you sure he didn t darling what made you even think for a moment he did because i left them together answered celia in a low terrified voice and father was in one of his rages and john white and cold well he didn t replied evelyn i thought at first he did by accident of course but he didn t so tell me everything from the beginning it began about a month ago said celia with margaret getting ill that was the final misfortune i was away on a visit to the williamsons then you remember so he could write without being afraid that his letters would be noticed i have always managed to let him know when i m away from here and he told me how bad things were with him finally he asked for my help he had always refused to take a penny before he has all mother s pride you know but he couldn t get the things margaret needed if she was to have a chance of getting well and that broke it down nothing else would have i was for sending him all i could scrape together but a sudden foolish desire to see me and talk to me came over him he wrote as eagerly as a boy and made this plan father almost always went up early it seemed so easy for me to slip down and open the drawing room window and he could so easily get into the park and steal across the lawn i didn t much like it but there was no other way in which i could see him without running the risk of father s getting to hear of it and when once it had been suggested oh evie i longed to see him as much as he did to see me yes dear evelyn said understandingly and what happened i slipped down as arranged went on celia nervously that was easy i d gone to my room early you remember after saying good night to you on the plea of headache i hated hiding it from you evie but john thought it better no one should know it was about eleven i should think all lights were out downstairs and i thought every one was in bed i opened the window and he was there waiting we talked there a long while and then he said he couldn t see me properly or i him and he came in i went and turned on the light and then i heard father as he limped along in the hall i didn t know what to do i was so afraid he had seen the light and was coming straight in i thought the only thing to do was to go out and pretend i d only come down for a book or something i signed to john to stay still and stepped out she shivered and it was a moment before she went on i suppose i acted badly she said finally at any rate father suspected something he told me very angrily to give him none of my nonsense and when i tried to pass it off and to go upstairs he caught me so roughly by the arm that i cried out and and that was more than john could stand he came out and ordered father to leave me alone he was terribly angry not in father s way but white and stern he alarmed me but father after staring at him as if he could not believe his own eyes broke out into awful language and then turned on me and told me to go upstairs i would have disobeyed even if he had struck me but john said to me in a little dry voice you had better go and so hating it but not seeing how i could help i went that s all i know and when father was found like that i couldn t help believing john had done it you can imagine how i have been suffering and then when mother wanted him to come here it was dreadful evelyn had listened to every word with the deepest attention she was hearing the truth she knew when celia had finished she became very thoughtful and finally said no you couldn t help believing it i can quite understand well don t worry any more i m going to show he didn t she walked to the window and gazed out then abruptly turned and disappeared into her room she had seen philip castle strolling along away from the house chapter xi a chain of confusion without delaying a moment evelyn took the paper pattern of the footprint she had discovered from her drawer and went along the corridor to philip s room the door was standing ajar she pushed it open entered and closed it after her now that she had come to the climax of her investigations her mind for all its deadly horror was free of the tortures of uncertainty intimacy free and absolute had been regained between her and celia and she had had the joy of taking from celia the crushing belief in her brother s guilt but the criminal remained in all his blackness and her heart knew no pity there she stooped and fighting down a sense of nausea took up the pair of evening shoes on which humblethorne had pounced with avidity on his entrance the day before their smooth undarkened soles came as a sudden shock to her she had been so certain that she would have no need to look further then the same thought occurred to her as previously to humblethorne these were worn and left conspicuously about just because he had a second pair she understood completely now what humblethorne had meant but she had something which would be decisive even without the discovery of that pair with a trembling hand she took up her paper pattern and laid it on the left shoe of the two in her hand it was several sizes too large to say that she was taken aback would be hopelessly to understate the turmoil in her brain she stared at the misfit so incomprehensible so utterly unexpected as if she were seeing a ghost her breath went and came her colour left her it was against all reason past all understanding it could not be true then after a few moments of absolute blank disbelief when if was obvious that unless she had taken leave of her senses she could not by any alteration of the placing of the pattern make it coincide with the shoe her mind began to work feverishly again she could not be entirely wrong it was the shoe which was wrong it must be she knew that at any rate this was not the shoe which had left the stain perhaps the subtle mind of the man she was tracking had foreseen this and had deliberately left these small shoes about to be found by any one who came so far along the path of his crime she snatched up one after the other the left feet of the three other pairs of shoes and boots in the room the result was identically the same i m going out of my mind she thought there s something wrong somewhere it could not now be the shoe it was absurd to suppose that all the footgear was a blind it must be the pattern she decided she was agitated when she cut it out and had made it too big yes that must be it she seized the left evening shoe again hurried out of the room down the passage until she stood half breathless once more before the little dancing girl she waited a moment to steady herself and then bent down and taking the utmost pains to ensure accuracy placed the shoe over the stain she could no longer doubt her eyes the stain was too big when at last she became convinced that this was so she experienced an overpowering revulsion of feeling for an hour or more her whole soul had been sickened with the contemplation of a dastardly crime and the callous effrontery of the criminal now she was forced to believe that she had done him a great wrong it was certain now that he had not replaced the statuette it was probable he had never laid hands on it at all she was hurled in this terrible see saw of doubt back on the story she had just heard from celia john and his father had been left facing each other in the hall in deepest anger had john after all done this her mind leaping to the question instantly conceived how it might have been she pictured sir roger suddenly altering his mind about celia s departure john on an impulse running upstairs to fetch her back then the thought of the strange weapon at his elbow and the fierce flinging of it down and then perhaps philip had found him in remorse beside his father s body had decided to shield him and had let him out after john had replaced the weapon and she had just told celia john was guiltless and she could prove it that to her was the most poignant tragedy of this surprise she felt estranged from philip for ever whatever part he had played and if it had to lie between him and john she longed only to be able to say it was not john in acute agony she returned to philip s room not greatly caring now whether she ran into him or not replaced the shoe and almost automatically took up the pattern which in her bewilderment she had left lying on his dressing table she turned out of the room with a strange feeling of apathy saw she held the pattern in her hand and with an unreasoning resentment tore it to pieces she had hardly done so before she regretted the action at least she might make as certain of john as she had tried to do of philip she went into john s room and seeing an odd boot at the end of the row took it up it was a left one and she was puzzled to know what could have become of its fellow it had been there she was sure when she had looked in and found humblethorne the day before however that mattered little beside the purpose for which she had come she took up the boot and went back to the stain almost listlessly she placed the one over the other then she gave a little cry john s boot fitted no better than philip s shoe she rose unsteadily her mind in a whirl she was utterly crushed humiliated on what foolish belief in her own cleverness had she been building these fearful ideas about her friends she had seen something she did not understand and had immediately set to work to paint disloyal and hideous pictures refusing in her pride of brain to listen to the true promptings of her heart and now she had finally and conclusively proved her folly to herself philip had not been there nor john her abasement at her own self deceptions did not prevent her from a feeling of relief so great as almost to choke her but it kept in the back of her consciousness the question which still remained she put it from her kept it ignored and moved away from the fatal spot in a dazed unthinking condition content with what she knew and conscious of a great contempt for her powers of investigation it was only when she had gone some yards that she saw that she was still holding john s left boot who she thought could have taken the other one what was the point when john was innocent then she remembered that humblethorne did not know he was of course he must have taken it she wondered where humblethorne was becoming aware she had not seen him the whole morning the boot in her hand and the thought of humblethorne brought back the recollection of the meeting outside the drawing room window she could afford to smile at it now she would go and look at the window again in the light of what she knew it would interest her without tempting her to any further frightful theories she went down and entered the drawing room and saw to her surprise that the window was now standing open meanwhile humblethorne had been spending his time in the straightforward though difficult business of following up the stranger of the inn inquiry showed that he had left early on the morning after the crime walked to the railway station and there caught the a m train he had taken no ticket obviously having a return half having ascertained so much first from timmins and then by a visit to the station humblethorne walked back intending to send off a long official telegram which would start the great machinery of the police force at work in picking up the trail as he passed the post office however an idea struck him he sauntered in and over the sale of a picture postcard drifted easily into conversation with the postmaster on the great topic of the crime a skilful suggestion about the awfulness of having to write such news to the son bore unexpected fruit miss celia it appeared had written to him the postmaster was easily drawn on to talk the letter had attracted notice by being the first written to mr john since he was driven from home think of that and he had noticed the street and the suburb though he couldn t be certain of the number the telegram that humblethorne eventually dispatched in official code would do the rest humblethorne then devoted his energies to an endeavour to procure further identification either of john penterton or of philip castle from the cigarette box but as he had feared the roughness of the surface owing to the ornamentation and tooling made the discovery of any finger marks hopeless evelyn had she thought of it further only narrowly escaped falling under suspicion herself by virtue of this accident one half of his inquiry that relating to john being now finished humblethorne next directed his attention to the finding of the evidence against castle which he was firmly persuaded was still in existence he walked up to the towers and entering quietly made his way up the back stairs with unhurried unwearied persistence he searched the two large unoccupied rooms which were at the end of the passage past castle s room he found no trace whatever of what he was looking for entered john s room and repeated the process again without result puzzled he stopped wondering where he should search next his glance fell upon the boots and it occurred to him that it would still further strengthen the chain of evidence if he verified his measurements also he would re examine the window in the hope that he might find he had overlooked some proof of the identity of the man who had bolted the shutters he accordingly picked up the nearest boot of the row went downstairs and crossed the hall into the drawing room here he subjected the window and shutters to the minutest examination but shutters will not retain any impression from hands that are clean and he could still find nothing except the dirty finger marks on the lintel these he resolved to have photographed that afternoon he threw open the window at last and looked out it was pleasant there in the sun and he remained in meditation several minutes then realizing that he was idling he went out to fit the boot he had taken to the one clear impression in the soil he bent down to do so when he realized that he had stupidly brought only one boot and that the wrong one for another minute he looked the soil over to see if amongst its tramplings he could make out a right foot with sufficient clearness but saw it was hopeless and exclaimed irritably to himself i shall have to get the other that s all perhaps i can save you the trouble he heard a voice say pleasantly and straightening his back he looked up and saw evelyn at the window holding the left boot well i m hanged he exclaimed you will probably wish to fit it yourself she said leaning out relief at her failures was making her spirits rise above the humiliation of her late thoughts and she spoke almost gaily it does fit i know because i tried it yesterday he was so taken aback by her sudden appearance and her manner that she could not help smiling this is the window i always come to first isn t it she said don t grudge it me i don t understand he replied slowly do you know whose boots these are ten years ago they belonged to mr john penterton she answered coolly and feet don t change their size much after people grow up he added rather slowly from which the conclusion is to be drawn she asked that two nights ago mr penterton was let in through this window well we know that what of it it was obvious that she puzzled him he remembered too well the way she had been suddenly stricken dumb before this same window the day before and now she leant out of it inconsequent almost gay he was more than puzzled he felt a vague misgiving but he did not care to confess it perhaps you wouldn t mind telling me he said with an assumption of the official manner why if you fitted that boot here yesterday you come here with it again to day i was making sure she answered slowly i see well perhaps you would let me do the same she handed him the boot without a word and watched him fit it carefully to the impression he raised himself after having done so with an air of subdued triumph in his eyes and felt a renewal of misgiving as he noticed that in hers was only a fairly obvious amusement don t lean out of that window please he said rather stiffly you are very nearly touching the lintel and i have still to take a copy of those finger marks she drew back obediently at once and asked with interest how do you manage to do that it must be very difficult there i shall photograph those he answered the whole system of taking finger marks is extraordinarily fascinating she said i don t see how you do it oh it s not difficult when once you know how like so many things i suppose she remarked but it must require great dexterity and special training i don t know he answered insensibly his tone had become that of the expert good humouredly answering the questions of a layman and he was not altogether sorry to have an opportunity to show this clever amateur the science that lay beneath his methods of course he went on i have taken prints for years and practice makes perfect they say but i don t know that it is specially difficult how do you set about it in the ordinary way she asked well it depends of course what they are on he replied rather sententiously and you can do it in several ways yes but ordinarily oh well if they were on paper for example and you were to sprinkle a little lamp black over the place you would see all there was if on something dark well there are several things one can use fine flour does as well as anything and it shows up the marks if there are any but you have to dust it off very lightly it s the grease on the hand you see miss that makes the mark and you want something light that will stick on the place when the rest is brushed off of course you can touch plenty of things and not leave a mark anything rough for instance in moments of great agitation however the human hand becomes moist which facilitates the work of discovery i see it s very interesting well thank you i hope i haven t wasted your time oh a little smile played round her lips i know i haven t done that he was slightly nettled and how do you know he asked because well it sounds rude but i don t mean it to be because you are wasting it for yourself out there the man who made those marks is not the man who killed sir roger she nodded pleasantly and left him to stare after her with open mouth and profoundly puzzled eyes as she went slowly upstairs to luncheon celia let him in who let him out what really happened she was thinking how when and why did i begin to build up my castle of falsehood she stopped dead half way up the stairs it was the little window she remembered which had first convinced her it was philip just because she was sure celia could not have done that in her revulsion of feeling she now absolved philip afresh who broke the window then suddenly without seeking for it she remembered every word of her conversation with birts about that window how blind she had been to its real significance the breakage had not been discovered till two o clock on the day after the murder it might then have been done any time between after dinner on the night of the murder and two o clock next day it might have been done the thought came insistently on the morning after the murder it might yes but why should it have been no answer suggested itself but it was with quickened interest in the sudden opening up of a new avenue of thought that she continued her way slowly upstairs chapter xii out of the darkness during luncheon evelyn sat absorbed in her own thoughts and spoke little and then at random celia her only companion at the meal was naturally full of questions how did evelyn know john had not done it why had she left her so suddenly and the like to all of which evelyn returned evasive answers she could not shake herself free from the baffling problems of the tragedy no matter how often or how sincerely she resolved to leave them alone she had been hopelessly grievously wrong but how and why what had made her go wrong on what false basis had she reared her crazy edifices some one her mind kept repeating to her barred that window john couldn t do it himself you have heard and you believe celia s story you have followed philip s trail and it has led you to an absurdity who remains then her mind ran away with her to the new fact which had just penetrated her consciousness that there was a large margin of time inside which the little window might have been broken it was probable of course that it had been done soon after the murder but it was odd if that was so that it had not been discovered many hours earlier than it was supposing it had been done the morning after what could she make of that who could have done it and what was the reason why it was done it was so easy to make suppositions so easy to ask questions but she seemed to be led into a blank wall when she tried to answer them luncheon over she threw herself down into a low basket chair and gave herself entirely to a reconsideration of everything she had discovered the most important point to be decided was who had left that larger footmark in replacing the statuette it was not john it was not philip who else could it possibly have been as if in reply to the reiterated question there was a discreet knock on the door and fairlie entered he bent in his habitual manner of semi apology when delivering a message and said that her ladyship would be glad if miss celia would come and sit with her that afternoon evelyn reclining in her chair suddenly grew rigid her eyes had fallen upon his shoes she glanced away hurriedly fearful of betraying the agitation in her mind her thoughts had received their answer two men remained who could have broken that window fairlie and the footman the latter she put out of her reckoning at once he was an ordinary unintelligent unresourceful lad who had only been there a few months he had never known john he could not have played a part afterwards in any case even to save his neck from the gallows she could not conceive any reason except robbery and of that there was no trace here why he should murder his master but fairlie was a being of very different fibre no one could ever guess at the thoughts lying hid in that silent soul beneath his stolid mask of dignified imperturbability whatever he had done he was capable if he chose of concealing it evelyn was too fresh from the complete upsetting of all her reasoning to leap at once to new conclusions of guilt she was grown more moderate in her imaginings and no longer felt assured that any picture her mind painted was necessarily the truth but she realized in an instant the possibilities of this new thought fairlie had been devoted to john as a little child whatever had happened it would have been his first thought to avoid running the risk of implicating john she did not go so far in her thoughts as to say fairlie struck sir roger down but she saw that he might have done so he might for instance have intervened in a quarrel as to all that she did not know and refused as far as she could to speculate upon thoughts alone but at any rate fairlie might have let john out fairlie might have broken the window no one more likely it was obvious that if he was the one who had barred the window then whether it was he who hurled the statuette or no and whether that was done before or after john s departure he would have provided the semblance of some other entrance so that john s presence on the scene might never be suspected the more she thought of it the more probable it seemed that fairlie was the man she was amazed that she had never given him a thought before she recalled philip s account of how he had roused fairlie there was nothing in that to have prevented fairlie s participation during the earlier part of that long interval between thirteen minutes to twelve when sir roger left the study and half past one when he was found dead plenty of time for him to have let john out killed sir roger or killed sir roger and let john out if that was the order and gone himself to bed full of such thoughts she saw her work clear before her to find proofs which should either dispel this theory as all her others had been dispelled or make it stand out evident to all as the truth it fitted all facts so well that even in her humility she felt assured that this time it would be strange indeed if she were entirely wrong she had none of the bitter horror stricken resentment with which her belief in philip s guilt had inspired her horror she felt still certainly but also a kind of unwilling pity she could not imagine fairlie capable of what she would call a selfish crime there could be no reason for such an act whatever his feelings towards sir roger were and it was probable that beneath his respectful deference had lain a deep resentment they would never have blazed she felt into violence the thought fought itself in on her that he might have acted merely as a shield against discovery to john at this she rose hastily it was no use repeating error by vexing herself in advance needlessly it was time to act to prove not think her recent talk with humblethorne on the subject of finger marks had not been entirely conversational at the back of her mind humiliated though she had been had still lingered irrepressible interest and she had kept wondering whether it would not be possible to find on the statuette marks which would guide her towards the real truth now she would put the information given her by humblethorne to the test it was characteristic of her that she never stopped to consider the propriety of her handling the statuette for such a purpose it would have been simpler and safer to have informed humblethorne of her discovery but she had erred alone and she would succeed alone she got up from the easy chair and thought out her plans she must first get some fine flour and test the statuette she was about to go downstairs to beg some from the cook when glancing at the clock on the mantelpiece she noticed that it was just two o clock the sense of time had slipped from her she saw instantly that it would be the most ill fitting time to approach the cook but the best to pursue unobserved any private inquiry of her own the servants would all be at their dinner at once her mind was made up she went to her room took scissors and paper and hurrying to the stain which had so baffled her cut out another pattern then she made her way without noise or hesitation to the room she knew to be fairlie s outside she paused wondering what explanation she would give if she were seen but the clatter and voices in the servants hall reassured her she opened the door and stole in beneath the washstand were a couple of pairs of boots she dived at a left foot turned it over and placed her pattern upon it she had made no error this time one thing was certain now fairlie s foot had made the stain she was fearful of being discovered and had no definite object in further delay but she saw no evening shoes no doubt the pair then on his feet were those he had been wearing the evening of the murder but they might be hidden away hastily she searched the most likely places but without result she opened rapidly one after another the drawers but could find nothing she dared stay no longer and closed the drawers silently she could not quite push home the top left hand drawer however it had been closed and she was anxious to leave everything exactly as she had found it she made another attempt and became convinced something was obstructing it hurriedly she pulled the drawer right out felt at the back and to her horror drew out a dirty crumpled handkerchief stained with blood she had hardly done so when she heard the screech of a chair being pushed back in the servants hall she snatched a clean handkerchief from the drawer thrust it behind inserted and forced the drawer home and fled back to her room with her pattern and the blood stained relic crushed in her hand then locking the door she examined what she had so unexpectedly stumbled upon it was a man s ordinary white handkerchief of good but not especially fine linen it bore in the corner the initials j f right across its width from edge to edge the centre was stained with a streaky band of blood about three inches across at its widest and then narrowing irregularly to about an inch and a half and it was marked by little ribs of dirt more puzzles thought evelyn now what has this been used for she locked it away carefully and then went down as she had first intended and managed to borrow some fine flour from the cook without exciting any special interest in that good woman s lethargic mind she had supplied both celia and evelyn with many curious things in her time when they had been amusing themselves learning to cook so far evelyn had succeeded beyond her wildest dreams she had now the most delicate part of her self imposed task before her a confidence however in her own dexterity of touch if a clumsy handed man like humblethorne could do it she certainly could was her thought and a belief that any discovery her experiment might yield would at best be only additional to what she already knew helped to steady her excitement and kept her from realizing how unusual her action was she put on a pair of thin gloves went along the passage first making sure that no one was about and after examining the statuette once more as it stood lifted it down by the arm which was free of any stain she was surprised to find how heavy it was it looked slight and small in position but she realized what a terrible blow it must have inflicted hurled from that height one other thing she noticed as she carried it unobserved to her room and that was that it had become loose on its little ebony pedestal the closer inspection which was possible as soon as she was secure against observation or interruption inside her own locked door revealed that the stout pins which entered the pedestal from the feet and held the figure in place had been badly strained so that one foot had driven slightly into the pedestal to one side and then when the statuette was put again in an upright condition had shifted back leaving a distinct mark on the polished wood that the statuette had had a severe fall was placed beyond all doubt celia was a keen and skilful artist in delicate water colour so evelyn had only to slip through to the girls study and borrow a fine brush to have all her preparations made for the new experiment first of all however she practised making a few finger prints by pressing her thumb on the polished mahogany of her dressing table and sprinkling and brushing the flour she had not been quite so ignorant of the elements of the art as her questions to humblethorne had suggested and in any case did not find it particularly difficult after a few attempts she felt reasonably sure of being able to make visible whatever the statuette concealed she came to it and as she stood looking again at the bent arm a sudden knowledge came to her as to the use to which the blood stained handkerchief had been put like so much else it seemed obvious directly the thought had come at all the handkerchief had been used to wipe the arm and shoulder she took it out and examined it again in connexion with the stains on the statuette yes there could be little doubt the line of her mouth tightened a passionate impulse even if it culminated in a blow was less horrible than these evidences of a cool headed and deliberate purpose afterwards she was struck with the inconsistencies which showed themselves here before her the criminal could think to wipe the statuette move the box break the window but he had never noticed that he had put his foot in the blood well this was what she had often heard that criminals nullified a dozen careful clevernesses by a single evident oversight the agitated mind she supposed was too occupied in laying its deceptions to observe the most obvious realities her thoughts went again to the marks on the sill of the drawing room window which she had been able fully to see that morning for the first time it had struck her then that they had seemed not merely indefinite but partially obliterated she saw at once now that her thought had been right the ribs of dirt on the handkerchief so out of place in the property of a conspicuously clean and respectable butler had been made when the handkerchief had been hastily rubbed over the trodden sill she could not be sure but at least it seemed highly probable and just as the stains raised the presumption of fairlie s handling of the statuette so did the dirt of his shutting of the window she laid the handkerchief by took the statuette carefully in her gloved hand by the clean arm and tipped it over she was sure that the smooth polish of the pedestal would yield the best results and was afraid of testing the statuette itself in case she altered the appearance of the bloodstains carefully she sprinkled the fine flour over the front of the pedestal brushed the surface very lightly and then paused with shining eyes and a deep sigh half satisfaction at the correctness of her conclusions and facility of her execution half distress at the evidence of guilt before her clearly marked on the ebony towards each corner of the pedestal stood out the impressions of two large thumbs the criminal after setting it down had evidently pressed it carefully back into its exact position she sat for some minutes staring almost vacantly at the marks one link in the chain alone remained now and that was the identification of those thumbs that would not be difficult she reflected fairlie had necessarily to be always handling things she rose with quick decision the sooner her task was complete the better locked away the handkerchief cleared a drawer lifted the statuette carefully and placed it in a prone position in the drawer which she locked then she went downstairs in the hall she met humblethorne who was holding a telegram in his hand which birts had just brought him he wore a look of dissatisfaction in consequence both of an absolutely fruitless search for some further evidence the shoes for preference which should establish philip castle s participation in the escape of the murderer and also of the news he had just heard the telegram said briefly in official code that john penterton carrying a bag had left his home shortly before humblethorne s information had been received and had not returned destination at present unknown house would be watched and all steps to trace him followed humblethorne glanced at evelyn without pleasure her attitude had puzzled him and if his evidence had not been so overwhelmingly direct he would have admitted that he felt a real misgiving people do not say well we know that what of it in a matter of fact tone in such circumstances as his last meeting with evelyn unless they have a reason thinking it over he had been forced reluctantly to the conclusion that though he could prove john s secret entry he could not prove his hand in the murder he could only throw on john the onus of disproving it and whatever grounds for suspicion he might have he knew that so far he had found no proof against philip whatever he had no doubt in his own mind but this girl showed up to him fearlessly almost he felt cynically the weaknesses of his case miss temple he said as she was passing the two men i think you ought to be told a little how the case stands it will be my duty very shortly to make a very painful communication to lady penterton i think it would be as well if she was prepared she may see it in the paper at any moment now evelyn shot a keen glance at him and his telegram and then replied quietly it would be foolish of me to pretend i do not understand has mr penterton been arrested not yet humblethorne admitted rather reluctantly but it is only a question of a few hours now before he will be then you have still time to avoid making a mistake publicly she replied i advise you to use it your good opinion of your friend s brother does you credit remarked humblethorne drily i regret i cannot share it it is hardly a question of good opinion she returned boldly but of proof you know very well that you have none humblethorne flushed at this direct blow i have proof of things that will need a good deal of explanation he said shortly you shall have all the explanation you require in half an hour she said delay the arrest that length of time and you will have no reason to regret it what do you mean he exclaimed you have been looking for a pair of evening shoes i think she went on with apparent irrelevance yes he tried unsuccessfully to hide his eagerness i will show you them in half an hour wait that long at any rate she nodded and went into the dining room chapter xiii how it happened with a heart beating with excitement evelyn opened the door that led from the dining room into the pantry luck favoured her for fairlie was in there alone oh fairlie she said in the most natural voice she could assume i m so thirsty can you give me a glass of water as he went to fetch it her mind was in a ferment she had promised to explain everything in half an hour but could she there was much she could only guess even if her deductions all proved to be facts and it suddenly crossed her mind that if the finger marks on the pedestal did not prove to be fairlie s she was as far from the truth as ever at any rate she had come to a point when she must share all her discoveries with humblethorne fairlie now returned with a glass of water on a small silver tray she took the latter carefully by the opposite side then wishing to duplicate his finger prints in case of failure she said that looks a little dusty fairlie and lifted the tray towards him unsuspectingly he took the glass held it up against the light and then set it down again on the tray it looks all right to me miss evelyn but i ll get you another he replied oh no don t trouble she exclaimed and bore away tray and glass as she passed through the hall again she was very conscious of the curious not to say suspicious gaze of the two men but she was too intent on her purpose and that purpose held too much that was terrible for her to feel the amusement which would otherwise have been hers without looking at them she carried her last evidence carefully upstairs well remarked birts with a heavy sigh as she disappeared i wonder what she s up to now play acting i call it humblethorne did not reply though his thoughts were running in the same direction he was uneasy it was difficult to stifle altogether the conviction that this girl whose quick brain and perceptive eye had already aroused his appreciation would not speak so confidently unless she had something better than a mere belief to go upon he was moodily pacing the hall when evelyn came downstairs again i am ready now she said i asked for half an hour but it did not take so long perhaps you will be good enough to explain your mysteries then remarked humblethorne with slight irony i will tell you everything i have discovered she answered it does not explain everything i know but it explains enough for you to be able to find out the rest i have gone as far as i can alone she added simply and my only course now is to place it in your hands to use as you think fit humblethorne was mollified he had been afraid she was going to taunt him with failure but with the end of her task a heaviness had fallen upon her to investigate was interesting to discover horrible let us go into the drawing room she said we cannot be overheard there and here as i know we can be oh i want you first to look at this i don t wonder it was overlooked i only found it by accident and she took the two men to the dent under the cornice level with the third step of the stairs you never saw the cigarettes in their original positions i think she said to humblethorne as he bent over to look at it with his interest roused instantly to the full no did you he queried instantly no but after i found this dent yesterday i asked mr castle to tell me exactly where they had lain it was obvious when i came to look again that they had fallen out when the cigarette box struck the wall here she spoke simply intent on her explanation and looked up in surprise when humblethorne seeing the full significance of her remark gave a sudden exclamation and cried excitedly struck the wall when was that before sir roger was killed obviously she answered how long before i do not know but but he began trying to assimilate this new and startling fact it does rather upset one s preconceived ideas doesn t it she said but i do not see how the conclusion is to be avoided the box would hardly be thrown after sir roger lay dead you have made a discovery of the very greatest importance miss temple humblethorne asserted i will not deny that but this doesn t clear john penterton i am aware of that she replied the unconscious touch of condescension had not escaped her perhaps it would help if you told me what evidence you have against him i know he was here miss penterton had arranged some while ago that he should come is that evidence that he is guilty of his father s death while she was speaking the dining room door opened and fairlie came quietly into the hall that remains to be seen returned humblethorne he came secretly at night time and there are several questions to be answered did his father know of his coming was his father alive when he left who let him out his father was killed that evening if he didn t kill him who did answer me that miss temple as the questions followed each other evelyn felt as if the ground were opening under her feet she had still all the evidence of the statuette but she realized with a sudden pang that that did not answer the one dreadful question was his father alive when he left she turned uneasily and saw fairlie standing in the doorway his guard was down as he listened and a terrible indecision was written on his face evelyn read him like a book his young master was accused in spite of the way he had tried to cover up the trail it was known that john had been there and there was no one now alive except fairlie himself who could save him and he could only save him by admitting his own guilt so evelyn understood the look of doubt and agony with which the old man s usually settled face was working whether left to himself he would have risen to a confession was never decided humblethorne s final words had been a challenge as one should say certainly i did overlook this dent which you admit you yourself only found by accident but what difference does it really make and almost without thinking evelyn took up the challenge if he didn t kill him who did she repeated look behind you there stands your answer in the shoes for which you have been searching both men wheeled sharply fairlie they gasped the butler s face set again just as if a curtain had fallen across the vivid drama momentarily revealed and he came forward paler than usual bowed down a little by age and the fearful thoughts within him but retaining his imperturbable manner undiminished i do not understand how you have ascertained the fact miss evelyn he said searching her with a slow keen glance but speaking in his normal respectful voice but it is quite true that i killed sir roger take care cried humblethorne sharply it is my duty to warn you that anything you say may be used in evidence against you i quite understand that replied fairlie with a characteristically gracious inclination of his body towards humblethorne i am obliged to you but since i have been discovered there is no further object in concealment i am not sorry he added wearily perhaps you will excuse me if i sit down a moment he seated himself after an apologetic glance at evelyn with the air of a man who has neither hope nor fear of any future thing the two men were too taken aback at the extraordinary suddenness of the accusation and confession to say a word evelyn was too overwhelmed with the conflict in her mind horror pity and a kind of dreadful fascination in this fulfilment of her labours i will tell you how it happened resumed fairlie slowly there has been enough of mystery in this house will you tell me miss evelyn how you found me out i knew that mr john couldn t have done it when i found the dent in the wall showing the box had missed she replied so i searched for the real weapon at first i thought i didn t know what to think i knew it was some one in the house miss celia had not let mr john out nor broken the pantry window by the way when did you break that about ten minutes to two yesterday when the other servants were just sitting down to dinner why i didn t want mr john s name brought into it i was hurried the night before and didn t think of it in the morning i saw from the inspector s questions that it was necessary to provide a way in for an ordinary burglar or else they would find out mr john had been here and suspect him though of course he had nothing whatever to do with it or get on my tracks as you have done but i don t see how you did miss evelyn i found the statuette she said simply the statuette exclaimed humblethorne bewildered yes i will show it you later oh i know you wiped it fairlie she added seeing mystification still on his face i have the handkerchief you used both for that and for the window sill but the right arm has plenty of stains on it still then you left a footprint on the wood below and marks of both thumbs on the pedestal when you replaced it the old man was silent for several minutes then he said slowly i have made many mistakes i fear i am a poor criminal i didn t think it out you see this was how it happened i had locked up and put the lights out and should have gone to bed only sir roger was sitting up in his study with mr castle and i thought he might want something and ring and if he did he would be very angry if no one came so i busied myself with the silver and one thing and another to pass the time sir roger did not used to sit up late i was in the dining room putting away the last of the silver when i heard him coming along the passage the door was ajar and i could hear him quite well the hall was in darkness according to orders as i told you he inclined towards humblethorne who nodded but sir roger was very contrary i heard him swearing at me for not leaving a light on and saying i was too old and he d give me notice to morrow i stepped across and put out the dining room light for fear he should see it and come in and give me notice then and there that would have been like him he was very hasty always and had hardly done so before i heard him give a sharp exclamation i wondered what was up and i pulled the door more open very quietly and looked out i saw miss celia standing there in front of the drawing room door and he was going on at her insisting that she was up to some mischief and then she tried to pass him and go upstairs and he caught hold of her arm she gave a little cry he was always rough was sir roger and then out of the drawing room came mr john i hadn t seen him for ten years or more and nor had sir roger but we both recognized him at once sir roger used dreadful language at him you know of course the way he drove him from home and then ordered miss celia to her room saying he d deal with her later she was for staying but mr john saw she couldn t do any good and he told her to go too then sir roger began on mr john and called him all the things he could think of dreadful the way he went on it was and at last he raised his stick and made as if to strike at him mr john had stood there very quietly not saying a word he knew it wasn t no use but when he saw sir roger lift his stick at him he picked up that cigarette box which was just by his hand and threw it at him not fierce like but just to keep him off it hit the wall and the cigarettes fell all over the stairs and mr john gave a short laugh and ran back into the drawing room and i didn t see him again what time was this interposed humblethorne as fairlie paused twelve o clock struck just afterwards replied fairlie well what then interjected birts after a moment s silence then resumed fairlie slowly i slipped away and turned up the back stairs and round to the top there where i could see down into the hall i thought it was my duty to remonstrate with sir roger if he intended to go to miss celia in the state he was in he would have thrashed her as likely as not i couldn t stand by and see that he was still in the hall muttering to himself he was just below me and it came over me all of a sudden what with the fear of him giving me notice and the fear of him lifting his hand to miss celia but there i can t explain it he heard me up there looked up and somehow when i see his face like that i felt that he wasn t fit to live and i tipped the statuette down on him he just fell and never moved again fairlie paused took out his handkerchief blew his nose solemnly and then replaced his handkerchief carefully i was filled with horror he went on at what i had done naturally but he was dead and couldn t be brought to life again it was as i was going downstairs i saw how thoughtless i d acted people that didn t know him might think mr john had had a hand in it so after seeing that sir roger was really dead i went and fastened up the drawing room window using my handkerchief as miss evelyn guessed to clean the sill in case of boot marks then i came back and thought what was best to be done first i picked up the cigarette box and put it down beside sir roger i wouldn t have done that if i hadn t been agitated i was just thinking that would seem as if sir roger had come on some burglar and having shut mr john out i didn t think of him any more but i was agitated and didn t think clear then i picked up the statuette wiped it with my handkerchief and put it back on the bracket upstairs if i hadn t been hurried i should have seen i had blood on my shoe i made a great many mistakes he sighed deeply i ought to have broken the pantry window then but i didn t think it out i saw that i had to be in bed when the body was found and i knew mr castle was still in his study so i hurried to my room and i only just had time to get undressed and into bed before mr castle came along that s just what happened he sighed again heavily and sat still looking old and wearied but still indomitably respectable there was a long silence when he had finished broken only by the stertorous breathing of birts as he waited for orders from his superior officer it was the most dramatic moment of birts s life and would be told by him with proper pride for years afterwards you will remain in charge of the prisoner birts said humblethorne at length i will see what miss temple has to show me very good sir replied birts stolidly let us go up said evelyn hurriedly this was dreadful she paused a moment hesitating before fairlie she could not leave him without a word oh fairlie she cried suddenly i am terribly sorry why why did you do it don t take on miss evelyn fairlie replied looking up the light of kindly affection coming for an instant over his sombre face what s done is done i didn t think things out that was where i went wrong his face settled back into solemn imperturbability and with a heavy load upon her heart evelyn led humblethorne upstairs when she had shown him the bracket on which the statuette had stood and the footprint below it she briefly described the course of her investigations from that point omitting however all reference to her doubts of john and philip then she took him to her room and handed over to his charge the statuette and the handkerchief and the glass and tray which had identified the thumb marks i acted carefully on the information you kindly gave me she said it was not as difficult as i had supposed you have certainly shown remarkable resource and if i may say so courage miss temple humblethorne remarked as he fastened up the evidence with much precaution against injury it was taking a serious responsibility to handle this statuette after what you suspected perhaps she returned vaguely it is necessary sometimes at any rate i have finished now and i wish i had never started it is horrible to feel my hand has doomed one who has been really an old friend she shuddered and then added well at any rate you need not trouble about mr penterton this is the end yes repeated humblethorne thoughtfully this is the end if fairlie is speaking the truth the whole truth i mean but is he without waiting for an answer he bowed to evelyn in acknowledgment of her services and left the room chapter xiv sight at last it was some minutes before evelyn gathered her thoughts together after humblethorne s parting remark it startled her into fresh speculation just when she thought she could at last put the whole dreadful business firmly from her mind then resentment came to her rescue how like that little man she thought he will never own that he has been hopelessly wrong he began by believing john did it and he still believes it well what does it matter he can t bring a shred of evidence to support what isn t true with that she made a great effort to throw off the fear he had left with her she looked into the room she used with celia hoping to find her friend and tell her what had taken place the room was empty and evelyn remembered that celia was sitting with her mother they would both have to know and she had better go and tell them at once for fear of their hearing the news suddenly from a less sympathetic source however broken it was bound to be a terrible shock to lady penterton fairlie had been a servant to her and her father for over forty years and there was a very real and deep attachment between them it was an unpleasant task but she obviously could not avoid it reluctantly she went along the passage to lady penterton s boudoir no one was there and she went on to the bedroom she had visited with the first news of the tragedy now she had to complete the tale she knocked lightly and entered celia was sitting in an armchair reading in a low voice to her mother who was lying back in her bed wan and listless as evelyn looked at the fine weary face celia s description of her mother the day before as very quiet but somehow very old returned to her mind with vivid force here s evelyn mother said celia breaking off from her reading how are you feeling to day aunt eleanor said evelyn bending over the bed and kissing the old lady i thought you would be in your boudoir i meant to get up dear she replied in a dull voice she did get as far as the loggia yesterday said celia yes the sun tempted me but it tried me too much lady penterton sighed and relapsed into silence for a minute more evelyn sat stroking tenderly the wrinkled hand i have something to tell you both she said at length i am afraid it will distress you but you will have to know and it is better that i should tell you than any one else lady penterton turned her head wearily on the pillow towards her while celia laid down her book with a sharp intake of the breath i have stumbled more by chance than any skill on things the detectives happened to overlook they had a certain idea in their heads she glanced across at celia to try and read whether she had told her mother of john and received a quick negative shake of the head and perhaps that blinded them to anything else i don t know but i found footmarks and finger prints they had not seen and i followed them up she paused uncertain how best to break the conclusion of that following up lady penterton s agitation at this talk of the tragedy was evident my dear child she exclaimed her hand tightening nervously on evelyn s what an extraordinary thing for you to do yes perhaps it was admitted evelyn but i didn t stop to think about that oh what did you find how dreadful it all is i found said evelyn slowly unwillingly that it was done by fairlie by fairlie uttered the old lady turning so white that evelyn thought she was going to faint it is dreadful i know but when charged with it he confessed celia started up crying in amazement fairlie and lady penterton with a deep sigh fell back her fingers relaxed and she lay white and still both girls terribly alarmed bent over her evelyn ran to the washstand for cold water and then said quickly to celia send for the doctor i ll attend to her but as she spoke lady penterton recovered herself her lips moved and then she said faintly fairlie fairlie confessed evelyn was that what you said no to celia who was slipping out stay with me i don t want any one i know it is terrible news for you aunt eleanor evelyn said very gently but there is no doubt about it i m afraid he did it by flinging down the statuette of the little dancing girl that stands on the bracket by the stairs you know the one i mean she saw a sign of understanding on lady penterton s lips as she lay rigidly still with eyes closed and continued he left his finger marks on the pedestal and a footprint underneath why he did it i hardly know he doesn t really know himself it was a mad impulse which he says he can t explain how dreadful exclaimed celia pale with emotion oh how dreadful lady penterton lay only her lips moving nervously inaudibly while the two girls watched her with anxiety at last she opened her eyes her lips closed tightly and it was obvious that she was making a great effort to regain the self possession from which she had been so startlingly shaken i should like to see him she said oh mother exclaimed celia in protest he has been with me most of my life answered lady penterton simply i felt the same said evelyn in a low voice to celia it will distress her more if she doesn t then to lady penterton i will fetch him thank you dear lady penterton closed her eyes again with a little sigh as of a weariness almost intolerable evelyn went downstairs and found humblethorne and birts on the point of departure with fairlie in their custody i have just been with lady penterton and told her she said she wishes to see fairlie may she he has been with her so long she feels she cannot let him go without saying a few words to him well said humblethorne it s not exactly regular but i don t see that there can be any harm in stretching a point it can do no good said fairlie i do not wish to see her ladyship in these altered circumstances oh fairlie exclaimed the girl it will distress her so much more if she doesn t do this for her at least fairlie kept his eyes upon the ground and hesitated a long while it can do no good he repeated doggedly i am afraid she will be really ill unless she is given in to in this little way it need only be for a moment well for a moment miss evelyn he straightened his bowed shoulders but i am sure you will appreciate how painful it is for me yes yes i know but just for a moment she will feel less unhappy afterwards he signified that he assented and the four of them went upstairs to the bedroom evelyn knocked and entered first he is here aunt eleanor she said but he did not wish to come fairlie fairlie cried the old lady sitting up in her emotion with a sudden accession of strength what does this mean he remained obstinately silent before the mistress he had served so long and faithfully it was evident that he found it difficult to maintain the air of stolid half resigned half defiant gloom which had settled down upon him like a cloak he shifted uneasily from one foot to another he kept his eyes on the carpet and his breath came irregularly what a servant what a friend you have always been fairlie continued the old lady in the strained high pitched voice of intense feeling looking at him with wide eyes which glistened with tears in the happy years before i married i remember you so well in the long dark years afterwards you have been oh like a shield standing by ready to help always and now her gaze faltered and wandered from the bowed uneasy figure until it met humblethorne s and she went on you do not get servants like that nowadays he has been with me over forty years her eyes left humblethorne and rested on evelyn how clever you have been evelyn she exclaimed as if a new thought had entered her weary restless brain i do not understand at all how you made it out very clever but quite wrong wrong cried evelyn astounded yes dear said lady penterton fairlie didn t kill sir roger she paused for the fraction of a second as she looked at him i did on all but one of her audience this announcement delivered with such rapidity that none could forecast the direction in which her apparently haphazard remarks were tending came with the effect of a thunderclap you they cried in a single voice of stupefaction but on fairlie the effect was very different he started forward in the attempt to check her speech but was too late then seizing her hand he pressed it to his lips as he cried in tones of acutest distress oh my lady my lady why did you speak i would have died willingly i would i know i believe you she answered bending over him with a rare tenderness but i could not allow that i don t understand cried evelyn finding her voice at last you killed him aunt eleanor you but i will tell you all about it said lady penterton still looking at fairlie and paying very little attention to anybody else i never meant not to only it was so terrible and got harder instead of easier it is very simple it was quite an accident oh i did not mean to did you think i did fairlie i didn t know my lady i couldn t see very clearly it was too dark where were you just inside the dining room my lady oh i see that explains it she leant back and closed her eyes i think said humblethorne after waiting several moments for her to go on that we must hear everything now i never thought fairlie was speaking the truth before but i was returned fairlie rising and facing the inspector up to a point that is everything i told you was as it happened up to the time sir roger was left alone in the hall what happened then the truth this time of course replied fairlie with dignity i saw her ladyship look over the stairs wondering i suppose what was happening the cigarette box made a bit of noise hitting the wall and falling naturally and i suppose her ladyship heard it he glanced in a respectful way at lady penterton but she was lying back as if exhausted and made no sign sir roger stood there muttering curses under his breath and waving his stick and i saw her ladyship lean forward the banisters creaked and sir roger looked up and then something fell down and hit him on the forehead her ladyship gave a little cry and stood there wringing her hands and then after a minute she came downstairs she stood as if she didn t dare go actually to him i think even then she was afraid of him and presently she made a shuddering sound i can t describe it any differently i saw her pick up the statuette in a kind of wondering way and then she went upstairs as if she was terrified when she was at the top i saw her stop suddenly she was looking at what she had caught hold of in her hands i could see she didn t know how it got there she put it down and stood holding her elbow as if it hurt her and shaking in a kind of way as if she didn t know what she was doing and then she gave a dreadful gasp and i could hear her sobbing as she went along to her room it was terrible for me to hear her ladyship like that then i acted just as i told you i was afraid there would be stains on the statuette and that it wasn t put back proper he stopped and looked at lady penterton who raised herself up on one elbow and gazed at him if you had only told me you were there she said how much better it would have been oh the awfulness of that silent hall she shuddered convulsively tell us everything my lady said humblethorne she did not seem at first to hear it was some minutes before she could gain control of herself and summon up the resolution to speak it is very simple she said at last tremblingly i was reading in my boudoir later than usual the book was interesting and i was just thinking of going to bed when i heard my husband s voice raised in anger in the hall at first i tried to take no notice it was she paused and looked piteously at fairlie before continuing it was not uncommon but it went on and at last i came out to listen he was standing at the foot of the stairs calling some one names i could not see whom and no one answered humblethorne shot a searching glance at evelyn who said in a whisper she does not know she has not been told the silence seemed to infuriate my husband he was i am afraid like that went on lady penterton oblivious of this by play he raised his stick and cried out some threatening words the person it must have been some one come on business and my husband hated being disturbed in that way here made a movement and then i saw something bright hit the wall and fall with a clatter i don t quite know what it was and then i heard steps of some one going away my husband remained where he was but his anger was terrible to see it frightened me i leant against the balusters trembling and they made a noise my husband looked up and saw me i leaned over to speak to him and i knocked against the statuette i have the mark on my elbow now i was trembling so that i couldn t catch it and it fell she stopped breathless in terrible agitation celia went to her took her hand and held it in silence and in a minute she went on again more calmly i ought to have told somebody at once of course i ought if i had known fairlie was there i would have called to him but there seemed to be no one i listened and could not hear a sound i came down and called to my husband in a whisper but he did not answer and i was afraid then i don t know what happened i don t remember anything clearly i found myself at the top of the stairs with that dreadful statuette in my hands i could not think i don t really remember what i did i was terrified and i hurried to my room i had lent my maid to miss penterton there was no one there my mind was making strange patterns and it was difficult to see i got to bed i do not remember how and then i could think and the worst was i could not i could not cry i tried to but i could not i suppose i was too terrified it was such a dreadful end to his life that he should have died like that whilst he was so angry it was so dreadful that it should have been through me his wife i have tried so hard always and then this happened if i had been a bad wife i should not have minded so much but i have tried always to be patient and then you came addressing evelyn and told me he had been found oh what a relief that was but i could not tell you then i did not care about any one finding out i did not care about anything but i could not tell any one it was too dreadful only when you told me it was fairlie and he had confessed i saw then he was trying to save me as he has tried all my married life and i had to tell she fell silent and humblethorne was just about to speak when a voice was heard outside a rapid knock shook the door which was flung open and john penterton entered his glance swept the company with surprise and encountering humblethorne took on a vague recognition but his whole interest was with his mother who gave a sudden wild cry john my boy my boy she stretched out her arms to him and he went straight to them i did not know any one was with you mother he said as soon as he could speak i was told you were in your bedroom and came straight up i saw the awful news in the paper and started as soon as i could didn t you get my letter cried celia in surprise no i have had no letter he answered but i saw i must come here at once it was obvious from the account that it was the only thing i could do to clear myself as i had been here that night as you had been here john cried the old lady in a voice rising almost to a scream was it you was it you down there merciful heavens why wasn t i told oh my boy they might have suspected you humblethorne had no longer the least doubt that he had now heard the whole truth of the mysterious tragedy the old lady s tears of welcome and joy at the sudden appearance of her son had dispelled from it the last uncertainty he rose to the occasion now no one my lady he said with a grand air had any real reason to do that he opened the door and summoning the agape birts with his eye said as he passed through you will wish to be alone now with him no doubt my lady birts and fairlie followed him and evelyn also left brother and sister to explain everything to one another and to their mother if you don t mind taking a tip from me miss temple she heard humblethorne saying in her ear as they went along the passage you have a real gift but you make one mistake what is that she asked without the least interest in thinking that there can be only one explanation of any set of facts he replied now i have had years of experience and i know that the same facts can often be explained in several different ways and you see now that i m right yes she answered slowly i see now it is wonderful to see at last isn t it the end transcriber s note this transcription follows the text of the edition published by longmans green and co with the exception of the following changes made to correct what
