subject the offender to the penalty provided by law goetia the lesser key of king solomon y a preface this translation of the first book of the lemegeton which is now for the first time made accessible to students of talismanic magic was done after careful collation and edition from numerous ancient manuscripts in hebrew latin and french by g h fra ddcf by the order of the secret chief of the rosicrucian order the g h fra having succumbed unhappily to the assaults of the four great princes acting notably under martial influences it seemed expedient that the work should be brought to its conclusion by another hand the investigation of a competent skryer into the house of our unhappy fra confirmed this divination neither our fra nor his hermetic mul were there seen but only the terrible shapes of the evil adepts sva and h whose original bodies having been sequestered by justice were no longer of use to them on this we stayed no longer our hand but withdrawing ourselves and consulting the rota and the books m and q did decide to ask mr aleister crowley a poet and skilled student of magical lore and an expert kabbalist to complete openly that which had been begun in secret this is that which is written his bishoprick let another take and again oculi tetragammaton this is also that which is said nomen secundum refertur ad gebhurah qui est rex bittul atque corruptio achurajim patris et matris hoc indigitatur and so saying we wish you well ex deo nascimur in jesu morimur per ss reviviscimus given forth from our mountain of a this day of cc a d footnote mr a e waite writes real history of the rosicrucians p i beg leave to warn my readers that all persons who proclaim themselves to be rosicrucians are simply members of pseudofraternities and that there is that difference between their assertion and the fact of the case in which the essence of a lie consists it is within the editors personal knowledge that mr waite was and still is probably a member of a society claiming to be the rc fraternity as mr waite constantly hints in his writing that he is in touch with initiated centres i think the syllogism whose premises are given above is fair if not quite formaled footnote it was owing to our fra receiving this sva as his superior and giving up the arcana of our fraternity into so unhallowed a power that we decided no longer to leave our dignity and authority in the hands of one who could be thus easily imposed upon for by a childish and easy magical trick did sva persuade ddcf of that lie footnote he that is appointed to complete in secret that which had been begun openly is rr and to be heard of at the care of the editor preliminary invocation thee i invoke the bornless one thee that didst create the earth and the heavens thee

be obedient unto me iao sabao such are the words goetia the lesser key of solomon the initiated interpretation of ceremonial magic it is loftily amusing to the student of magical literature who is not quite a fooland rare is such a combinationto note the criticism directed by the philistine against the citadel of his science truly since our childhood has ingrained into us not only literal belief in the bible but also substantial belief in alf laylah wa laylah and only adolescence can cure us we are only too liable in the rush and energy of dawning manhood to overturn roughly and rashly both these classics to regard them both on the same level as interesting documents from the standpoint of folklore and anthropology and as nothing more even when we learn that the bible by a profound and minute study of the text may be forced to yield up qabalistic arcana of cosmic scope and importance we are too often slow to apply a similar restorative to the companion volume even if we are the luck holders of burtons veritable edition to me then it remains to raise the alf laylah wa laylah into its proper place once more i am not concerned to deny the objective reality of all magical phenomena if they are illusions they are at least as real as many unquestioned facts of daily life and if we follow herbert spencer they are at least evidence of some cause now this fact is our base what is the cause of my illusion of seeing a spirit in the triangle of art every smatterer every expert in psychology will answer that cause lies in your brain english children pace the education act are taught that the universe lies in infinite space hindu children in the akasa which is the same thing those europeans who go a little deeper learn from fichte that the phenomenal universe is the creation of the ego hindus or europeans studying under hindu gurus are told that by akasa is meant the chitakasa the chitakasa is situated in the third eye ie in the brain by assuming higher dimensions of space we can assimilate this fact to realism but we have no need to take so much trouble this being true for the ordinary universe that all senseimpressions are dependent on changes in the brain we must include illusions which are after all senseimpressions as much as realities are in the class of phenomena dependent on brainchanges magical phenomena however come under a special subclass since they are willed and their cause is the series of real phenomena called the operations of ceremonial magic these consist of sight the circle square triangle vessels lamps robes implements etc sound the invocations smell the perfumes taste the sacraments touch as under mind the combination of all these and reflection on their significance these unusual impressions produce unusual brainchanges hence their summary is of unusual kind its projection back into the apparently phenomenal world is therefore unusual herein then consists the reality of the operations and effects of ceremonial magic and i conceive that the apology is ample as far as the effects refer only to those phenomena which appear to the magician himself the appearance of the spirit his conversation possible shocks from imprudence and so on even to ecstasy on the one hand and death or madness on the other but can any of the effects described in this our book goetia be obtained and if so can you give a rational explanation of the circumstances say you so i can and will the spirits of the goetia are portions of the human brain their seals therefore represent mr spencers projected cube methods of stimulating or regulating those particular spots through the eye the names of god are vibrations calculated to establish a general control of the brain establishment of functions relative to the subtle world b control over the brain in detail rank or type of the spirit c control of one special portion name of the spirit the perfumes aid this through smell usually the perfume will only tend to control a large area but there is an attribution of perfumes to letters of the alphabet enabling one by a qabalistic formula to spell out the spirits name i need not enter into more particular discussion of these points the intelligent reader can easily fill in what is lacking if then i say with solomon the spirit cimieries teaches logic what i mean is those portions of my brain which subserve the logical faculty may be stimulated and developed by following out the processes called the invocation of cimieries and this is a purely materialistic rational statement it is independent of any objective hierarchy at all philosophy has nothing to say and science can only suspend judgment pending a proper and methodical investigation of the facts alleged unfortunately we cannot stop there solomon promises us that we can obtain information destroy our enemies understand the voices of nature obtain treasure heal diseases etc i have taken these five powers at random considerations of space forbid me to explain all brings up facts from subconsciousness here we come to an interesting fact it is curious to note the contrast between the noble means and the apparently vile ends of magical rituals the latter are disguises for sublime truths to destroy our enemies is to realize the illusion of duality to excite compassion ah mr waite the world of magic is a mirror wherein who sees muck is muck a careful naturalist will understand much from the voices of the animals he has studied long even a child knows the difference of a cats miauling and purring the faculty may be greatly developed business capacity may be stimulated abnormal states of the body may be corrected and the involved tissues brought back to tone in obedience to currents started from the brain so for all other phenomena there is no effect which is truly and necessarily miraculous our ceremonial magic fines down then to a series of minute though of course empirical physiological experiments and whoso will carry them through intelligently need not fear the result i have all the health and treasure and logic i need i have no time to waste there is a lion in the way for me these practices are useless but for the benefit of others less fortunate i give them to the world together with this explanation of and apology for them i trust that the explanation will enable many students who have hitherto by a puerile objectivity in their view of the question obtained no results to succeed that the apology may impress upon our scornful men of science that the study of the bacillus should give place to that of the baculum the little to the greathow great one only realizes when one identifies the wand with the mahalingam up which brahma flew at the rate of yojanas a second for mahakalpas down which vishnu flew at the rate of croces of yojanas a second for crores of mahakalpasyet neither reached an end but i reach an end boleskine house foyers nb footnote this incidentally is perhaps the greatest argument we possess pushed to its extreme against the advaitist theories footnote thought is a secretion of the brain weissmann consciousness is a function of the brain huxley footnote apart from its value in obtaining onepointedness preliminary definition of magic lemegeton vel clavicula salomonis regis magic is the highest most absolute and most divine knowledge of natural philosophy advanced in its works and wonderful operations by a right understanding of the inward and occult virtue of things so that true agents being applied to proper patients strange and admirable effects will thereby be produced whence magicians are profound and diligent searchers into nature they because of their skill know how to anticipate an effort the which to the vulgar shall seem to be a miracle origen saith that the magical art doth not contain anything subsisting but although it should yet that it must not be evil or subject to contempt or scorn and doth distinguish the natural magic from that which is diabolical apollonius tyannaeus only exercised the natural magic by the which he did perform wonderful things philo hebraeus saith that true magic by which we do arrive at the understanding of the secret works of nature is so far from being contemptible that the greatest monarchs and kings have studied it nay among the persians none might reign unless he was skilful in this great art this noble science often degenerateth from natural becometh diabolical and from true philosophy turneth unto nigromancy the which is wholly to be charged upon its followers who abusing or not being capable of that high and mystical knowledge do immediately hearken unto the temptations of sathan and are misled by him into the study of the black art hence it is that magic lieth under disgrace and they who seek after it are vulgarly esteemed sorcerers the fraternity of the rosie crusians thought it not fit to style themselves magicians but rather philosophers and they be not ignorant empiricks but learned and experienced physicians whose remedies be not only lawful but divine footnote this preliminary definition of magic is found in very few codices and is probably later than the body of the work footnote or actives footnote or passives footnote or effect footnote or the black art as distinct from mere necromancy or divination by the dead footnote or quacks and pretenders vide note on p the brief introductory description nb this is taken from several ms codices of which the four principal variations are here composed together in parallel columns as an example of the close agreement of the various texts of the lemegeton for in the whole work the differences in the wording of the various codices are not sufficient to require the constant giving of parallel readings but except in the more ancient examples there is much deterioration in the seals and sigils so that in this latter respect the more recent exemplars are not entirely reliable clavicula salomonis regis which containeth all the names offices and orders of all the spirits that ever he had converse with with the seals and characters to each spirit and the manner of calling them forth to visible appearance in parts viz the first part is a book of evil spirits called goetia showing how he bound up those spirits and used them in general things whereby he obtained great

together under the name of the first and second parts of the book theurgia of solomon the fifth book of the lemegeton is one of prayers and orations the which solomon the wise did use upon the altar in the temple and the titles hereof be ars nova the new art and ars notaria the notary art the which was revealed to him by michael that holy angel of god in thunder and in lightning and he further

magical circle this is the form of the magical circle of king solomon the which he made that he might preserve himself therein from the malice of these evil spirits see frontispiece figure this

outside the circle the outer triangles where te tra gram ma ton is written are filled in bright yellow and the centres with the t crosses written therein are red footnote the coiled serpent is only shown in one private codex the hebrew names being in most cases simply written round in a somewhat spiral arrangement within the double circle it is to be remembered that hebrew is always written from right to left instead of from left to right like ordinary european languages the small maltese crosses are placed to mark the conclusion of each separate set of hebrew names these names are those of

in the various codices the seal in figure was made in brass to cover this vessel with at the top this history of the genii shut up in the brazen vessel by king solomon recalls the story of the fisherman and the jinni in the arabian nights in this tale however there was only one jinni shut up in a vessel of yellow brass the which was covered at the top with a leaden seal this jinni tells the fisherman that his name is sakhr or sacar colourbronze lettersblack on a red band the secret seal of solomon this is the form of the secret seal of solomon wherewith he did bind and seal up the

is so made thou shalt perfume it with alum raisins dried in the sun dates cedar and lignum aloes also by this seal king solomon did command all the aforesaid spirits in the vessel of brass and did seal it up with this same seal he by it gained the love of all manner of persons and overcame in battle for neither weapons nor fire nor water could hurt him and this privy seal was made to cover the vessel at the top withal etc note figures to inclusive are interesting as showing a marked resemblance to the central design of the secret seal it will be observed that the evident desire is to represent hieroglyphically a person raising his or her hands in adoration nearly all are stone sepulchral steles and the execution of them is rough and primitive in the extreme most are in the muse du louvre at paris figures and are from the district of constantine and show a figure raising its arms in adoration in figure also from constantine the person bears a palm branch in the right hand above is a hieroglyphic representing either the lunar disc or the sun in the heavens but more probably the former figure is a more complicated stele above is the symbol already mentioned then comes the sign of the pentagram represented by a fivepointed star towards which the person raises his or her hands besides the latter is a rude form of caduceus a brief inscription follows in the punic character the punic or carthaginian language is usually considered to have been a dialect of phnician and carthage was of course a colony of tyre beneath the tunic inscription is a horses head in better drawing than the sculpture of the rest of the stele which would seem to imply that the rudeness of the representation of the human figure is intentional this and the following stele are also from constantine in figure again the horse is best delineated by far in addition to the other symbols there is either a hand or a foot for it is almost impossible to distinguish which at the head of the stele followed by an eggandtongue moulding the figure of the person with the arms raised is treated as a pure hieroglyphic and is placed between two rude caducei the lunar or solar symbol follows figure also from constantine shows the lastmentioned symbol above the figure with the arms raised is simply a hieroglyph and is placed between an arm and hand on the one side and a rude caduceus on the other figure shows the person holding a rude caduceus in the right hand and standing above a dolphin this latter as in the case of the horse in and is by far the best delineated figure this also being from constantine shows the usual human hieroglyph between a caduceus and a crescent figure is from the site of ancient carthage it is very rough in workmanship and the designs are mere scratchings on the stone the ensemble has the effect of an evil sigil figure is also from carthage and the various symbols appear to have become compressed into and synthesised in the form of a peculiarly evillooking caduceus figure is from the decoration of a sepulchral urn found at oldenburgh in germany it is remarkable as showing the same hieroglyphic human form with the crescent above the latter in the secret seal of solomon has a flattened top and is therefore more like a bowl and is placed across the hieroglyph figure is an egyptian design which would show an analogy between the symbol and the idea of the force of the creation figure is a stele from phnicia somewhat similar to the others except that the rudimentary caducei in figures and are here replaced by two roughly drawn ionic columns these last three designs are taken from the work of the chevalier emile soldicolbert de beaulieu on the langue sacre in figure is given the seal of the spirit halahel this spirit is said to be under the rule of bael and to be of a mixed nature partly good and partly evil like the spirits of theurgiagoetia which follow in the second book of the lemegeton the other magical requisites the other magical requisites are a sceptre a sword a mitre a cap a long white robe of linen and other garments for the purpose also a girdle of lions skin three inches broad with all the names written about it which be round the outmost part of the magical circle also perfumes and a chafingdish of charcoal kindled to put the fumes on to smoke or perfume the place appointed for action also anointing oil to anoint thy temples and thine eyes with and fair water to wash thyself in and in so doing thou shalt say as david said the adoration at the bath thou shalt purge me with hyssop o lord and i shall be clean thou shalt wash me and i shall be whiter than snow and at the putting on of thy garments thou shalt say the adoration at the induing of the vestments by the figurative mystery of these holy vestures or of this holy vestment i will clothe me with the armour of salvation in the strength of the most high anchor amacor amides theodinias anitor that my desired end may be effected through thy strength o adonai unto whom the praise and glory will for ever and ever belong amen after thou hast so done make prayers unto god according unto thy work as solomon hath commanded footnote in many codices it is written a sceptre or sword a mitre or cap by the other garments would be meant not only undergarments but also mantles of different colours the conjuration to call forth any of the aforesaid spirits i do invocate and conjure thee o spirit n and being with power armed from the supreme majesty i do strongly command thee by beralanensis baldachiensis paumachia and apologiae sedes by the most powerful princes genii liachid and ministers of the tartarean abode and by the chief prince of the seat of apologia in the ninth legion i do invoke thee and by invocating conjure thee and being armed with

accomplished and by all the names of god also by the names adonai el elohim elohi ehyeh asher ehyeh zabaoth elion iah tetragrammaton shaddai lord god most high i do exorcise thee and do powerfully command thee o thou spirit n that thou dost forthwith appear unto me here before this circle in a fair human shape without any deformity or tortuosity and by this ineffable name tetragrammaton iehovah do i command thee at the which being heard the elements are overthrown the air is shaken the sea runneth back the fire is quenched the earth trembleth and all the hosts of the celestials terrestrials and infernals do tremble together and are troubled and confounded wherefore come thou o spirit n forthwith and without delay from any or all parts of the world wherever thou mayest be and make rational answers unto all things that i shall demand of thee come thou peaceably visibly and affably now and without delay manifesting that which i shall desire for thou art conjured by the name of the living and true god helioren wherefore fulfil thou my commands and persist thou therein unto the end and according unto mine interest visibly and affably speaking unto me with a voice clear and intelligible without any ambiguity repeat this conjuration as often as thou pleasest and if the spirit come not yet say as followeth the second conjuration i do invocate conjure and command thee o thou spirit n to appear and to show thyself visibly unto me before this circle in fair and comely shape without any deformity or tortuosity by the name and in the name iah and vau which adam heard and spake and by the name of god agla which lot heard and was saved with his family and by the name ioth which jacob heard from the angel wrestling with him and was delivered from the hand of esau his brother and by the name anaphaxeton which aaron heard and spake and was made wise and by the name zabaoth which moses named and all the rivers were turned into blood and by the name asher ehyeh oriston which moses named and all the rivers brought forth frogs and they ascended into the houses destroying all things and by the name elion which moses named and there was great hail such as had not been since the beginning of the world and by the name adonai which moses named and there came up locusts which appeared upon the whole land and devoured all which the hail had left and by the name schema amathia which ioshua called upon and the sun stayed his course and by the name alpha and omega which daniel named and destroyed bel and slew the dragon and in the name emmanuel which the three children shadrach meshach and abednego sang in the midst of the fiery furnace and were delivered and by the name hagios and by the seal of adoni and by ischyros athanatos paracletos and by o theos ictros athanatos and by these three secret names agla on tetragrammaton do i adjure and constrain thee and by these names and by all the other names of the living and true god the lord almighty i do exorcise and command thee o spirit n even by him who spake the word and it was done and to whom all creatures are obedient and by the dreadful judgments of god and by the uncertain sea of glass which is before the divine majesty mighty and powerful by the four beasts before the throne having eyes before and behind by the fire round about the throne by the holy angels of heaven and by the mighty wisdom of god i do potently exorcise thee that thou appearest here before this circle to fulfil my will in all things which shall seem good unto me by the seal of basdathea baldachia and by this name primeumaton which moses named and the earth opened and did swallow up kora dathan and abiram wherefore thou shalt make faithful answers unto all my demands o spirit n and shalt perform all my desires so far as in thine office thou art capable hereof wherefore come thou visibly peaceably and affably now without delay to manifest that which i desire speaking with a clear and perfect voice intelligibly and to mine understanding if he come not yet at the rehearsal of these two first conjurations but without doubt he will say on as followeth it being a constraint the constraint i do conjure thee o thou spirit n by all the most glorious and efficacious names of the most great and incomprehensible lord god of hosts that thou comest quickly and without delay from all parts and places of the earth and world wherever thou mayest be to make rational answers unto my demands and that visibly and affably speaking with a voice intelligible unto mine understanding as aforesaid i conjure and constrain thee o thou spirit n by all the names aforesaid and in addition by these seven great names wherewith solomon the wise bound thee and thy companions in a vessel of brass adonai preyai or prerai tetragrammaton anaphaxeton or anepheneton inessenfatoal or inessenfatall pathtumon or pathatumon and itemon that thou appearest here before this circle to fulfil my will in all things that seem good unto me and if thou be still so disobedient and refusest still to come i will in the power and by the power of the name of the supreme and everlasting lord god who created both thee and me and all the world in six days and what is contained therein eie saraye and by the power of this name primeumaton which commandeth the whole host of heaven curse thee and deprive thee of thine office joy and place and bind thee in the depths of the bottomless pit or abyss there to remain unto the day of the last judgment and i will bind thee in the eternal fire and into the lake of flame and of brimstone unless thou comest quickly and appearest here before this circle to do my will therefore come thou in and by the holy names adonai zabaoth adonai amioran come thou for it is adonai who commandest thee if thou hast come thus far and yet he appeareth not thou mayest be sure that he is sent unto some other place by his king and cannot come and if it be so invocate the king as here followeth to send him but if he do not come still then thou mayest be sure that he is bound in chains in hell and that he is not in the custody of his king if so and thou still hast a desire to call him even from thence thou must rehearse the general curse which is called the spirits chain here followeth therefore the invocation of the king the invocation of the king o thou great powerful and mighty king amaimon who bearest rule by the power of the supreme god el over all spirits both superior and inferior of the infernal orders in the dominion of the east i do invocate and command thee by the especial and true name of god and by that god that thou worshippest and by the seal of thy creation and by the most mighty and powerful name of god iehovah tetragrammaton who cast thee out of heaven with all other infernal spirits and by all the most powerful and great names of god who created heaven and earth and hell and all things in them contained and by their power and virtue and by the name primeumaton who commandeth the whole host of heaven that thou mayest cause enforce and compel the spirit n to come unto me here before this circle in a fair and comely shape without harm unto me or unto any other creature to answer truly and faithfully unto all my requests so that i may accomplish my will and desire in knowing or obtaining any matter or thing which by office thou knowest is proper for him to perform or accomplish through the power of god el who created and doth dispose of all things both celestial arial terrestrial and infernal after thou shalt have invocated the king in this manner twice or thrice over then conjure the spirit thou wouldst call forth by the aforesaid conjurations rehearsing them several times together and he will come without doubt if not at the first or second time of rehearsing but if he do not come add the spirits chain unto the end of the aforesaid conjurations and he will be forced to come even if he be bound in chains for the chains must break off from him and he will be at liberty the general curse called the spirits chain against all spirits that rebel o thou wicked and disobedient spirit n because thou hast rebelled and hast not obeyed nor regarded my words which i have rehearsed they being all glorious and incomprehensible names of the true god the maker and creator of thee and of me and of all the world i do by the power of these names the which no creature is able to resist curse thee into the depth of the bottomless abyss there to remain unto the day of doom in chains and in fire and brimstone unquenchable unless thou forthwith appear here before this circle in this triangle to do my will and therefore come thou quickly and peaceably in and by these names of god adonai zabaoth adonai amioran come thou come thou for it is the king of kings even adonai who commandeth thee when thou shalt have rehearsed thus far but still he cometh not then write thou his seal on parchment and put thou it into a strong black box with brimstone assaftida and such like things that bear a stinking smell and then bind the box up round with an iron wire and hang it upon the point of thy sword and hold it over the fire of charcoal and say as followeth unto the fire first it being placed toward that quarter whence the spirit is to come the conjuration of the fire i conjure thee o fire by him who made thee and all other creatures for good in the world that thou torment burn and consume this spirit n for everlasting i condemn thee thou spirit n because thou art disobedient and obeyest not my commandment nor keepest the precepts of the lord thy god neither wilt thou obey me nor mine invocations having thereby called thee forth i who am the servant of the most high and imperial lord god of hosts iehovah i who am dignified and fortified by his celestial power and permission and yet thou comest not to answer these my propositions here made unto thee for the which thine averseness and contempt thou art guilty of great disobedience and rebellion and therefore shall i excommunicate thee and destroy thy name and seal the which i have enclosed in this box and shall burn thee in the immortal fire and bury thee in immortal oblivion unless thou immediately come and appear visibly and affably friendly and courteously here unto me before this circle in this triangle in a form comely and fair and in no wise terrible hurtful or frightful to me or any other creature whatsoever upon the face of earth and thou shalt make rational answers unto my requests and perform all my desires in all things that i shall make unto thee and if he come not even yet thou shalt say as followeth the greater curse now o thou spirit n since thou art still pernicious and disobedient and wilt not appear unto me to answer unto such things as i would have desired of thee or would have been satisfied in i do in the name and by the power and dignity of the omnipresent and immortal lord god of hosts iehovah tetragrammaton the only creator of heaven and earth and hell and all that is therein who is the marvellous disposer of all things both visible and invisible curse thee and deprive thee of all thine office joy and place and i do bind thee in the depths of the bottomless abyss there to remain until the day of judgment i say into the lake of fire and brimstone which is prepared for all rebellious disobedient obstinate and pernicious spirits let all the company of heaven curse thee let the sun moon and all the stars curse thee let the light and all the hosts of heaven curse thee into the fire unquenchable and into the torments unspeakable and as thy name and seal contained in this box chained and bound up shall be choken in sulphurous stinking substances and burned in this material fire so in the name iehovah and by the power and dignity of these three names tetragrammaton anaphaxeton and primeumaton i do cast thee o thou wicked and disobedient spirit n into the lake of fire which is prepared for the damnd and accursd spirits and there to remain unto the day of doom and never more to be remembered before the face of god who shall come to judge the quick and the dead and the world by fire then the exorcist must put the box into the fire and byandby the spirit will come but as soon as he is come quench the fire that the box is in and make a sweet perfume and give him welcome and a kind entertainment showing unto him the pentacle that is at the bottom of your vesture covered with a linen cloth saying the address unto the spirit upon his coming behold thy confusion if thou refusest to be obedient behold the pentacle of solomon which i have brought here before thy presence behold the person of the exorcist in the midst of the exorcism him who is armd by god and without fear him who potently invocateth thee and calleth thee forth unto appearance even him thy master who is called octinimos wherefore make rational answer unto my demands and prepare to be obedient unto thy master in the name of the lord bathal or vathat rushing upon abrac abeor coming upon aberer then he or they will be obedient and bid thee ask what thou wilt for he or they be subjected by god to fulfil our desires and commands and when he or they shall have appeared and showed himself or themselves humble and meek then shalt thou rehearse the welcome unto the spirit welcome spirit n o most noble king or kings i say thou art welcome unto me because i have called thee through him who has created heaven and earth and hell and all that is in them contained and because also thou hast obeyed by that same power by the which i have called thee forth i bind thee that thou remain affably and visibly here before this circle or before this circle and in this triangle so constant and so long as i shall have occasion for thy presence and not to depart without my license until thou hast duly and faithfully performed my will without any falsity then standing in the midst of the circle thou shall stretch forth thine hand in a gesture of command and say by the pentacle of solomon have i called thee give unto me a true answer then let the exorcist state his desires and requests and when the evocation is finished thou shalt license the spirit to depart thus the license to depart o thou spirit n because thou hast diligently answered unto my demands and hast been very ready and willing to come at my call i do here license thee to depart unto thy proper place without causing harm or danger unto man or beast depart then i say and be thou very ready to come at my call being duly exorcised and conjured by the sacred rites of magic i charge thee to withdraw peaceably and quietly and the peace of god be ever continued between thee and me amen after thou hast given the spirit license to depart thou art not to go out of the circle until he or they be gone and until thou shalt have made prayers and rendered thanks unto god for the great blessings he hath bestowed upon thee in granting thy desires and delivering thee from all the malice of the enemy the devil also note thou mayest command these spirits into the vessel of brass in the same manner as thou dost into the triangle by saying that thou dost forthwith appear before this circle in this vessel of brass in a fair and comely shape etc as hath been shown in the foregoing conjurations footnote here interpolate the name of the spirit desired to be invocated in some of the codices there are faint variations in the form of wording of the conjurations but not sufficient to change the sense e g tartarean abode for tartarean seat etc footnote in some by the seat of adonai or by the throne of adonai in these conjurations and elsewhere in the body of the text i have given the divine names correctly footnote it will depend on the quarter to which the spirit is attributed which of the four chief kings are to be invoked footnote this box should evidently be in metal or in something which does not take fire easily footnote in some codices this is called the curse only but in one or two the spirits chain is called the lesser curse and this the greater curse footnote in the latin bathal vel vathat super abrac ruens abeor
