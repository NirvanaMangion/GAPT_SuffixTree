publishers toronto copyright canada by mcclelland stewart limited publishers toronto first printing october second july third december fourth december fifth march printed in canada to her hand in hand we come christopher robin and i to lay this book in your lap say youre surprised say you like it say its just what you wanted because its yours because we love you introduction if you happen to have read another book about christopher robin you may remember that he once had a swan or the swan had christopher robin i dont know which and that he used to call this swan pooh that was a long time ago and when we said goodbye we took the name with us as we didnt think the swan would want it any more well when edward bear said that he would like an exciting name all to himself christopher robin said at once without stopping to think that he was winniethepooh and he was so as i have explained the pooh part i will now explain the rest of it you cant be in london for long without going to the zoo there are some people who begin the zoo at the beginning called wayin and walk as quickly as they can past every cage until they get to the one called wayout but the nicest people go straight to the animal they love the most and stay there so when christopher robin goes to the zoo he goes to where the polar bears are and he whispers something to the third keeper from the left and doors are unlocked and we wander through dark passages and up steep stairs until at last we come to the special cage and the cage is opened and out trots something brown and furry and with a happy cry of oh bear christopher robin rushes into its arms now this bears name is winnie which shows what a good name for bears it is but the funny thing is that we cant remember whether winnie is called after pooh or pooh after winnie we did know once but we have forgotten i had written as far as this when piglet looked up and said in his squeaky voice what about me my dear piglet i said the whole book is about you so it is about pooh he squeaked you see what it is he is jealous because he thinks pooh is having a grand introduction all to himself pooh is the favourite of course theres no denying it but piglet comes in for a good many things which pooh misses because you cant take pooh to school without everybody knowing it but piglet is so small that he slips into a pocket where it is very comforting to feel him when you are not quite sure whether twice seven is twelve or twentytwo sometimes he slips out and has a good look in the inkpot and in this way he has got more education than pooh but pooh doesnt mind some have brains and some havent he says and there it is and now all the others are saying what about us so perhaps the best thing to do is to stop writing introductions and get on with the book a a m contents i in which we are introduced to winniethepooh and some bees and the stories begin ii in which pooh goes visiting and gets into a tight place iii in which pooh and piglet go hunting and nearly catch a woozle iv in which eeyore loses a tail and pooh finds one v in which piglet meets a heffalump vi in which eeyore has a birthday and gets two presents vii in which kanga and baby roo come to the forest and piglet has a bath viii in which christopher robin leads an expotition to the north pole ix in which piglet is entirely surrounded by water x in which christopher robin gives a pooh party and we say goodbye winniethepooh chapter i in which we are introduced to winniethepooh and some bees and the stories begin here is edward bear coming downstairs now bump bump bump on the back of his head behind christopher robin it is as far as he knows the only way of coming downstairs but sometimes he feels that there really is another way if only he could stop bumping for a moment and think of it and then he feels that perhaps there isnt anyhow here he is at the bottom and ready to be introduced to you winniethepooh when i first heard his name i said just as you are going to say but i thought he was a boy so did i said christopher robin then you cant call him winnie i dont but you said hes winnietherpooh dont you know what ther means ah yes now i do i said quickly and i hope you do too because it is all the explanation you are going to get sometimes winniethepooh likes a game of some sort when he comes downstairs and sometimes he likes to sit quietly in front of the fire and listen to a story this evening what about a story said christopher robin what about a story i said could you very sweetly tell winniethepooh one i suppose i could i said what sort of stories does he like about himself because hes that sort of bear oh i see so could you very sweetly ill try i said so i tried once upon a time a very long time ago now about last friday winniethepooh lived in a forest all by himself under the name of sanders what does under the name mean asked christopher robin it means he had the name over the door in gold letters and lived under it winniethepooh wasnt quite sure said christopher robin now i am said a growly voice then i will go on said i one day when he was out walking he came to an open place in the middle of the forest and in the middle of this place was a large oaktree and from the top of the tree there came a loud buzzingnoise winniethepooh sat down at the foot of the tree put his head between his paws and began to think first of all he said to himself that buzzingnoise means something you dont get a buzzingnoise like that just buzzing and buzzing without its meaning something if theres a buzzingnoise somebodys making a buzzingnoise and the only reason for making a buzzingnoise that i know of is because youre a bee then he thought another long time and said and the only reason for being a bee that i know of is making honey and then he got up and said and the only reason for making honey is so as i can eat it so he began to climb the tree he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and as he climbed he sang a little song to himself it went like this isnt it funny how a bear likes honey buzz buzz buzz i wonder why he does then he climbed a little further and a little further and then just a little further by that time he had thought of another song its a very funny thought that if bears were bees theyd build their nests at the bottom of trees and that being so if the bees were bears we shouldnt have to climb up all these stairs he was getting rather tired by this time so that is why he sang a complaining song he was nearly there now and if he just stood on that branch crack oh help said pooh as he dropped ten feet on the branch below him if only i hadnt he said as he bounced twenty feet on to the next branch you see what i meant to do he explained as he turned headoverheels and crashed on to another branch thirty feet below what i meant to do of course it was rather he admitted as he slithered very quickly through the next six branches it all comes i suppose he decided as he said goodbye to the last branch spun round three times and flew gracefully into a gorsebush it all comes of liking honey so much oh help he crawled out of the gorsebush brushed the prickles from his nose and began to think again and the first person he thought of was christopher robin was that me said christopher robin in an awed voice hardly daring to believe it that was you christopher robin said nothing but his eyes got larger and larger and his face got pinker and pinker so winniethepooh went round to his friend christopher robin who lived behind a green door in another part of the forest good morning christopher robin he said good morning winnietherpooh said you i wonder if youve got such a thing as a balloon about you a balloon yes i just said to myself coming along i wonder if christopher robin has such a thing as a balloon about him i just said it to myself thinking of balloons and wondering what do you want a balloon for you said winniethepooh looked round to see that nobody was listening put his paw to his mouth and said in a deep whisper honey but you dont get honey with balloons i do said pooh well it just happened that you had been to a party the day before at the house of your friend piglet and you had balloons at the party you had had a big green balloon and one of rabbits relations had had a big blue one and had left it behind being really too young to go to a party at all and so you had brought the green one and the blue one home with you which one would you like you asked pooh he put his head between his paws and thought very carefully its like this he said when you go after honey with a balloon the great thing is not to let the bees know youre coming now if you have a green balloon they might think you were only part of the tree and not notice you and if you have a blue balloon they might think you were only part of the sky and not notice you and the question is which is most likely wouldnt they notice you underneath the balloon you asked they might or they might not said winniethepooh you never can tell with bees he thought for a moment and said i shall try to look like a small black cloud that will deceive them then you had better have the blue balloon you said and so it was decided well you both went out with the blue balloon and you took your gun with you just in case as you always did and winniethepooh went to a very muddy place that he knew of and rolled and rolled until he was black all over and then when the balloon was blown up as big as big and you and pooh were both holding on to the string you let go suddenly and pooh bear floated gracefully up into the sky and stayed therelevel with the top of the tree and about twenty feet away from it hooray you shouted isnt that fine shouted winniethepooh down to you what do i look like you look like a bear holding on to a balloon you said not said pooh anxiously not like a small black cloud in a blue sky not very much ah well perhaps from up here it looks different and as i say you never can tell with bees there was no wind to blow him nearer to the tree so there he stayed he could see the honey he could smell the honey but he couldnt quite reach the honey after a little while he called down to you christopher robin he said in a loud whisper hallo i think the bees suspect something what sort of thing i dont know but something tells me that theyre suspicious perhaps they think that youre after their honey it may be that you never can tell with bees there was another little silence and then he called down to you again christopher robin yes have you an umbrella in your house i think so i wish you would bring it out here and walk up and down with it and look up at me every now and then and say tuttut it looks like rain i think if you did that it would help the deception which we are practising on these bees well you laughed to yourself silly old bear but you didnt say it aloud because you were so fond of him and you went home for your umbrella oh there you are called down winniethepooh as soon as you got back to the tree i was beginning to get anxious i have discovered that the bees are now definitely suspicious shall i put my umbrella up you said yes but wait a moment we must be practical the important bee to deceive is the queen bee can you see which is the queen bee from down there no a pity well now if you walk up and down with your umbrella saying tuttut it looks like rain i shall do what i can by singing a little cloud song such as a cloud might sing go so while you walked up and down and wondered if it would rain winniethepooh sang this song how sweet to be a cloud floating in the blue every little cloud always sings aloud how sweet to be a cloud floating in the blue it makes him very proud to be a little cloud the bees were still buzzing as suspiciously as ever some of them indeed left their nests and flew all round the cloud as it began the second verse of this song and one bee sat down on the nose of the cloud for a moment and then got up again christopherowrobin called out the cloud yes i have just been thinking and i have come to a very important decision these are the wrong sort of bees are they quite the wrong sort so i should think they would make the wrong sort of honey shouldnt you would they yes so i think i shall come down how asked you winniethepooh hadnt thought about this if he let go of the string he would fallbumpand he didnt like the idea of that so he thought for a long time and then he said christopher robin you must shoot the balloon with your gun have you got your gun of course i have you said but if i do that it will spoil the balloon you said but if you dont said pooh i shall have to let go and that would spoil me when he put it like this you saw how it was and you aimed very carefully at the balloon and fired ow said pooh did i miss you asked you didnt exactly miss said pooh but you missed the balloon im so sorry you said and you fired again and this time you hit the balloon and the air came slowly out and winniethepooh floated down to the ground but his arms were so stiff from holding on to the string of the balloon all that time that they stayed up straight in the air for more than a week and whenever a fly came and settled on his nose he had to blow it off and i thinkbut i am not surethat that is why he was always called pooh is that the end of the story asked christopher robin thats the end of that one there are others about pooh and me and piglet and rabbit and all of you dont you remember i do remember and then when i try to remember i forget that day when pooh and piglet tried to catch the heffalump they didnt catch it did they no pooh couldnt because he hasnt any brain did i catch it well that comes into the story christopher robin nodded i do remember he said only pooh doesnt very well so thats why he likes having it told to him again because then its a real story and not just a remembering thats just how i feel i said christopher robin gave a deep sigh picked his bear up by the leg and walked off to the door trailing pooh behind him at the door he turned and said coming to see me have my bath i might i said i didnt hurt him when i shot him did i not a bit he nodded and went out and in a moment i heard winniethepoohbump bump bumpgoing up the stairs behind him chapter ii in which pooh goes visiting and gets into a tight place edward bear known to his friends as winniethepooh or pooh for short was walking through the forest one day humming proudly to himself he had made up a little hum that very morning as he was doing his stoutness exercises in front of the glass tralala tralala as he stretched up as high as he could go and then tralala tralaoh helpla as he tried to reach his toes after breakfast he had said it over and over to himself until he had learnt it off by heart and now he was humming it right through properly it went like this tralala tralala tralala tralala rumtumtiddleumtum tiddleiddle tiddleiddle tiddleiddle tiddleiddle rumtumtumtiddleum well he was humming this hum to himself and walking along gaily wondering what everybody else was doing and what it felt like being somebody else when suddenly he came to a sandy bank and in the bank was a large hole aha said pooh rumtumtiddleumtum if i know anything about anything that hole means rabbit he said and rabbit means company he said and company means food and listeningtomehumming and such like rumtumtumtiddleum so he bent down put his head into the hole and called out is anybody at home there was a sudden scuffling noise from inside the hole and then silence what i said was is anybody at home called out pooh very loudly no said a voice and then added you neednt shout so loud i heard you quite well the first time bother said pooh isnt there anybody here at all nobody winniethepooh took his head out of the hole and thought for a little and he thought to himself there must be somebody there because somebody must have said nobody so he put his head back in the hole and said hallo rabbit isnt that you no said rabbit in a different sort of voice this time but isnt that rabbits voice i dont think so said rabbit it isnt meant to be oh said pooh he took his head out of the hole and had another think and then he put it back and said well could you very kindly tell me where rabbit is he has gone to see his friend pooh bear who is a great friend of his but this is me said bear very much surprised what sort of me pooh bear are you sure said rabbit still more surprised quite quite sure said pooh oh well then come in so pooh pushed and pushed and pushed his way through the hole and at last he got in you were quite right said rabbit looking at him all over it is you glad to see you who did you think it was well i wasnt sure you know how it is in the forest one cant have anybody coming into ones house one has to be careful what about a mouthful of something pooh always liked a little something at eleven oclock in the morning and he was very glad to see rabbit getting out the plates and mugs and when rabbit said honey or condensed milk with your bread he was so excited that he said both and then so as not to seem greedy he added but dont bother about the bread please and for a long time after that he said nothing until at last humming to himself in a rather sticky voice he got up shook rabbit lovingly by the paw and said that he must be going on must you said rabbit politely well said pooh i could stay a little longer if itif you and he tried very hard to look in the direction of the larder as a matter of fact said rabbit i was going out myself directly oh well then ill be going on goodbye well goodbye if youre sure you wont have any more is there any more asked pooh quickly rabbit took the covers off the dishes and said no there wasnt i thought not said pooh nodding to himself well goodbye i must be going on so he started to climb out of the hole he pulled with his front paws and pushed with his back paws and in a little while his nose was out in the open again and then his ears and then his front paws and then his shoulders and then oh help said pooh id better go back oh bother said pooh i shall have to go on i cant do either said pooh oh help and bother now by this time rabbit wanted to go for a walk too and finding the front door full he went out by the back door and came round to pooh and looked at him hallo are you stuck he asked nno said pooh carelessly just resting and thinking and humming to myself here give us a paw pooh bear stretched out a paw and rabbit pulled and pulled and pulled ow cried pooh youre hurting the fact is said rabbit youre stuck it all comes said pooh crossly of not having front doors big enough it all comes said rabbit sternly of eating too much i thought at the time said rabbit only i didnt like to say anything said rabbit that one of us was eating too much said rabbit and i knew if wasnt me he said well well i shall go and fetch christopher robin christopher robin lived at the other end of the forest and when he came back with rabbit and saw the front half of pooh he said silly old bear in such a loving voice that everybody felt quite hopeful again i was just beginning to think said bear sniffing slightly that rabbit might never be able to use his front door again and i should hate that he said so should i said rabbit use his front door again said christopher robin of course hell use his front door again good said rabbit if we cant pull you out pooh we might push you back rabbit scratched his whiskers thoughtfully and pointed out that when once pooh was pushed back he was back and of course nobody was more glad to see pooh than he was still there it was some lived in trees and some lived underground and you mean id never get out said pooh i mean said rabbit that having got so far it seems a pity to waste it christopher robin nodded then theres only one thing to be done he said we shall have to wait for you to get thin again how long does getting thin take asked pooh anxiously about a week i should think but i cant stay here for a week you can stay here all right silly old bear its getting you out which is so difficult well read to you said rabbit cheerfully and i hope it wont snow he added and i say old fellow youre taking up a good deal of room in my housedo you mind if i use your back legs as a towelhorse because i mean there they aredoing nothingand it would be very convenient just to hang the towels on them a week said pooh gloomily what about meals im afraid no meals said christopher robin because of getting thin quicker but we will read to you bear began to sigh and then found he couldnt because he was so tightly stuck and a tear rolled down his eye as he said then would you read a sustaining book such as would help and comfort a wedged bear in great tightness so for a week christopher robin read that sort of book at the north end of pooh and rabbit hung his washing on the south end and in between bear felt himself getting slenderer and slenderer and at the end of the week christopher robin said now so he took hold of poohs front paws and rabbit took hold of christopher robin and all rabbits friends and relations took hold of rabbit and they all pulled together and for a long time pooh only said ow and oh and then all of a sudden he said pop just as if a cork were coming out of a bottle and christopher robin and rabbit and all rabbits friends and relations went headoverheels backwards and on the top of them came winniethepoohfree so with a nod of thanks to his friends he went on with his walk through the forest humming proudly to himself but christopher robin looked after him lovingly and said to himself silly old bear chapter iii in which pooh and piglet go hunting and nearly catch a woozle the piglet lived in a very grand house in the middle of a beechtree and the beechtree was in the middle of the forest and the piglet lived in the middle of the house next to his house was a piece of broken board which had trespassers w on it when christopher robin asked the piglet what it meant he said it was his grandfathers name and had been in the family for a long time christopher robin said you couldnt be called trespassers w and piglet said yes you could because his grandfather was and it was short for trespassers will which was short for trespassers william and his grandfather had had two names in case he lost onetrespassers after an uncle and william after trespassers ive got two names said christopher robin carelessly well there you are that proves it said piglet one fine winters day when piglet was brushing away the snow in front of his house he happened to look up and there was winniethepooh pooh was walking round and round in a circle thinking of something else and when piglet called to him he just went on walking hallo said piglet what are you doing hunting said pooh hunting what tracking something said winniethepooh very mysteriously tracking what said piglet coming closer thats just what i ask myself i ask myself what what do you think youll answer i shall have to wait until i catch up with it said winniethepooh now look there he pointed to the ground in front of him what do you see there tracks said piglet pawmarks he gave a little squeak of excitement oh pooh do you think its aaa woozle it may be said pooh sometimes it is and sometimes it isnt you never can tell with pawmarks with these few words he went on tracking and piglet after watching him for a minute or two ran after him winniethepooh had come to a sudden stop and was bending over the tracks in a puzzled sort of way whats the matter asked piglet its a very funny thing said bear but there seem to be two animals now thiswhateveritwashas been joined by anotherwhateveritisand the two of them are now proceeding in company would you mind coming with me piglet in case they turn out to be hostile animals piglet scratched his ear in a nice sort of way and said that he had nothing to do until friday and would be delighted to come in case it really was a woozle you mean in case it really is two woozles said winniethepooh and piglet said that anyhow he had nothing to do until friday so off they went together there was a small spinney of larch trees just here and it seemed as if the two woozles if that is what they were had been going round this spinney so round this spinney went pooh and piglet after them piglet passing the time by telling pooh what his grandfather trespassers w had done to remove stiffness after tracking and how his grandfather trespassers w had suffered in his later years from shortness of breath and other matters of interest and pooh wondering what a grandfather was like and if perhaps this was two grandfathers they were after now and if so whether he would be allowed to take one home and keep it and what christopher robin would say and still the tracks went on in front of them suddenly winniethepooh stopped and pointed excitedly in front of him look what said piglet with a jump and then to show that he hadnt been frightened he jumped up and down once or twice more in an exercising sort of way the tracks said pooh a third animal has joined the other two pooh cried piglet do you think it is another woozle no said pooh because it makes different marks it is either two woozles and one as it might be wizzle or two as it might be wizzles and one if so it is woozle let us continue to follow them so they went on feeling just a little anxious now in case the three animals in front of them were of hostile intent and piglet wished very much that his grandfather t w were there instead of elsewhere and pooh thought how nice it would be if they met christopher robin suddenly but quite accidentally and only because he liked christopher robin so much and then all of a sudden winniethepooh stopped again and licked the tip of his nose in a cooling manner for he was feeling more hot and anxious than ever in his life before there were four animals in front of them do you see piglet look at their tracks three as it were woozles and one as it was wizzle another woozle has joined them and so it seemed to be there were the tracks crossing over each other here getting muddled up with each other there but quite plainly every now and then the tracks of four sets of paws i think said piglet when he had licked the tip of his nose too and found that it brought very little comfort i think that i have just remembered something i have just remembered something that i forgot to do yesterday and shant be able to do tomorrow so i suppose i really ought to go back and do it now well do it this afternoon and ill come with you said pooh it isnt the sort of thing you can do in the afternoon said piglet quickly its a very particular morning thing that has to be done in the morning and if possible between the hours ofwhat would you say the time was about twelve said winniethepooh looking at the sun between as i was saying the hours of twelve and twelve five so really dear old pooh if youll excuse mewhats that pooh looked up at the sky and then as he heard the whistle again he looked up into the branches of a big oaktree and then he saw a friend of his its christopher robin he said ah then youll be all right said piglet youll be quite safe with him goodbye and he trotted off home as quickly as he could very glad to be out of all danger again christopher robin came slowly down his tree silly old bear he said what were you doing first you went round the spinney twice by yourself and then piglet ran after you and you went round again together and then you were just going round a fourth time wait a moment said winniethepooh holding up his paw he sat down and thought in the most thoughtful way he could think then he fitted his paw into one of the tracks and then he scratched his nose twice and stood up yes said winniethepooh i see now said winniethepooh i have been foolish and deluded said he and i am a bear of no brain at all youre the best bear in all the world said christopher robin soothingly am i said pooh hopefully and then he brightened up suddenly anyhow he said it is nearly luncheon time so he went home for it chapter iv in which eeyore loses a tail and pooh finds one the old grey donkey eeyore stood by himself in a thistly corner of the forest his front feet well apart his head on one side and thought about things sometimes he thought sadly to himself why and sometimes he thought wherefore and sometimes he thought inasmuch as whichand sometimes he didnt quite know what he was thinking about so when winniethepooh came stumping along eeyore was very glad to be able to stop thinking for a little in order to say how do you do in a gloomy manner to him and how are you said winniethepooh eeyore shook his head from side to side not very how he said i dont seem to have felt at all how for a long time dear dear said pooh im sorry about that lets have a look at you so eeyore stood there gazing sadly at the ground and winniethepooh walked all round him once why whats happened to your tail he said in surprise what has happened to it said eeyore it isnt there are you sure well either a tail is there or it isnt there you cant make a mistake about it and yours isnt there then what is nothing lets have a look said eeyore and he turned slowly round to the place where his tail had been a little while ago and then finding that he couldnt catch it up he turned round the other way until he came back to where he was at first and then he put his head down and looked between his front legs and at last he said with a long sad sigh i believe youre right of course im right said pooh that accounts for a good deal said eeyore gloomily it explains everything no wonder you must have left it somewhere said winniethepooh somebody must have taken it said eeyore how like them he added after a long silence pooh felt that he ought to say something helpful about it but didnt quite know what so he decided to do something helpful instead eeyore he said solemnly i winniethepooh will find your tail for you thank you pooh answered eeyore youre a real friend said he not like some he said so winniethepooh went off to find eeyores tail it was a fine spring morning in the forest as he started out little soft clouds played happily in a blue sky skipping from time to time in front of the sun as if they had come to put it out and then sliding away suddenly so that the next might have his turn through them and between them the sun shone bravely and a copse which had worn its firs all the year round seemed old and dowdy now beside the new green lace which the beeches had put on so prettily through copse and spinney marched bear down open slopes of gorse and heather over rocky beds of streams up steep banks of sandstone into the heather again and so at last tired and hungry to the hundred acre wood for it was in the hundred acre wood that owl lived and if anyone knows anything about anything said bear to himself its owl who knows something about something he said or my names not winniethepooh he said which it is he added so there you are owl lived at the chestnuts an oldworld residence of great charm which was grander than anybody elses or seemed so to bear because it had both a knocker and a bellpull underneath the knocker there was a notice which said ples ring if an rnser is reqird underneath the bellpull there was a notice which said plez cnoke if an rnsr is not reqid these notices had been written by christopher robin who was the only one in the forest who could spell for owl wise though he was in many ways able to read and write and spell his own name wol yet somehow went all to pieces over delicate words like measles and butteredtoast winniethepooh read the two notices very carefully first from left to right and afterwards in case he had missed some of it from right to left then to make quite sure he knocked and pulled the knocker and he pulled and knocked the bellrope and he called out in a very loud voice owl i require an answer its bear speaking and the door opened and owl looked out hallo pooh he said hows things terrible and sad said pooh because eeyore who is a friend of mine has lost his tail and hes moping about it so could you very kindly tell me how to find it for him well said owl the customary procedure in such cases is as follows what does crustimoney proseedcake mean said pooh for i am a bear of very little brain and long words bother me it means the thing to do as long as it means that i dont mind said pooh humbly the thing to do is as follows first issue a reward then just a moment said pooh holding up his paw what do we do to thiswhat you were saying you sneezed just as you were going to tell me i didnt sneeze yes you did owl excuse me pooh i didnt you cant sneeze without knowing it well you cant know it without something having been sneezed what i said was first issue a reward youre doing it again said pooh sadly a reward said owl very loudly we write a notice to say that we will give a large something to anybody who finds eeyores tail i see i see said pooh nodding his head talking about large somethings he went on dreamily i generally have a small something about nowabout this time in the morning and he looked wistfully at the cupboard in the corner of owls parlour just a mouthful of condensed milk or whatnot with perhaps a lick of honey well then said owl we write out this notice and we put it up all over the forest a lick of honey murmured bear to himself oror not as the case may be and he gave a deep sigh and tried very hard to listen to what owl was saying but owl went on and on using longer and longer words until at last he came back to where he started and he explained that the person to write out this notice was christopher robin it was he who wrote the ones on my front door for me did you see them pooh for some time now pooh had been saying yes and no in turn with his eyes shut to all that owl was saying and having said yes yes last time he said no not at all now without really knowing what owl was talking about didnt you see them said owl a little surprised come and look at them now so they went outside and pooh looked at the knocker and the notice below it and he looked at the bellrope and the notice below it and the more he looked at the bellrope the more he felt that he had seen something like it somewhere else sometime before handsome bellrope isnt it said owl pooh nodded it reminds me of something he said but i cant think what where did you get it i just came across it in the forest it was hanging over a bush and i thought at first somebody lived there so i rang it and nothing happened and then i rang it again very loudly and it came off in my hand and as nobody seemed to want it i took it home and owl said pooh solemnly you made a mistake somebody did want it who eeyore my dear friend eeyore he washe was fond of it fond of it attached to it said winniethepooh sadly so with these words he unhooked it and carried it back to eeyore and when christopher robin had nailed it on in its right place again eeyore frisked about the forest waving his tail so happily that winniethepooh came over all funny and had to hurry home for a little snack of something to sustain him and wiping his mouth half an hour afterwards he sang to himself proudly who found the tail i said pooh at a quarter to two only it was quarter to eleven really i found the tail chapter v in which piglet meets a heffalump one day when christopher robin and winniethepooh and piglet were all talking together christopher robin finished the mouthful he was eating and said carelessly i saw a heffalump today piglet what was it doing asked piglet just lumping along said christopher robin i dont think it saw me i saw one once said piglet at least i think i did he said only perhaps it wasnt so did i said pooh wondering what a heffalump was like you dont often see them said christopher robin carelessly not now said piglet not at this time of year said pooh then they all talked about something else until it was time for pooh and piglet to go home together at first as they stumped along the path which edged the hundred acre wood they didnt say much to each other but when they came to the stream and had helped each other across the stepping stones and were able to walk side by side again over the heather they began to talk in a friendly way about this and that and piglet said if you see what i mean pooh and pooh said its just what i think myself piglet and piglet said but on the other hand pooh we must remember and pooh said quite true piglet although i had forgotten it for the moment and then just as they came to the six pine trees pooh looked round to see that nobody else was listening and said in a very solemn voice piglet i have decided something what have you decided pooh i have decided to catch a heffalump pooh nodded his head several times as he said this and waited for piglet to say how or pooh you couldnt or something helpful of that sort but piglet said nothing the fact was piglet was wishing that he had thought about it first i shall do it said pooh after waiting a little longer by means of a trap and it must be a cunning trap so you will have to help me piglet pooh said piglet feeling quite happy again now i will and then he said how shall we do it and pooh said thats just it how and then they sat down together to think it out poohs first idea was that they should dig a very deep pit and then the heffalump would come along and fall into the pit and why said piglet why what said pooh why would he fall in pooh rubbed his nose with his paw and said that the heffalump might be walking along humming a little song and looking up at the sky wondering if it would rain and so he wouldnt see the very deep pit until he was halfway down when it would be too late piglet said that this was a very good trap but supposing it were raining already pooh rubbed his nose again and said that he hadnt thought of that and then he brightened up and said that if it were raining already the heffalump would be looking at the sky wondering if it would clear up and so he wouldnt see the very deep pit until he was halfway down when it would be too late piglet said that now that this point had been explained he thought it was a cunning trap pooh was very proud when he heard this and he felt that the heffalump was as good as caught already but there was just one other thing which had to be thought about and it was this where should they dig the very deep pit piglet said that the best place would be somewhere where a heffalump was just before he fell into it only about a foot farther on but then he would see us digging it said pooh not if he was looking at the sky he would suspect said pooh if he happened to look down he thought for a long time and then added sadly it isnt as easy as i thought i suppose thats why heffalumps hardly ever get caught that must be it said piglet they sighed and got up and when they had taken a few gorse prickles out of themselves they sat down again and all the time pooh was saying to himself if only i could think of something for he felt sure that a very clever brain could catch a heffalump if only he knew the right way to go about it suppose he said to piglet you wanted to catch me how would you do it well said piglet i should do it like this i should make a trap and i should put a jar of honey in the trap and you would smell it and you would go in after it and and i would go in after it said pooh excitedly only very carefully so as not to hurt myself and i would get to the jar of honey and i should lick round the edges first of all pretending that there wasnt any more you know and then i should walk away and think about it a little and then i should come back and start licking in the middle of the jar and then yes well never mind about that there you would be and there i should catch you now the first thing to think of is what do heffalumps like i should think acorns shouldnt you well get a lot ofi say wake up pooh pooh who had gone into a happy dream woke up with a start and said that honey was a much more trappy thing than haycorns piglet didnt think so and they were just going to argue about it when piglet remembered that if they put acorns in the trap he would have to find the acorns but if they put honey then pooh would have to give up some of his own honey so he said all right honey then just as pooh remembered it too and was going to say all right haycorns honey said piglet to himself in a thoughtful way as if it were now settled ill dig the pit while you go and get the honey very well said pooh and he stumped off as soon as he got home he went to the larder and he stood on a chair and took down a very large jar of honey from the top shelf it had hunny written on it but just to make sure he took off the paper cover and looked at it and it looked just like honey but you never can tell said pooh i remember my uncle saying once that he had seen cheese just this colour so he put his tongue in and took a large lick yes he said it is no doubt about that and honey i should say right down to the bottom of the jar unless of course he said somebody put cheese in at the bottom just for a joke perhaps i had better go a little further just in case in case heffalumps dont like cheese same as me ah and he gave a deep sigh i was right it is honey right the way down having made certain of this he took the jar back to piglet and piglet looked up from the bottom of his very deep pit and said got it and pooh said yes but it isnt quite a full jar and he threw it down to piglet and piglet said no it isnt is that all youve got left and pooh said yes because it was so piglet put the jar at the bottom of the pit and climbed out and they went off home together well good night pooh said piglet when they had got to poohs house and we meet at six oclock tomorrow morning by the pine trees and see how many heffalumps weve got in our trap six oclock piglet and have you got any string no why do you want string to lead them home with oh i think heffalumps come if you whistle some do and some dont you never can tell with heffalumps well good night good night and off piglet trotted to his house trespassers w while pooh made his preparations for bed some hours later just as the night was beginning to steal away pooh woke up suddenly with a sinking feeling he had had that sinking feeling before and he knew what it meant he was hungry so he went to the larder and he stood on a chair and reached up to the top shelf and foundnothing thats funny he thought i know i had a jar of honey there a full jar full of honey right up to the top and it had hunny written on it so that i should know it was honey thats very funny and then he began to wander up and down wondering where it was and murmuring a murmur to himself like this its very very funny cos i know i had some honey cos it had a label on saying hunny a goloptious fullup pot too and i dont know where its got to no i dont know where its gone well its funny he had murmured this to himself three times in a singing sort of way when suddenly he remembered he had put it into the cunning trap to catch the heffalump bother said pooh it all comes of trying to be kind to heffalumps and he got back into bed but he couldnt sleep the more he tried to sleep the more he couldnt he tried counting sheep which is sometimes a good way of getting to sleep and as that was no good he tried counting heffalumps and that was worse because every heffalump that he counted was making straight for a pot of poohs honey and eating it all for some minutes he lay there miserably but when the five hundred and eightyseventh heffalump was licking its jaws and saying to itself very good honey this i dont know when ive tasted better pooh could bear it no longer he jumped out of bed he ran out of the house and he ran straight to the six pine trees the sun was still in bed but there was a lightness in the sky over the hundred acre wood which seemed to show that it was waking up and would soon be kicking off the clothes in the halflight the pine trees looked cold and lonely and the very deep pit seemed deeper than it was and poohs jar of honey at the bottom was something mysterious a shape and no more but as he got nearer to it his nose told him that it was indeed honey and his tongue came out and began to polish up his mouth ready for it bother said pooh as he got his nose inside the jar a heffalump has been eating it and then he thought a little and said oh no i did i forgot indeed he had eaten most of it but there was a little left at the very bottom of the jar and he pushed his head right in and began to lick by and by piglet woke up as soon as he woke he said to himself oh then he said bravely yes and then still more bravely quite so but he didnt feel very brave for the word which was really jiggeting about in his brain was heffalumps what was a heffalump like was it fierce did it come when you whistled and how did it come was it fond of pigs at all if it was fond of pigs did it make any difference what sort of pig supposing it was fierce with pigs would it make any difference if the pig had a grandfather called trespassers william he didnt know the answer to any of these questions and he was going to see his first heffalump in about an hour from now of course pooh would be with him and it was much more friendly with two but suppose heffalumps were very fierce with pigs and bears wouldnt it be better to pretend that he had a headache and couldnt go up to the six pine trees this morning but then suppose that it was a very fine day and there was no heffalump in the trap here he would be in bed all the morning simply wasting his time for nothing what should he do and then he had a clever idea he would go up very quietly to the six pine trees now peep very cautiously into the trap and see if there was a heffalump there and if there was he would go back to bed and if there wasnt he wouldnt so off he went at first he thought that there wouldnt be a heffalump in the trap and then he thought that there would and as he got nearer he was sure that there would because he could hear it heffalumping about it like anything oh dear oh dear oh dear said piglet to himself and he wanted to run away but somehow having got so near he felt that he must just see what a heffalump was like so he crept to the side of the trap and looked in and all the time winniethepooh had been trying to get the honeyjar off his head the more he shook it the more tightly it stuck bother he said inside the jar and oh help and mostly ow and he tried bumping it against things but as he couldnt see what he was bumping it against it didnt help him and he tried to climb out of the trap but as he could see nothing but jar and not much of that he couldnt find his way so at last he lifted up his head jar and all and made a loud roaring noise of sadness and despair and it was at that moment that piglet looked down help help cried piglet a heffalump a horrible heffalump and he scampered off as hard as he could still crying out help help a herrible hoffalump hoff hoff a hellible horralump holl holl a hoffable hellerump and he didnt stop crying and scampering until he got to christopher robins house whatevers the matter piglet said christopher robin who was just getting up heff said piglet breathing so hard that he could hardly speak a heffa heffa heffalump where up there said piglet waving his paw what did it look like likelikeit had the biggest head you ever saw christopher robin a great enormous thing likelike nothing a huge bigwell like ai dont knowlike an enormous big nothing like a jar well said christopher robin putting on his shoes i shall go and look at it come on piglet wasnt afraid if he had christopher robin with him so off they went i can hear it cant you said piglet anxiously as they got near i can hear something said christopher robin it was pooh bumping his head against a treeroot he had found there said piglet isnt it awful and he held on tight to christopher robins hand suddenly christopher robin began to laugh and he laughed and he laughed and he laughed and while he was still laughingcrash went the heffalumps head against the treeroot smash went the jar and out came poohs head again then piglet saw what a foolish piglet he had been and he was so ashamed of himself that he ran straight off home and went to bed with a headache but christopher robin and pooh went home to breakfast together oh bear said christopher robin how i do love you so do i said pooh chapter vi in which eeyore has a birthday and gets two presents eeyore the old grey donkey stood by the side of the stream and looked at himself in the water pathetic he said thats what it is pathetic he turned and walked slowly down the stream for twenty yards splashed across it and walked slowly back on the other side then he looked at himself in the water again as i thought he said no better from this side but nobody minds nobody cares pathetic thats what it is there was a crackling noise in the bracken behind him and out came pooh good morning eeyore said pooh good morning pooh bear said eeyore gloomily if it is a good morning he said which i doubt said he why whats the matter nothing pooh bear nothing we cant all and some of us dont thats all there is to it cant all what said pooh rubbing his nose gaiety songanddance here we go round the mulberry bush oh said pooh he thought for a long time and then asked what mulberry bush is that bonhommy went on eeyore gloomily french word meaning bonhommy he explained im not complaining but there it is pooh sat down on a large stone and tried to think this out it sounded to him like a riddle and he was never much good at riddles being a bear of very little brain so he sang cottleston pie instead cottleston cottleston cottleston pie a fly cant bird but a bird can fly ask me a riddle and i reply cottleston cottleston cottleston pie that was the first verse when he had finished it eeyore didnt actually say that he didnt like it so pooh very kindly sang the second verse to him cottleston cottleston cottleston pie a fish cant whistle and neither can i ask me a riddle and i reply cottleston cottleston cottleston pie eeyore still said nothing at all so pooh hummed the third verse quietly to himself cottleston cottleston cottleston pie why does a chicken i dont know why ask me a riddle and i reply cottleston cottleston cottleston pie thats right said eeyore sing umtytiddly umtytoo here we go gathering nuts and may enjoy yourself i am said pooh some can said eeyore why whats the matter is anything the matter you seem so sad eeyore sad why should i be sad its my birthday the happiest day of the year your birthday said pooh in great surprise of course it is cant you see look at all the presents i have had he waved a foot from side to side look at the birthday cake candles and pink sugar pooh lookedfirst to the right and then to the left presents said pooh birthday cake said pooh where cant you see them no said pooh neither can i said eeyore joke he explained ha ha pooh scratched his head being a little puzzled by all this but is it really your birthday he asked it is oh well many happy returns of the day eeyore and many happy returns to you pooh bear but it isnt my birthday no its mine but you said many happy returns well why not you dont always want to be miserable on my birthday do you oh i see said pooh its bad enough said eeyore almost breaking down being miserable myself what with no presents and no cake and no candles and no proper notice taken of me at all but if everybody else is going to be miserable too this was too much for pooh stay there he called to eeyore as he turned and hurried back home as quick as he could for he felt that he must get poor eeyore a present of some sort at once and he could always think of a proper one afterwards outside his house he found piglet jumping up and down trying to reach the knocker hallo piglet he said hallo pooh said piglet what are you trying to do i was trying to reach the knocker said piglet i just came round let me do it for you said pooh kindly so he reached up and knocked at the door i have just seen eeyore he began and poor eeyore is in a very sad condition because its his birthday and nobody has taken any notice of it and hes very gloomyyou know what eeyore isand there he was andwhat a long time whoever lives here is answering this door and he knocked again but pooh said piglet its your own house oh said pooh so it is he said well lets go in so in they went the first thing pooh did was to go to the cupboard to see if he had quite a small jar of honey left and he had so he took it down im giving this to eeyore he explained as a present what are you going to give couldnt i give it too said piglet from both of us no said pooh that would not be a good plan all right then ill give him a balloon ive got one left from my party ill go and get it now shall i that piglet is a very good idea it is just what eeyore wants to cheer him up nobody can be uncheered with a balloon so off piglet trotted and in the other direction went pooh with his jar of honey it was a warm day and he had a long way to go he hadnt gone more than halfway when a sort of funny feeling began to creep all over him it began at the tip of his nose and trickled all through him and out at the soles of his feet it was just as if somebody inside him were saying now then pooh time for a little something dear dear said pooh i didnt know it was as late as that so he sat down and took the top off his jar of honey lucky i brought this with me he thought many a bear going out on a warm day like this would never have thought of bringing a little something with him and he began to eat now let me see he thought as he took his last lick of the inside of the jar where was i going ah yes eeyore he got up slowly and then suddenly he remembered he had eaten eeyores birthday present bother said pooh what shall i do i must give him something for a little while he couldnt think of anything then he thought well its a very nice pot even if theres no honey in it and if i washed it clean and got somebody to write a happy birthday on it eeyore could keep things in it which might be useful so as he was just passing the hundred acre wood he went inside to call on owl who lived there good morning owl he said good morning pooh said owl many happy returns of eeyores birthday said pooh oh is that what it is what are you giving him owl what are you giving him pooh im giving him a useful pot to keep things in and i wanted to ask you is this it said owl taking it out of poohs paw yes and i wanted to ask you somebody has been keeping honey in it said owl you can keep anything in it said pooh earnestly its very useful like that and i wanted to ask you you ought to write a happy birthday on it that was what i wanted to ask you said pooh because my spelling is wobbly its good spelling but it wobbles and the letters get in the wrong places would you write a happy birthday on it for me its a nice pot said owl looking at it all round couldnt i give it too from both of us no said pooh that would not be a good plan now ill just wash it first and then you can write on it well he washed the pot out and dried it while owl licked the end of his pencil and wondered how to spell birthday can you read pooh he asked a little anxiously theres a notice about knocking and ringing outside my door which christopher robin wrote could you read it christopher robin told me what it said and then i could well ill tell you what this says and then youll be able to so owl wrote and this is what he wrote hipy papy bthuthdth thuthda bthuthdy pooh looked on admiringly im just saying a happy birthday said owl carelessly its a nice long one said pooh very much impressed by it well actually of course im saying a very happy birthday with love from pooh naturally it takes a good deal of pencil to say a long thing like that oh i see said pooh while all this was happening piglet had gone back to his own house to get eeyores balloon he held it very tightly against himself so that it shouldnt blow away and he ran as fast as he could so as to get to eeyore before pooh did for he thought that he would like to be the first one to give a present just as if he had thought of it without being told by anybody and running along and thinking how pleased eeyore would be he didnt look where he was going and suddenly he put his foot in a rabbit hole and fell down flat on his face bang piglet lay there wondering what had happened at first he thought that the whole world had blown up and then he thought that perhaps only the forest part of it had and then he thought that perhaps only he had and he was now alone in the moon or somewhere and would never see christopher robin or pooh or eeyore again and then he thought well even if im in the moon i neednt be face downwards all the time so he got cautiously up and looked about him he was still in the forest well thats funny he thought i wonder what that bang was i couldnt have made such a noise just falling down and wheres my balloon and whats that small piece of damp rag doing it was the balloon oh dear said piglet oh dear oh dearie dearie dear well its too late now i cant go back and i havent another balloon and perhaps eeyore doesnt like balloons so very much so he trotted on rather sadly now and down he came to the side of the stream where eeyore was and called out to him good morning eeyore shouted piglet good morning little piglet said eeyore if it is a good morning he said which i doubt said he not that it matters he said many happy returns of the day said piglet having now got closer eeyore stopped looking at himself in the stream and turned to stare at piglet just say that again he said many hap wait a moment balancing on three legs he began to bring his fourth leg very cautiously up to his ear i did this yesterday he explained as he fell down for the third time its quite easy its so as i can hear better there thats done it now then what were you saying he pushed his ear forward with his hoof many happy returns of the day said piglet again meaning me of course eeyore my birthday yes me having a real birthday yes eeyore and ive brought you a present eeyore took down his right hoof from his right ear turned round and with great difficulty put up his left hoof i must have that in the other ear he said now then a present said piglet very loudly meaning me again yes my birthday still of course eeyore me going on having a real birthday yes eeyore and i brought you a balloon balloon said eeyore you did say balloon one of those big coloured things you blow up gaiety songanddance here we are and there we are yes but im afraidim very sorry eeyorebut when i was running along to bring it you i fell down dear dear how unlucky you ran too fast i expect you didnt hurt yourself little piglet no but iioh eeyore i burst the balloon there was a very long silence my balloon said eeyore at last piglet nodded my birthday balloon yes eeyore said piglet sniffing a little here it is withwith many happy returns of the day and he gave eeyore the small piece of damp rag is this it said eeyore a little surprised piglet nodded my present piglet nodded again the balloon yes thank you piglet said eeyore you dont mind my asking he went on but what colour was this balloon when itwhen it was a balloon red i just wondered red he murmured to himself my favourite colour how big was it about as big as me i just wondered about as big as piglet he said to himself sadly my favourite size well well piglet felt very miserable and didnt know what to say he was still opening his mouth to begin something and then deciding that it wasnt any good saying that when he heard a shout from the other side of the river and there was pooh many happy returns of the day called out pooh forgetting that he had said it already thank you pooh im having them said eeyore gloomily ive brought you a little present said pooh excitedly ive had it said eeyore pooh had now splashed across the stream to eeyore and piglet was sitting a little way off his head in his paws snuffling to himself its a useful pot said pooh here it is and its got a very happy birthday with love from pooh written on it thats what all that writing is and its for putting things in there when eeyore saw the pot he became quite excited why he said i believe my balloon will just go into that pot oh no eeyore said pooh balloons are much too big to go into pots what you do with a balloon is you hold the ballon not mine said eeyore proudly look piglet and as piglet looked sorrowfully round eeyore picked the balloon up with his teeth and placed it carefully in the pot picked it out and put it on the ground and then picked it up again and put it carefully back so it does said pooh it goes in so it does said piglet and it comes out doesnt it said eeyore it goes in and out like anything im very glad said pooh happily that i thought of giving you a useful pot to put things in im very glad said piglet happily that i thought of giving you something to put in a useful pot but eeyore wasnt listening he was taking the balloon out and putting it back again as happy as could be and didnt i give him anything asked christopher robin sadly of course you did i said you gave himdont you remembera littlea little i gave him a box of paints to paint things with that was it why didnt i give it to him in the morning you were so busy getting his party ready for him he had a cake with icing on the top and three candles and his name in pink sugar and yes i remember said christopher robin chapter vii in which kanga and baby roo come to the forest and piglet has a bath nobody seemed to know where they came from but there they were in the forest kanga and baby roo when pooh asked christopher robin how did they come here christopher robin said in the usual way if you know what i mean pooh and pooh who didnt said oh then he nodded his head twice and said in the usual way ah then he went to call upon his friend piglet to see what he thought about it and at piglets house he found rabbit so they all talked about it together what i dont like about it is this said rabbit here are weyou pooh and you piglet and meand suddenly and eeyore said pooh and eeyoreand then suddenly and owl said pooh and owland then all of a sudden oh and eeyore said pooh i was forgetting him hereweare said rabbit very slowly and carefully allofus and then suddenly we wake up one morning and what do we find we find a strange animal among us an animal of whom we have never even heard before an animal who carries her family about with her in her pocket suppose i carried my family about with me in my pocket how many pockets should i want sixteen said piglet seventeen isnt it said rabbit and one more for a handkerchiefthats eighteen eighteen pockets in one suit i havent time there was a long and thoughtful silence and then pooh who had been frowning very hard for some minutes said i make it fifteen what said rabbit fifteen fifteen what your family what about them pooh rubbed his nose and said that he thought rabbit had been talking about his family did i said rabbit carelessly yes you said never mind pooh said piglet impatiently the question is what are we to do about kanga oh i see said pooh the best way said rabbit would be this the best way would be to steal baby roo and hide him and then when kanga says wheres baby roo we say aha aha said pooh practising aha aha of course he went on we could say aha even if we hadnt stolen baby roo pooh said rabbit kindly you havent any brain i know said pooh humbly we say aha so that kanga knows that we know where baby roo is aha means well tell you where baby roo is if you promise to go away from the forest and never come back now dont talk while i think pooh went into a corner and tried saying aha in that sort of voice sometimes it seemed to him that it did mean what rabbit said and sometimes it seemed to him that it didnt i suppose its just practice he thought i wonder if kanga will have to practise too so as to understand it theres just one thing said piglet fidgeting a bit i was talking to christopher robin and he said that a kanga was generally regarded as one of the fiercer animals i am not frightened of fierce animals in the ordinary way but it is well known that if one of the fiercer animals is deprived of its young it becomes as fierce as two of the fiercer animals in which case aha is perhaps a foolish thing to say piglet said rabbit taking out a pencil and licking the end of it you havent any pluck it is hard to be brave said piglet sniffing slightly when youre only a very small animal rabbit who had begun to write very busily looked up and said it is because you are a very small animal that you will be useful in the adventure before us piglet was so excited at the idea of being useful that he forgot to be frightened any more and when rabbit went on to say that kangas were only fierce during the winter months being at other times of an affectionate disposition he could hardly sit still he was so eager to begin being useful at once what about me said pooh sadly i suppose i shant be useful never mind pooh said piglet comfortingly another time perhaps without pooh said rabbit solemnly as he sharpened his pencil the adventure would be impossible oh said piglet and tried not to look disappointed but pooh went into a corner of the room and said proudly to himself impossible without me that sort of bear now listen all of you said rabbit when he had finished writing and pooh and piglet sat listening very eagerly with their mouths open this was what rabbit read out plan to capture baby roo general remarks kanga runs faster than any of us even me more general remarks kanga never takes her eye off baby roo except when hes safely buttoned up in her pocket therefore if we are to capture baby roo we must get a long start because kanga runs faster than any of us even me see a thought if roo had jumped out of kangas pocket and piglet had jumped in kanga wouldnt know the difference because piglet is a very small animal like roo but kanga would have to be looking the other way first so as not to see piglet jumping in see another thought but if pooh was talking to her very excitedly she might look the other way for a moment and then i could run away with roo quickly and kanga wouldnt discover the difference until afterwards well rabbit read this out proudly and for a little while after he had read it nobody said anything and then piglet who had been opening and shutting his mouth without making any noise managed to say very huskily andafterwards how do you mean when kanga does discover the difference then we all say aha all three of us yes oh why whats the trouble piglet nothing said piglet as long as we all three say it as long as we all three say it said piglet i dont mind he said but i shouldnt care to say aha by myself it wouldnt sound nearly so well by the way he said you are quite sure about what you said about the winter months the winter months yes only being fierce in the winter months oh yes yes thats all right well pooh you see what you have to do no said pooh bear not yet he said what do i do well you just have to talk very hard to kanga so as she doesnt notice anything oh what about anything you like you mean like telling her a little bit of poetry or something thats it said rabbit splendid now come along so they all went out to look for kanga kanga and roo were spending a quiet afternoon in a sandy part of the forest baby roo was practising very small jumps in the sand and falling down mouseholes and climbing out of them and kanga was fidgeting about and saying just one more jump dear and then we must go home and at that moment who should come stumping up the hill but pooh good afternoon kanga good afternoon pooh look at me jumping squeaked roo and fell into another mousehole hallo roo my little fellow we were just going home said kanga good afternoon rabbit good afternoon piglet rabbit and piglet who had now come up from the other side of the hill said good afternoon and hallo roo and roo asked them to look at him jumping so they stayed and looked and kanga looked too oh kanga said pooh after rabbit had winked at him twice i dont know if you are interested in poetry at all hardly at all said kanga oh said pooh roo dear just one more jump and then we must go home there was a short silence while roo fell down another mousehole go on said rabbit in a loud whisper behind his paw talking of poetry said pooh i made up a little piece as i was coming along it went like this ernow let me see fancy said kanga now roo dear youll like this piece of poetry said rabbit youll love it said piglet you must listen very carefully said rabbit so as not to miss any of it said piglet oh yes said kanga but she still looked at baby roo how did it go pooh said rabbit pooh gave a little cough and began lines written by a bear of very little brain on monday when the sun is hot i wonder to myself a lot now is it true or is it not that what is which and which is what on tuesday when it hails and snows the feeling on me grows and grows that hardly anybody knows if those are these or these are those on wednesday when the sky is blue and i have nothing else to do i sometimes wonder if its true that who is what and what is who on thursday when it starts to freeze and hoarfrost twinkles on the trees how very readily one sees that these are whosebut whose are these on friday yes it is isnt it said kanga not waiting to hear what happened on friday just one more jump roo dear and then we really must be going rabbit gave pooh a hurryingup sort of nudge talking of poetry said pooh quickly have you ever noticed that tree right over there where said kanga now roo right over there said pooh pointing behind kangas back no said kanga now jump in roo dear and well go home you ought to look at that tree right over there said rabbit shall i lift you in roo and he picked up roo in his paws i can see a bird in it from here said pooh or is it a fish you ought to see that bird from here said rabbit unless its a fish it isnt a fish its a bird said piglet so it is said rabbit is it a starling or a blackbird said pooh thats the whole question said rabbit is it a blackbird or a starling and then at last kanga did turn her head to look and the moment that her head was turned rabbit said in a loud voice in you go roo and in jumped piglet into kangas pocket and off scampered rabbit with roo in his paws as fast as he could why wheres rabbit said kanga turning round again are you all right roo dear piglet made a squeaky roonoise from the bottom of kangas pocket rabbit had to go away said pooh i think he thought of something he had to go and see about suddenly and piglet i think piglet thought of something at the same time suddenly well we must be getting home said kanga goodbye pooh and in three large jumps she was gone pooh looked after her as she went i wish i could jump like that he thought some can and some cant thats how it is but there were moments when piglet wished that kanga couldnt often when he had had a long walk home through the forest he had wished that he were a bird but now he thought jerkily to himself at the bottom of kangas pocket this take if is shall really to flying i never it and as he went up in the air he said ooooooo and as he came down he said ow and he was saying oooooooow oooooooow oooooooow all the way to kangas house of course as soon as kanga unbuttoned her pocket she saw what had happened just for a moment she thought she was frightened and then she knew she wasnt for she felt quite sure that christopher robin would never let any harm happen to roo so she said to herself if they are having a joke with me i will have a joke with them now then roo dear she said as she took piglet out of her pocket bedtime aha said piglet as well as he could after his terrifying journey but it wasnt a very good aha and kanga didnt seem to understand what it meant bath first said kanga in a cheerful voice aha said piglet again looking round anxiously for the others but the others werent there rabbit was playing with baby roo in his own house and feeling more fond of him every minute and pooh who had decided to be a kanga was still at the sandy place on the top of the forest practising jumps i am not at all sure said kanga in a thoughtful voice that it wouldnt be a good idea to have a cold bath this evening would you like that roo dear piglet who had never been really fond of baths shuddered a long indignant shudder and said in as brave a voice as he could kanga i see that the time has come to spleak painly funny little roo said kanga as she got the bathwater ready i am not roo said piglet loudly i am piglet yes dear yes said kanga soothingly and imitating piglets voice too so clever of him she went on as she took a large bar of yellow soap out of the cupboard what will he be doing next cant you see shouted piglet havent you got eyes look at me i am looking roo dear said kanga rather severely and you know what i told you yesterday about making faces if you go on making faces like piglets you will grow up to look like pigletand then think how sorry you will be now then into the bath and dont let me have to speak to you about it again before he knew where he was piglet was in the bath and kanga was scrubbing him firmly with a large lathery flannel ow cried piglet let me out im piglet dont open the mouth dear or the soap goes in said kanga there what did i tell you youyouyou did it on purpose spluttered piglet as soon as he could speak again and then accidentally had another mouthful of lathery flannel thats right dear dont say anything said kanga and in another minute piglet was out of the bath and being rubbed dry with a towel now said kanga theres your medicine and then bed wwwhat medicine said piglet to make you grow big and strong dear you dont want to grow up small and weak like piglet do you well then at that moment there was a knock at the door come in said kanga and in came christopher robin christopher robin christopher robin cried piglet tell kanga who i am she keeps saying im roo im not roo am i christopher robin looked at him very carefully and shook his head you cant be roo he said because ive just seen roo playing in rabbits house well said kanga fancy that fancy my making a mistake like that there you are said piglet i told you so im piglet christopher robin shook his head again oh youre not piglet he said i know piglet well and hes quite a different colour piglet began to say that this was because he had just had a bath and then he thought that perhaps he wouldnt say that and as he opened his mouth to say something else kanga slipped the medicine spoon in and then patted him on the back and told him that it was really quite a nice taste when you got used to it i knew it wasnt piglet said kanga i wonder who it can be perhaps its some relation of poohs said christopher robin what about a nephew or an uncle or something kanga agreed that this was probably what it was and said that they would have to call it by some name i shall call it pootel said christopher robin henry pootel for short and just when it was decided henry pootel wriggled out of kangas arms and jumped to the ground to his great joy christopher robin had left the door open never had henry pootel piglet run so fast as he ran then and he didnt stop running until he had got quite close to his house but when he was a hundred yards away he stopped running and rolled the rest of the way home so as to get his own nice comfortable colour again so kanga and roo stayed in the forest and every tuesday roo spent the day with his great friend rabbit and every tuesday kanga spent the day with her great friend pooh teaching him to jump and every tuesday piglet spent the day with his great friend christopher robin so they were all happy again chapter viii in which christopher robin leads an expotition to the north pole one fine day pooh had stumped up to the top of the forest to see if his friend christopher robin was interested in bears at all at breakfast that morning a simple meal of marmalade spread lightly over a honeycomb or two he had suddenly thought of a new song it began like this sing ho for the life of a bear when he had got as far as this he scratched his head and thought to himself thats a very good start for a song but what about the second line he tried singing ho two or three times but it didnt seem to help perhaps it would be better he thought if i sang hi for the life of a bear so he sang it but it wasnt very well then he said i shall sing that first line twice and perhaps if i sing it very quickly i shall find myself singing the third and fourth lines before i have time to think of them and that will be a good song now then sing ho for the life of a bear sing ho for the life of a bear i dont much mind if it rains or snows cos ive got a lot of honey on my nice new nose i dont much care if it snows or thaws cos ive got a lot of honey on my nice clean paws sing ho for a bear sing ho for a pooh and ill have a little something in an hour or two he was so pleased with this song that he sang it all the way to the top of the forest and if i go on singing it much longer he thought it will be time for the little something and then the last line wont be true so he turned it into a hum instead christopher robin was sitting outside his door putting on his big boots as soon as he saw the big boots pooh knew that an adventure was going to happen and he brushed the honey off his nose with the back of his paw and spruced himself up as well as he could so as to look ready for anything goodmorning christopher robin he called out hallo pooh bear i cant get this boot on thats bad said pooh do you think you could very kindly lean against me cos i keep pulling so hard that i fall over backwards pooh sat down dug his feet into the ground and pushed hard against christopher robins back and christopher robin pushed hard against his and pulled and pulled at his boot until he had got it on and thats that said pooh what do we do next we are all going on an expedition said christopher robin as he got up and brushed himself thank you pooh going on an expotition said pooh eagerly i dont think ive ever been on one of those where are we going to on this expotition expedition silly old bear its got an x in it oh said pooh i know but he didnt really were going to discover the north pole oh said pooh again what is the north pole he asked its just a thing you discover said christopher robin carelessly not being quite sure himself oh i see said pooh are bears any good at discovering it of course they are and rabbit and kanga and all of you its an expedition thats what an expedition means a long line of everybody youd better tell the others to get ready while i see if my guns all right and we must all bring provisions bring what things to eat oh said pooh happily i thought you said provisions ill go and tell them and he stumped off the first person he met was rabbit hallo rabbit he said is that you lets pretend it isnt said rabbit and see what happens ive got a message for you ill give it to him were all going on an expotition with christopher robin what is it when were on it a sort of boat i think said pooh oh that sort yes and were going to discover a pole or something or was it a mole anyhow were going to discover it we are are we said rabbit yes and weve got to bring prothings to eat with us in case we want to eat them now im going down to piglets tell kanga will you he left rabbit and hurried down to piglets house the piglet was sitting on the ground at the door of his house blowing happily at a dandelion and wondering whether it would be this year next year sometime or never he had just discovered that it would be never and was trying to remember what it was and hoping it wasnt anything nice when pooh came up oh piglet said pooh excitedly were going on an expotition all of us with things to eat to discover something to discover what said piglet anxiously oh just something nothing fierce christopher robin didnt say anything about fierce he just said it had an x it isnt their necks i mind said piglet earnestly its their teeth but if christopher robin is coming i dont mind anything in a little while they were all ready at the top of the forest and the expotition started first came christopher robin and rabbit then piglet and pooh then kanga with roo in her pocket and owl then eeyore and at the end in a long line all rabbits friendsandrelations i didnt ask them explained rabbit carelessly they just came they always do they can march at the end after eeyore what i say said eeyore is that its unsettling i didnt want to come on this expowhat pooh said i only came to oblige but here i am and if i am the end of the expowhat were talking aboutthen let me be the end but if every time i want to sit down for a little rest i have to brush away half a dozen of rabbits smaller friendsandrelations first then this isnt an expowhatever it isat all its simply a confused noise thats what i say i see what eeyore means said owl if you ask me im not asking anybody said eeyore im just telling everybody we can look for the north pole or we can play here we go gathering nuts and may with the end part of an ants nest its all the same to me there was a shout from the top of the line come on called christopher robin come on called pooh and piglet come on called owl were starting said rabbit i must go and he hurried off to the front of the expotition with christopher robin all right said eeyore were going only dont blame me so off they all went to discover the pole and as they walked they chattered to each other of this and that all except pooh who was making up a song this is the first verse he said to piglet when he was ready with it first verse of what my song what song this one which one well if you listen piglet youll hear it how do you know im not listening pooh couldnt answer that one so he began to sing they all went off to discover the pole owl and piglet and rabbit and all its a thing you discover as ive been tole by owl and piglet and rabbit and all eeyore christopher robin and pooh and rabbits relations all went too and where the pole was none of them knew sing hey for owl and rabbit and all hush said christopher robin turning round to pooh were just coming to a dangerous place hush said pooh turning round quickly to piglet hush said piglet to kanga hush said kanga to owl while roo said hush several times to himself very quietly hush said owl to eeyore hush said eeyore in a terrible voice to all rabbits friendsandrelations and hush they said hastily to each other all down the line until it got to the last one of all and the last and smallest friendandrelation was so upset to find that the whole expotition was saying hush to him that he buried himself head downwards in a crack in the ground and stayed there for two days until the danger was over and then went home in a great hurry and lived quietly with his aunt everafterwards his name was alexander beetle they had come to a stream which twisted and tumbled between high rocky banks and christopher robin saw at once how dangerous it was its just the place he explained for an ambush what sort of bush whispered pooh to piglet a gorsebush my dear pooh said owl in his superior way dont you know what an ambush is owl said piglet looking round at him severely poohs whisper was a perfectly private whisper and there was no need an ambush said owl is a sort of surprise so is a gorsebush sometimes said pooh an ambush as i was about to explain to pooh said piglet is a sort of surprise if people jump out at you suddenly thats an ambush said owl its an ambush pooh when people jump at you suddenly explained piglet pooh who now knew what an ambush was said that a gorsebush had sprung at him suddenly one day when he fell off a tree and he had taken six days to get all the prickles out of himself we are not talking about gorsebushes said owl a little crossly i am said pooh they were climbing very cautiously up the stream now going from rock to rock and after they had gone a little way they came to a place where the banks widened out at each side so that on each side of the water there was a level strip of grass on which they could sit down and rest as soon as he saw this christopher robin called halt and they all sat down and rested i think said christopher robin that we ought to eat all our provisions now so that we shant have so much to carry eat all our what said pooh all that weve brought said piglet getting to work thats a good idea said pooh and he got to work too have you all got something asked christopher robin with his mouth full all except me said eeyore as usual he looked round at them in his melancholy way i suppose none of you are sitting on a thistle by any chance i believe i am said pooh ow he got up and looked behind him yes i was i thought so thank you pooh if youve quite finished with it he moved across to poohs place and began to eat it dont do them any good you know sitting on them he went on as he looked up munching takes all the life out of them remember that another time all of you a little consideration a little thought for others makes all the difference as soon as he had finished his lunch christopher robin whispered to rabbit and rabbit said yes yes of course and they walked a little way up the stream together i didnt want the others to hear said christopher robin quite so said rabbit looking important itsi wonderedits onlyrabbit i suppose you dont know what does the north pole look like well said rabbit stroking his whiskers now youre asking me i did know once only ive sort of forgotten said christopher robin carelessly its a funny thing said rabbit but ive sort of forgotten too although i did know once i suppose its just a pole stuck in the ground sure to be a pole said rabbit because of calling it a pole and if its a pole well i should think it would be sticking in the ground shouldnt you because thered be nowhere else to stick it yes thats what i thought the only thing said rabbit is where is it sticking thats what were looking for said christopher robin they went back to the others piglet was lying on his back sleeping peacefully roo was washing his face and paws in the stream while kanga explained to everybody proudly that this was the first time he had ever washed his face himself and owl was telling kanga an interesting anecdote full of long words like encyclopdia and rhododendron to which kanga wasnt listening i dont hold with all this washing grumbled eeyore this modern behindtheears nonsense what do you think pooh well said pooh i think but we shall never know what pooh thought for there came a sudden squeak from roo a splash and a loud cry of alarm from kanga so much for washing said eeyore roos fallen in cried rabbit and he and christopher robin came rushing down to the rescue look at me swimming squeaked roo from the middle of his pool and was hurried down a waterfall into the next pool are you all right roo dear called kanga anxiously yes said roo look at me sw and down he went over the next waterfall into another pool everybody was doing something to help piglet wide awake suddenly was jumping up and down and making oo i say noises owl was explaining that in a case of sudden and temporary immersion the important thing was to keep the head above water kanga was jumping along the bank saying are you sure youre all right roo dear to which roo from whatever pool he was in at the moment was answering look at me swimming eeyore had turned round and hung his tail over the first pool into which roo fell and with his back to the accident was grumbling quietly to himself and saying all this washing but catch on to my tail little roo and youll be all right and christopher robin and rabbit came hurrying past eeyore and were calling out to the others in front of them all right roo im coming called christopher robin get something across the stream lower down some of you fellows called rabbit but pooh was getting something two pools below roo he was standing with a long pole in his paws and kanga came up and took one end of it and between them they held it across the lower part of the pool and roo still bubbling proudly look at me swimming drifted up against it and climbed out did you see me swimming squeaked roo excitedly while kanga scolded him and rubbed him down pooh did you see me swimming thats called swimming what i was doing rabbit did you see what i was doing swimming hallo piglet i say piglet what do you think i was doing swimming christopher robin did you see me but christopher robin wasnt listening he was looking at pooh pooh he said where did you find that pole pooh looked at the pole in his hands i just found it he said i thought it ought to be useful i just picked it up pooh said christopher robin solemnly the expedition is over you have found the north pole oh said pooh eeyore was sitting with his tail in the water when they all got back to him tell roo to be quick somebody he said my tails getting cold i dont want to mention it but i just mention it i dont want to complain but there it is my tails cold here i am squeaked roo oh there you are did you see me swimming eeyore took his tail out of the water and swished it from side to side as i expected he said lost all feeling numbed it thats what its done numbed it well as long as nobody minds i suppose its all right poor old eeyore ill dry it for you said christopher robin and he took out his handkerchief and rubbed it up thank you christopher robin youre the only one who seems to understand about tails they dont thinkthats what the matter with some of these others theyve no imagination a tail isnt a tail to them its just a little bit extra at the back never mind eeyore said christopher robin rubbing his hardest is that better its feeling more like a tail perhaps it belongs again if you know what i mean hullo eeyore said pooh coming up to them with his pole hullo pooh thank you for asking but i shall be able to use it again in a day or two use what said pooh what we are talking about i wasnt talking about anything said pooh looking puzzled my mistake again i thought you were saying how sorry you were about my tail being all numb and could you do anything to help no said pooh that wasnt me he said he thought for a little and then suggested helpfully perhaps it was somebody else well thank him for me when you see him pooh looked anxiously at christopher robin poohs found the north pole said christopher robin isnt that lovely pooh looked modestly down is that it said eeyore yes said christopher robin is that what we were looking for yes said pooh oh said eeyore well anyhowit didnt rain he said they stuck the pole in the ground and christopher robin tied a message on to it north pole discovered by pooh pooh found it then they all went home again and i think but i am not quite sure that roo had a hot bath and went straight to bed but pooh went back to his own house and feeling very proud of what he had done had a little something to revive himself chapter ix in which piglet is entirely surrounded by water it rained and it rained and it rained piglet told himself that never in all his life and he was goodness knows how oldthree was it or fournever had he seen so much rain days and days and days if only he thought as he looked out of the window i had been in poohs house or christopher robins house or rabbits house when it began to rain then i should have had company all this time instead of being here all alone with nothing to do except wonder when it will stop and he imagined himself with pooh saying did you ever see such rain pooh and pooh saying isnt it awful piglet and piglet saying i wonder how it is over christopher robins way and pooh saying i should think poor old rabbit is about flooded out by this time it would have been jolly to talk like this and really it wasnt much good having anything exciting like floods if you couldnt share them with somebody for it was rather exciting the little dry ditches in which piglet had nosed about so often had become streams the little streams across which he had splashed were rivers and the river between whose steep banks they had played so happily had sprawled out of its own bed and was taking up so much room everywhere that piglet was beginning to wonder whether it would be coming into his bed soon its a little anxious he said to himself to be a very small animal entirely surrounded by water christopher robin and pooh could escape by climbing trees and kanga could escape by jumping and rabbit could escape by burrowing and owl could escape by flying and eeyore could escape byby making a loud noise until rescued and here am i surrounded by water and i cant do anything it went on raining and every day the water got a little higher until now it was nearly up to piglets window and still he hadnt done anything theres pooh he thought to himself pooh hasnt much brain but he never comes to any harm he does silly things and they turn out right theres owl owl hasnt exactly got brain but he knows things he would know the right thing to do when surrounded by water theres rabbit he hasnt learnt in books but he can always think of a clever plan theres kanga she isnt clever kanga isnt but she would be so anxious about roo that she would do a good thing to do without thinking about it and then theres eeyore and eeyore is so miserable anyhow that he wouldnt mind about this but i wonder what christopher robin would do then suddenly he remembered a story which christopher robin had told him about a man on a desert island who had written something in a bottle and thrown it in the sea and piglet thought that if he wrote something in a bottle and threw it in the water perhaps somebody would come and rescue him he left the window and began to search his house all of it that wasnt under water and at last he found a pencil and a small piece of dry paper and a bottle with a cork to it and he wrote on one side of the paper help piglet me and on the other side its me piglet help help then he put the paper in the bottle and he corked the bottle up as tightly as he could and he leant out of his window as far as he could lean without falling in and he threw the bottle as far as he could throwsplashand in a little while it bobbed up again on the water and he watched it floating slowly away in the distance until his eyes ached with looking and sometimes he thought it was the bottle and sometimes he thought it was just a ripple on the water which he was following and then suddenly he knew that he would never see it again and that he had done all that he could do to save himself so now he thought somebody else will have to do something and i hope they will do it soon because if they dont i shall have to swim which i cant so i hope they do it soon and then he gave a very long sigh and said i wish pooh were here its so much more friendly with two when the rain began pooh was asleep it rained and it rained and it rained and he slept and he slept and he slept he had had a tiring day you remember how he discovered the north pole well he was so proud of this that he asked christopher robin if there were any other poles such as a bear of little brain might discover theres a south pole said christopher robin and i expect theres an east pole and a west pole though people dont like talking about them pooh was very excited when he heard this and suggested that they should have an expotition to discover the east pole but christopher robin had thought of something else to do with kanga so pooh went out to discover the east pole by himself whether he discovered it or not i forget but he was so tired when he got home that in the very middle of his supper after he had been eating for little more than halfanhour he fell fast asleep in his chair and slept and slept and slept then suddenly he was dreaming he was at the east pole and it was a very cold pole with the coldest sort of snow and ice all over it he had found a beehive to sleep in but there wasnt room for his legs so he had left them outside and wild woozles such as inhabit the east pole came and nibbled all the fur off his legs to make nests for their young and the more they nibbled the colder his legs got until suddenly he woke up with an owand there he was sitting in his chair with his feet in the water and water all round him he splashed to his door and looked out this is serious said pooh i must have an escape so he took his largest pot of honey and escaped with it to a broad branch of his tree well above the water and then he climbed down again and escaped with another pot and when the whole escape was finished there was pooh sitting on his branch dangling his legs and there beside him were ten pots of honey two days later there was pooh sitting on his branch dangling his legs and there beside him were four pots of honey three days later there was pooh sitting on his branch dangling his legs and there beside him was one pot of honey four days later there was pooh and it was on the morning of the fourth day that piglets bottle came floating past him and with one loud cry of honey pooh plunged into the water seized the bottle and struggled back to his tree again bother said pooh as he opened it all that wet for nothing whats that bit of paper doing he took it out and looked at it its a missage he said to himself thats what it is and that letter is a p and so is that and so is that and p means pooh so its a very important missage to me and i cant read it i must find christopher robin or owl or piglet one of those clever readers who can read things and they will tell me what this missage means only i cant swim bother then he had an idea and i think that for a bear of very little brain it was a good idea he said to himself if a bottle can float then a jar can float and if a jar floats i can sit on the top of it if its a very big jar so he took his biggest jar and corked it up all boats have to have a name he said so i shall call mine the floating bear and with these words he dropped his boat into the water and jumped in after it for a little while pooh and the floating bear were uncertain as to which of them was meant to be on the top but after trying one or two different positions they settled down with the floating bear underneath and pooh triumphantly astride it paddling vigorously with his feet christopher robin lived at the very top of the forest it rained and it rained and it rained but the water couldnt come up to his house it was rather jolly to look down into the valleys and see the water all round him but it rained so hard that he stayed indoors most of the time and thought about things every morning he went out with his umbrella and put a stick in the place where the water came up to and every next morning he went out and couldnt see his stick any more so he put another stick in the place where the water came up to and then he walked home again and each morning he had a shorter way to walk than he had had the morning before on the morning of the fifth day he saw the water all round him and knew that for the first time in his life he was on a real island which was very exciting it was on this morning that owl came flying over the water to say how do you do to his friend christopher robin i say owl said christopher robin isnt this fun im on an island the atmospheric conditions have been very unfavourable lately said owl the what it has been raining explained owl yes said christopher robin it has the floodlevel has reached an unprecedented height the who theres a lot of water about explained owl yes said christopher robin there is however the prospects are rapidly becoming more favourable at any moment have you seen pooh no at any moment i hope hes all right said christopher robin ive been wondering about him i expect piglets with him do you think theyre all right owl i expect so you see at any moment do go and see owl because pooh hasnt got very much brain and he might do something silly and i do love him so owl do you see owl thats all right said owl ill go back directly and he flew off in a little while he was back again pooh isnt there he said not there has been there hes been sitting on a branch of his tree outside his house with nine pots of honey but he isnt there now oh pooh cried christopher robin where are you here i am said a growly voice behind him pooh they rushed into each others arms how did you get here pooh asked christopher robin when he was ready to talk again on my boat said pooh proudly i had a very important missage sent me in a bottle and owing to having got some water in my eyes i couldnt read it so i brought it to you on my boat with these proud words he gave christopher robin the missage but its from piglet cried christopher robin when he had read it isnt there anything about pooh in it asked bear looking over his shoulder christopher robin read the message aloud oh are those ps piglets i thought they were poohs we must rescue him at once i thought he was with you pooh owl could you rescue him on your back i dont think so said owl after grave thought it is doubtful if the necessary dorsal muscles then would you fly to him at once and say that rescue is coming and pooh and i will think of a rescue and come as quick as ever we can oh dont talk owl go on quick and still thinking of something to say owl flew off now then pooh said christopher robin wheres your boat i ought to say explained pooh as they walked down to the shore of the island that it isnt just an ordinary sort of boat sometimes its a boat and sometimes its more of an accident it all depends depends on what on whether im on the top of it or underneath it oh well where is it there said pooh pointing proudly to the floating bear it wasnt what christopher robin expected and the more he looked at it the more he thought what a brave and clever bear pooh was and the more christopher robin thought this the more pooh looked modestly down his nose and tried to pretend he wasnt but its too small for two of us said christopher robin sadly three of us with piglet that makes it smaller still oh pooh bear what shall we do and then this bear pooh bear winniethepooh fop friend of piglets rc rabbits companion pd pole discoverer ec and tf eeyores comforter and tailfinderin fact pooh himselfsaid something so clever that christopher robin could only look at him with mouth open and eyes staring wondering if this was really the bear of very little brain whom he had known and loved so long we might go in your umbrella said pooh we might go in your umbrella said pooh we might go in your umbrella said pooh for suddenly christopher robin saw that they might he opened his umbrella and put it point downwards in the water it floated but wobbled pooh got in he was just beginning to say that it was all right now when he found that it wasnt so after a short drink which he didnt really want he waded back to christopher robin then they both got in together and it wobbled no longer i shall call this boat the brain of pooh said christopher robin and the brain of pooh set sail forthwith in a southwesterly direction revolving gracefully you can imagine piglets joy when at last the ship came in sight of him in afteryears he liked to think that he had been in very great danger during the terrible flood but the only danger he had really been in was in the last halfhour of his imprisonment when owl who had just flown up sat on a branch of his tree to comfort him and told him a very long story about an aunt who had once laid a seagulls egg by mistake and the story went on and on rather like this sentence until piglet who was listening out of his window without much hope went to sleep quietly and naturally slipping slowly out of the window towards the water until he was only hanging on by his toes at which moment luckily a sudden loud squawk from owl which was really part of the story being what his aunt said woke the piglet up and just gave him time to jerk himself back into safety and say how interesting and did she whenwell you can imagine his joy when at last he saw the good ship brain of pooh captain c robin st mate p bear coming over the sea to rescue him christopher robin and pooh again and that is really the end of the story and i am very tired after that last sentence i think i shall stop there chapter x in which christopher robin gives pooh a party and we say goodbye one day when the sun had come back over the forest bringing with it the scent of may and all the streams of the forest were tinkling happily to find themselves their own pretty shape again and the little pools lay dreaming of the life they had seen and the big things they had done and in the warmth and quiet of the forest the cuckoo was trying over his voice carefully and listening to see if he liked it and woodpigeons were complaining gently to themselves in their lazy comfortable way that it was the other fellows fault but it didnt matter very much on such a day as this christopher robin whistled in a special way he had and owl came flying out of the hundred acre wood to see what was wanted owl said christopher robin i am going to give a party you are are you said owl and its to be a special sort of party because its because of what pooh did when he did what he did to save piglet from the flood oh thats what its for is it said owl yes so will you tell pooh as quickly as you can and all the others because it will be tomorrow oh it will will it said owl still being as helpful as possible so will you go and tell them owl owl tried to think of something very wise to say but couldnt so he flew off to tell the others and the first person he told was pooh pooh he said christopher robin is giving a party oh said pooh and then seeing that owl expected him to say something else he said will there be those little cake things with pink sugar icing owl felt that it was rather beneath him to talk about little cake things with pink sugar icing so he told pooh exactly what christopher robin had said and flew off to eeyore a party for me thought pooh to himself how grand and he began to wonder if all the other animals would know that it was a special pooh party and if christopher robin had told them about the floating bear and the brain of pooh and all the wonderful ships he had invented and sailed on and he began to think how awful it would be if everybody had forgotten about it and nobody quite knew what the party was for and the more he thought like this the more the party got muddled in his mind like a dream when nothing goes right and the dream began to sing itself over in his head until it became a sort of song it was an anxious pooh song cheers for pooh for who for pooh why what did he do i thought you knew he saved his friend from a wetting cheers for bear for where for bear he couldnt swim but he rescued him he rescued who oh listen do i am talking of pooh of who of pooh im sorry i keep forgetting well pooh was a bear of enormous brain just say it again of enormous brain of enormous what well he ate a lot and i dont know if he could swim or not but he managed to float on a sort of boat on a sort of what well a sort of pot so now lets give him three hearty cheers so now lets give him three hearty whiches and hope hell be with us for years and years and grow in health and wisdom and riches cheers for pooh for who for pooh cheers for bear for where for bear cheers for the wonderful winniethepooh just tell me somebodywhat did he do while this was going on inside him owl was talking to eeyore eeyore said owl

fellow with the excited ears thats piglet ill tell him no no said owl getting quite fussy its you are you sure of course im sure christopher robin said all of them tell all of them all of them except eeyore all of them said owl sulkily ah said eeyore a mistake no doubt but still i shall come only dont blame me if it rains but it didnt rain christopher robin had made a long table out of some long pieces of wood and they all sat round it christopher robin sat at one end and pooh sat at the other and between them on one side were owl and eeyore and piglet and between them on the other side were rabbit and roo and kanga and all rabbits friends and relations spread themselves about on the grass and waited hopefully in case anybody spoke to them or dropped anything or asked them the time it was the first party to which roo had ever been and he was very excited as soon as ever they had sat down he began to talk hallo pooh he squeaked hallo roo said pooh roo jumped up and down in his seat for a little while and then began again hallo piglet he squeaked piglet waved a paw at him being too busy to say anything hallo eeyore said roo eeyore nodded gloomily at him it will rain soon you see if it doesnt he said roo looked to see if it didnt and it didnt so he said hallo owland owl said hallo my little fellow in a kindly way and went on telling christopher robin about an accident which had nearly happened to a friend of his whom christopher robin didnt know and kanga said to roo drink up your milk first dear and talk afterwards so roo who was drinking his milk tried to say that he could do both at once and had to be patted on the back and dried for quite a long time afterwards when they had all nearly eaten enough christopher robin banged on the table with his spoon and everybody stopped talking and was very silent except roo who was just finishing a loud attack of hiccups and trying to look as if it was one of rabbits relations this party said christopher robin is a party because of what someone did and we all know who it was and its his party because of what he did and ive got a present for him and here it is then he felt about a little and whispered where is it while he was looking eeyore coughed in an impressive way and began to speak friends he said including oddments it is a great pleasure or perhaps i had better say it has been a pleasure so far to see you at my party what i did was nothing any of youexcept rabbit and owl and kangawould have done the same oh and pooh my remarks do not of course apply to piglet and roo because they are too small any of you would have done the same but it just happened to be me it was not i need hardly say with an idea of getting what christopher robin is looking for nowand he put his front leg to his mouth and said in a loud whisper try under the tablethat i did what i didbut because i feel that we should all do what we can to help i feel that we should all hhup said roo accidentally roo dear said kanga reproachfully was it me asked roo a little surprised whats eeyore talking about piglet whispered to pooh i dont know said pooh rather dolefully i thought this was your party i thought it was once but i suppose it isnt id sooner it was yours than eeyores said piglet so would i said pooh hhup said roo again asiwassaying said eeyore loudly and sternly as i was saying when i was interrupted by various loud sounds

going on nobody was listening for they were all saying open it pooh what is it pooh i know what it is no you dont and other helpful remarks of this sort and of course pooh was opening it as quickly as ever he could but without cutting the string because you never know when a bit of string might be useful at last it was undone when pooh saw what it was he nearly fell down he was so pleased it was a special pencil case there were pencils in it marked b for bear and pencils marked hb for helping bear and pencils marked bb for brave bear there was a knife for sharpening the pencils and indiarubber for rubbing out anything which you had spelt wrong and a ruler for ruling lines for the words to walk on and inches marked on the ruler in case you wanted to know how many inches anything was and blue pencils and red pencils and green pencils for saying special things in blue and red and green and all these lovely things were in little pockets of their own in a special case which shut with a click when you clicked it and they were all for pooh oh said pooh oh pooh said everybody else except eeyore thankyou growled pooh but eeyore was saying to himself this writing business pencils and whatnot overrated if you ask me silly stuff nothing in it later on when they had all said goodbye and thankyou to christopher robin pooh and piglet walked home thoughtfully together in the golden evening and for a long time they were silent when you wake up in the morning pooh said piglet at last whats the first thing you say to yourself whats for breakfast said pooh what do you say piglet i say i wonder whats going to happen exciting today said piglet pooh nodded thoughtfully its the same thing he said and what did happen asked christopher robin when next morning i dont know could you think and tell
