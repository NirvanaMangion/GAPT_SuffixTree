with what we at present know is for the most part to shut our ears against conviction since from the very gradual character of our education we must continually forget and emancipate ourselves from knowledge previously acquired we must set aside old notions and embrace fresh ones and as we learn we must be daily unlearning something which it has cost us no small labour and anxiety to acquire and this difficulty attaches itself more closely to an age in which progress has gained a strong ascendency over prejudice and in which persons and things are day by day finding their real level in lieu of their conventional value the same principles which have swept away traditional abuses and which are making rapid havoc among the revenues of sinecurists and stripping the thin tawdry veil from attractive superstitions are working as actively in literature as in society the credulity of one writer or the partiality of another finds as powerful a touchstone and as wholesome a chastisement in the healthy scepticism of a temperate class of antagonists as the dreams of conservatism or the impostures of pluralist sinecures in the church history and tradition whether of ancient or comparatively recent times are subjected to very different handling from that which the indulgence or credulity of former ages could allow mere statements are jealously watched and the motives of the writer form as important an ingredient in the analysis of his history as the facts he records probability is a powerful and troublesome test and it is by this troublesome standard that a large portion of historical evidence is sifted consistency is no less pertinacious and exacting in its demands in brief to write a history we must know more than mere facts human nature viewed under an induction of extended experience is the best help to the criticism of human history historical characters can only be estimated by the standard which human experience whether actual or traditionary has furnished to form correct views of individuals we must regard them as forming parts of a great wholewe must measure them by their relation to the mass of beings by whom they are surrounded and in contemplating the incidents in their lives or condition which tradition has handed down to us we must rather consider the general bearing of the whole narrative than the respective probability of its details it is unfortunate for us that of some of the greatest men we know least and talk most homer socrates and shakespere have perhaps contributed more to the intellectual enlightenment of mankind than any other three writers who could be named and yet the history of all three has given rise to a boundless ocean of discussion which has left us little save the option of choosing which theory or theories we will follow the personality of shakespere is perhaps the only thing in which critics will allow us to believe without controversy but upon everything else even down to the authorship of plays there is more or less of doubt and uncertainty of socrates we know as little as the contradictions of plato and xenophon will allow us to know he was one of the dramatis person in two dramas as unlike in principles as in style he appears as the enunciator of opinions as different in their tone as those of the writers who have handed them down when we have read plato or xenophon we think we know something of socrates when we have fairly read and examined both we feel convinced that we are something worse than ignorant it has been an easy and a popular expedient of late years to deny the personal or real existence of men and things whose life and condition were too much for our belief this systemwhich has often comforted the religious sceptic and substituted the consolations of strauss for those of the new testamenthas been of incalculable value to the historical theorists of the last and present centuries to question the existence of alexander the great would be a more excusable act than to believe in that of romulus to deny a fact related in herodotus because it is inconsistent with a theory developed from an assyrian inscription which no two scholars read in the same way is more pardonable than to believe in the goodnatured old king whom the elegant pen of florian has idealizednuma pompilius scepticism has attained its culminating point with respect to homer and the state of our homeric knowledge may be described as a free permission to believe any theory provided we throw overboard all written tradition concerning the author or authors of the iliad and odyssey what few authorities exist on the subject are summarily dismissed although the arguments appear to run in a circle this cannot be true because it is not true and that is not true because it cannot be true such seems to be the style in which testimony upon testimony statement upon statement is consigned to denial and oblivion it is however unfortunate that the professed biographies of homer are partly forgeries partly freaks of ingenuity and imagination in which truth is the requisite most wanting before taking a brief review of the homeric theory in its present conditions some notice must be taken of the treatise on the life of homer which has been attributed to herodotus according to this document the city of cum in olia was at an early period the seat of frequent immigrations from various parts of greece among the immigrants was menapolus the son of ithagenes although poor he married and the result of the union was a girl named crithes the girl was left an orphan at an early age under the guardianship of cleanax of argos it is to the indiscretion of this maiden that we are indebted for so much happiness homer was the first fruit of her juvenile frailty and received the name of melesigenes from having been born near the river meles in botia whither crithes had been transported in order to save her reputation at this time continues our narrative there lived at smyrna a man named phemius a teacher of literature and music who not being married engaged crithes to manage his household and spin the flax he received as the price of his scholastic labours so satisfactory was her performance of this task and so modest her conduct that he made proposals of marriage declaring himself as a further inducement willing to adopt her son who he asserted would become a clever man if he were carefully brought up they were married careful cultivation ripened the talents which nature had bestowed and melesigenes soon surpassed his schoolfellows in every attainment and when older rivalled his preceptor in wisdom phemius died leaving him sole heir to his property and his mother soon followed melesigenes carried on his adopted fathers school with great success exciting the admiration not only of the inhabitants of smyrna but also of the strangers whom the trade carried on there especially in the exportation of corn attracted to that city among these visitors one mentes from leucadia the modern santa maura who evinced a knowledge and intelligence rarely found in those times persuaded melesigenes to close his school and accompany him on his travels he promised not only to pay his expenses but to furnish him with a further stipend urging that while he was yet young it was fitting that he should see with his own eyes the countries and cities which might hereafter be the subjects of his discourses melesigenes consented and set out with his patron examining all the curiosities of the countries they visited and informing himself of everything by interrogating those whom he met we may also suppose that he wrote memoirs of all that he deemed worthy of preservation having set sail from tyrrhenia and iberia they reached ithaca here melesigenes who had already suffered in his eyes became much worse and mentes who was about to leave for leucadia left him to the medical superintendence of a friend of his named mentor the son of alcinor under his hospitable and intelligent host melesigenes rapidly became acquainted with the legends respecting ulysses which afterwards formed the subject of the odyssey the inhabitants of ithaca assert that it was here that melesigenes became blind but the colophomans make their city the seat of that misfortune he then returned to smyrna where he applied himself to the study of poetry but poverty soon drove him to cum having passed over the herman plain he arrived at neon teichos the new wall a colony of cum here his misfortunes and poetical talent gained him the friendship of one tychias an armourer and up to my time continued the author the inhabitants showed the place where he used to sit when giving a recitation of his verses and they greatly honoured the spot here also a poplar grew which they said had sprung up ever since melesigenes arrived but poverty still drove him on and he went by way of larissa as being the most convenient road here the cumans say he composed an epitaph on gordius king of phrygia which has however and with greater probability been attributed to cleobulus of lindus arrived at cum he frequented the converzationes of the old men and delighted all by the charms of his poetry encouraged by this favourable reception he declared that if they would allow him a public maintenance he would render their city most gloriously renowned they avowed their willingness to support him in the measure he proposed and procured him an audience in the council having made the speech with the purport of which our author has forgotten to acquaint us he retired and left them to debate respecting the answer to be given to his proposal the greater part of the assembly seemed favourable to the poets demand but one man observed that if they were to feed homers they would be encumbered with a multitude of useless people from this circumstance says the writer melesigenes acquired the name of homer for the cumans call blind men homers with a love of economy which shows how similar the world has always been in its treatment of literary men the pension was denied and the poet vented his disappointment in a wish that cuma might never produce a poet capable of giving it renown and glory at phoca homer was destined to experience another literary distress one thestorides who aimed at the reputation of poetical genius kept homer in his own house and allowed him a pittance on condition of the verses of the poet passing in his name having collected sufficient poetry to be profitable thestorides like some wouldbeliterary publishers neglected the man whose brains he had sucked and left him at his departure homer is said to have observed o thestorides of the many things hidden from the knowledge of man nothing is more unintelligible than the human heart homer continued his career of difficulty and distress until some chian merchants struck by the similarity of the verses they heard him recite acquainted him with the fact that thestorides was pursuing a profitable livelihood by the recital of the very same poems this at once determined him to set out for chios no vessel happened then to be setting sail thither but he found one ready to start for erythr a town of ionia which faces that island and he prevailed upon the seamen to allow him to accompany them having embarked he invoked a favourable wind and prayed that he might be able to expose the imposture of thestorides who by his breach of hospitality had drawn down the wrath of jove the hospitable at erythr homer fortunately met with a person who had known him in phoca by whose assistance he at length after some difficulty reached the little hamlet of pithys here he met with an adventure which we will continue in the words of our author having set out from pithys homer went on attracted by the cries of some goats that were pasturing the dogs barked on his approach and he cried out glaucus for that was the name of the goatherd heard his voice ran up quickly called off his dogs and drove them away from homer for some time he stood wondering how a blind man should have reached such a place alone and what could be his design in coming he then went up to him and inquired who he was and how he had come to desolate places and untrodden spots and of what he stood in need homer by recounting to him the whole history of his misfortunes moved him with compassion and he took him and led him to his cot and having lit a fire bade him sup the dogs instead of eating kept barking at the stranger according to their usual habit whereupon homer addressed glaucus thus o glaucus my friend prythee attend to my behest first give the dogs their supper at the doors of the hut for so it is better since whilst they watch nor thief nor wild beast will approach the fold glaucus was pleased with the advice and marvelled at its author having finished supper they banqueted afresh on conversation homer narrating his wanderings and telling of the cities he had visited at length they retired to rest but on the following morning glaucus resolved to go to his master and acquaint him with his meeting with homer having left the goats in charge of a fellowservant he left homer at home promising to return quickly having arrived at bolissus a place near the farm and finding his mate he told him the whole story respecting homer and his journey he paid little attention to what he said and blamed glaucus for his stupidity in taking in and feeding maimed and enfeebled persons however he bade him bring the stranger to him glaucus told homer what had taken place and bade him follow him assuring him that good fortune would be the result conversation soon showed that the stranger was a man of much cleverness and general knowledge and the chian persuaded him to remain and to undertake the charge of his children besides the satisfaction of driving the impostor thestorides from the island homer enjoyed considerable success as a teacher in the town of chios he established a school where he taught the precepts of poetry to this day says chandler the most curious remaining is that which has been named without reason the school of homer it is on the coast at some distance from the city northward and appears to have been an open temple of cybele formed on the top of a rock the shape is oval and in the centre is the image of the goddess the head and an arm wanting she is represented as usual sitting the chair has a lion carved on each side and on the back the area is bounded by a low rim or seat and about five yards over the whole is hewn out of the mountain is rude indistinct and probably of the most remote antiquity so successful was this school that homer realised a considerable fortune he married and had two daughters one of whom died single the other married a chian the following passage betrays the same tendency to connect the personages of the poems with the history of the poet which has already been mentioned in his poetical compositions homer displays great gratitude towards mentor of ithaca in the odyssey whose name he has inserted in his poem as the companion of ulysses in return for the care taken of him when afflicted with blindness he also testifies his gratitude to phemius who had given him both sustenance and instruction his celebrity continued to increase and many persons advised him to visit greece whither his reputation had now extended having it is said made some additions to his poems calculated to please the vanity of the athenians of whose city he had hitherto made no mention he sent out for samos here being recognized by a samian who had met with him in chios he was handsomely received and invited to join in celebrating the apaturian festival he recited some verses which gave great satisfaction and by singing the eiresione at the new moon festivals he earned a subsistence visiting the houses of the rich with whose children he was very popular in the spring he sailed for athens and arrived at the island of ios now ino where he fell extremely ill and died it is said that his death arose from vexation at not having been able to unravel an enigma proposed by some fishermens children such is in brief the substance of the earliest life of homer we possess and so broad are the evidences of its historical worthlessness that it is scarcely necessary to point them out in detail let us now consider some of the opinions to which a persevering patient and learnedbut by no means consistentseries of investigations has led in doing so i profess to bring forward statements not to vouch for their reasonableness or probability homer appeared the history of this poet and his works is lost in doubtful obscurity as is the history of many of the first minds who have done honour to humanity because they rose amidst darkness the majestic stream of his song blessing and fertilizing flows like the nile through many lands and nations and like the sources of the nile its fountains will ever remain concealed such are the words in which one of the most judicious german critics has eloquently described the uncertainty in which the whole of the homeric question is involved with no less truth and feeling he proceeds it seems here of chief importance to expect no more than the nature of things makes possible if the period of tradition in history is the region of twilight we should not expect in it perfect light the creations of genius always seem like miracles because they are for the most part created far out of the reach of observation if we were in possession of all the historical testimonies we never could wholly explain the origin of the iliad and the odyssey for their origin in all essential points must have remained the secret of the poet from this criticism which shows as much insight into the depths of human nature as into the minute wiredrawings of scholastic investigation let us pass on to the main question at issue was homer an individual or were the iliad and odyssey the result of an ingenious arrangement of fragments by earlier poets well has landor remarked some tell us there were twenty homers some deny that there was ever one it were idle and foolish to shake the contents of a vase in order to let them settle at last we are perpetually labouring to destroy our delights our composure our devotion to superior power of all the animals on earth we least know what is good for us my opinion is that what is best for us is our admiration of good no man living venerates homer more than i do but greatly as we admire the generous enthusiasm which rests contented with the poetry on which its best impulses had been nurtured and fostered without seeking to destroy the vividness of first impressions by minute analysisour editorial office compels us to give some attention to the doubts and difficulties with which the homeric question is beset and to entreat our reader for a brief period to prefer his judgment to his imagination and to condescend to dry details before however entering into particulars respecting the question of this unity of the homeric poems at least of the iliad i must express my sympathy with the sentiments expressed in the following remarks we cannot but think the universal admiration of its unity by the better the poetic age of greece almost conclusive testimony to its original composition it was not till the age of the grammarians that its primitive integrity was called in question nor is it injustice to assert that the minute and analytical spirit of a grammarian is not the best qualification for the profound feeling the comprehensive conception of an harmonious whole the most exquisite anatomist may be no judge of the symmetry of the human frame and we would take the opinion of chantrey or westmacott on the proportions and general beauty of a form rather than that of mr brodie or sir astley cooper there is some truth though some malicious exaggeration in the lines of pope the critic eyethat microscope of wit sees hairs and pores examines bit by bit how parts relate to parts or they to whole the bodys harmony the beaming soul are things which kuster burmann wasse shall see when mans whole frame is obvious to a flea long was the time which elapsed before any one dreamt of questioning the unity of the authorship of the homeric poems the grave and cautious thucydides quoted without hesitation the hymn to apollo the authenticity of which has been already disclaimed by modern critics longinus in an oft quoted passage merely expressed an opinion touching the comparative inferiority of the odyssey to the iliad and among a mass of ancient authors whose very names it would be tedious to detail no suspicion of the personal nonexistence of homer ever arose so far the voice of antiquity seems to be in favour of our early ideas on the subject let us now see what are the discoveries to which more modern investigations lay claim at the end of the seventeenth century doubts had begun to awaken on the subject and we find bentley remarking that homer wrote a sequel of songs and rhapsodies to be sung by himself for small comings and good cheer at festivals and other days of merriment these loose songs were not collected together in the form of an epic poem till about peisistratus time about five hundred years after two french writershedelin and perraultavowed a similar scepticism on the subject but it is in the scienza nuova of battista vico that we first meet with the germ of the theory subsequently defended by wolf with so much learning and acuteness indeed it is with the wolfian theory that we have chiefly to deal and with the following bold hypothesis which we will detail in the words of grote half a century ago the acute and valuable prolegomena of f a wolf turning to account the venetian scholia which had then been recently published first opened philosophical discussion as to the history of the homeric text a considerable part of that dissertation though by no means the whole is employed in vindicating the position previously announced by bentley amongst others that the separate constituent portions of the iliad and odyssey had not been cemented together into any compact body and unchangeable order until the days of peisistratus in the sixth century before christ as a step towards that conclusion wolf maintained that no written copies of either poem could be shown to have existed during the earlier times to which their composition is referred and that without writing neither the perfect symmetry of so complicated a work could have been originally conceived by any poet nor if realized by him transmitted with assurance to posterity the absence of easy and convenient writing such as must be indispensably supposed for long manuscripts among the early greeks was thus one of the points in wolfs case against the primitive integrity of the iliad and odyssey by nitzsch and other leading opponents of wolf the connection of the one with the other seems to have been accepted as he originally put it and it has been considered incumbent on those who defended the ancient aggregate character of the iliad and odyssey to maintain that they were written poems from the beginning to me it appears that the architectonic functions ascribed by wolf to peisistratus and his associates in reference to the homeric poems are nowise admissible but much would undoubtedly be gained towards that view of the question if it could be shown that in order to controvert it we were driven to the necessity of admitting long written poems in the ninth century before the christian ra few things in my opinion can be more improbable and mr payne knight opposed as he is to the wolfian hypothesis admits this no less than wolf himself the traces of writing in greece even in the seventh century before the christian ra are exceedingly trifling we have no remaining inscription earlier than the fortieth olympiad and the early inscriptions are rude and unskilfully executed nor can we even assure ourselves whether archilochus simonids of amorgus kallinus tyrtus xanthus and the other early elegiac and lyric poets committed their compositions to writing or at what time the practice of doing so became familiar the first positive ground which authorizes us to presume the existence of a manuscript of homer is in the famous ordinance of soln with regard to the rhapsodies at the panathena but for what length of time previously manuscripts had existed we are unable to say those who maintain the homeric poems to have been written from the beginning rest their case not upon positive proofs nor yet upon the existing habits of society with regard to poetryfor they admit generally that the iliad and odyssey were not read but recited and heardbut upon the supposed necessity that there must have been manuscripts to ensure the preservation of the poemsthe unassisted memory of reciters being neither sufficient nor trustworthy but here we only escape a smaller difficulty by running into a greater for the existence of trained bards gifted with extraordinary memory is far less astonishing than that of long manuscripts in an age essentially nonreading and nonwriting and when even suitable instruments and materials for the process are not obvious moreover there is a strong positive reason for believing that the bard was under no necessity of refreshing his memory by consulting a manuscript for if such had been the fact blindness would have been a disqualification for the profession which we know that it was not as well from the example of demodokus in the odyssey as from that of the blind bard of chios in the hymn to the delian apollo whom thucydides as well as the general tenor of grecian legend identifies with homer himself the author of that hymn be he who he may could never have described a blind man as attaining the utmost perfection in his art if he had been conscious that the memory of the bard was only maintained by constant reference to the manuscript in his chest the loss of the digamma that crux of critics that quicksand upon which even the acumen of bentley was shipwrecked seems to prove beyond a doubt that the pronunciation of the greek language had undergone a considerable change now it is certainly difficult to suppose that the homeric poems could have suffered by this change had written copies been preserved if chaucers poetry for instance had not been written it could only have come down to us in a softened form more like the effeminate version of dryden than the rough quaint noble original at what period continues grote these poems or indeed any other greek poems first began to be written must be matter of conjecture though there is ground for assurance that it was before the time of soln if in the absence of evidence we may venture upon naming any more determinate period the question at once suggests itself what were the purposes which in that state of society a manuscript at its first commencement must have been intended to answer for whom was a written iliad necessary not for the rhapsodes for with them it was not only planted in the memory but also interwoven with the feelings and conceived in conjunction with all those flexions and intonations of voice pauses and other oral artifices which were required for emphatic delivery and which the naked manuscript could never reproduce not for the general publicthey were accustomed to receive it with its rhapsodic delivery and with its accompaniments of a solemn and crowded festival the only persons for whom the written iliad would be suitable would be a select few studious and curious men a class of readers capable of analyzing the complicated emotions which they had experienced as hearers in the crowd and who would on perusing the written words realize in their imaginations a sensible portion of the impression communicated by the reciter incredible as the statement may seem in an age like the present there is in all early societies and there was in early greece a time when no such reading class existed if we could discover at what time such a class first began to be formed we should be able to make a guess at the time when the old epic poems were first committed to writing now the period which may with the greatest probability be fixed upon as having first witnessed the formation even of the narrowest reading class in greece is the middle of the seventh century before the christian ra bc to bc the age of terpander kallinus archilochus simonids of amorgus c i ground this supposition on the change then operated in the character and tendencies of grecian poetry and musicthe elegiac and the iambic measures having been introduced as rivals to the primitive hexameter and poetical compositions having been transferred from the epical past to the affairs of present and real life such a change was important at a time when poetry was the only known mode of publication to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable yet the nearest approaching to the sense it argued a new way of looking at the old epical treasures of the people as well as a thirst for new poetical effect and the men who stood forward in it may well be considered as desirous to study and competent to criticize from their own individual point of view the written words of the homeric rhapsodies just as we are told that kallinus both noticed and eulogized the thebas as the production of homer there seems therefore ground for conjecturing that for the use of this newlyformed and important but very narrow class manuscripts of the homeric poems and other old epicsthe thebas and the cypria as well as the iliad and the odysseybegan to be compiled towards the middle of the seventh century bc and the opening of egypt to grecian commerce which took place about the same period would furnish increased facilities for obtaining the requisite papyrus to write upon a reading class when once formed would doubtless slowly increase and the number of manuscripts along with it so that before the time of soln fifty years afterwards both readers and manuscripts though still comparatively few might have attained a certain recognized authority and formed a tribunal of reference against the carelessness of individual rhapsodes but even peisistratus has not been suffered to remain in possession of the credit and we cannot help feeling the force of the following observations there are several incidental circumstances which in our opinion throw some suspicion over the whole history of the peisistratid compilation at least over the theory that the iliad was cast into its present stately and harmonious form by the directions of the athenian ruler if the great poets who flourished at the bright period of grecian song of which alas we have inherited little more than the fame and the faint echo if stesichorus anacreon and simonids were employed in the noble task of compiling the iliad and odyssey so much must have been done to arrange to connect to harmonize that it is almost incredible that stronger marks of athenian manufacture should not remain whatever occasional anomalies may be detected anomalies which no doubt arise out of our own ignorance of the language of the homeric age however the irregular use of the digamma may have perplexed our bentleys to whom the name of helen is said to have caused as much disquiet and distress as the fair one herself among the heroes of her age however mr knight may have failed in reducing the homeric language to its primitive form however finally the attic dialect may not have assumed all its more marked and distinguishing characteristicsstill it is difficult to suppose that the language particularly in the joinings and transitions and connecting parts should not more clearly betray the incongruity between the more ancient and modern forms of expression it is not quite in character with such a period to imitate an antique style in order to piece out an imperfect poem in the character of the original as sir walter scott has done in his continuation of sir tristram if however not even such faint and indistinct traces of athenian compilation are discoverable in the language of the poems the total absence of athenian national feeling is perhaps no less worthy of observation in later and it may fairly be suspected in earlier times the athenians were more than ordinarily jealous of the fame of their ancestors but amid all the traditions of the glories of early greece embodied in the iliad the athenians play a most subordinate and insignificant part even the few passages which relate to their ancestors mr knight suspects to be interpolations it is possible indeed that in its leading outline the iliad may be true to historic fact that in the great maritime expedition of western greece against the rival and halfkindred empire of the laomedontiad the chieftain of thessaly from his valour and the number of his forces may have been the most important ally of the peloponnesian sovereign the preeminent value of the ancient poetry on the trojan war may thus have forced the national feeling of the athenians to yield to their taste the songs which spoke of their own great ancestor were no doubt of far inferior sublimity and popularity or at first sight a theseid would have been much more likely to have emanated from an athenian synod of compilers of ancient song than an achilleid or an olysseid could france have given birth to a tasso tancred would have been the hero of the jerusalem if however the homeric ballads as they are sometimes called which related the wrath of achilles with all its direful consequences were so far superior to the rest of the poetic cycle as to admit no rivalryit is still surprising that throughout the whole poem the callida junctura should never betray the workmanship of an athenian hand and that the national spirit of a race who have at a later period not inaptly been compared to our self admiring neighbours the french should submit with lofty self denial to the almost total exclusion of their own ancestorsor at least to the questionable dignity of only having produced a leader tolerably skilled in the military tactics of his age to return to the wolfian theory while it is to be confessed that wolfs objections to the primitive integrity of the iliad and odyssey have never been wholly got over we cannot help discovering that they have failed to enlighten us as to any substantial point and that the difficulties with which the whole subject is beset are rather augmented than otherwise if we admit his hypothesis nor is lachmanns modification of his theory any better he divides the first twentytwo books of the iliad into sixteen different songs and treats as ridiculous the belief that their amalgamation into one regular poem belongs to a period earlier than the age of peisistratus this as grote observes explains the gaps and contradictions in the narrative but it explains nothing else moreover we find no contradictions warranting this belief and the socalled sixteen poets concur in getting rid of the following leading men in the first battle after the secession of achilles elphenor chief of the eubans tlepolemus of the rhodians pandarus of the lycians odius of the halizonians pirous and acamas of the thracians none of these heroes again make their appearance and we can but agree with colonel mure that it seems strange that any number of independent poets should have so harmoniously dispensed with the services of all six in the sequel the discrepancy by which pylmenes who is represented as dead in the fifth book weeps at his sons funeral in the thirteenth can only be regarded as the result of an interpolation grote although not very distinct in stating his own opinions on the subject has done much to clearly show the incongruity of the wolfian theory and of lachmanns modifications with the character of peisistratus but he has also shown and we think with equal success that the two questions relative to the primitive unity of these poems or supposing that impossible the unison of these parts by peisistratus and not before his time are essentially distinct in short a man may believe the iliad to have been put together out of preexisting songs without recognising the age of peisistratus as the period of its first compilation the friends or literary employs of peisistratus must have found an iliad that was already ancient and the silence of the alexandrine critics respecting the peisistratic recension goes far to prove that among the numerous manuscripts they examined this was either wanting or thought unworthy of attention moreover he continues the whole tenor of the poems themselves confirms what is here remarked there is nothing either in the iliad or odyssey which savours of modernism applying that term to the age of peisistratusnothing which brings to our view the alterations brought about by two centuries in the greek language the coined money the habits of writing and reading the despotisms and republican governments the close military array the improved construction of ships the amphiktyonic convocations the mutual frequentation of religious festivals the oriental and egyptian veins of religion c familiar to the latter epoch these alterations onomakritus and the other literary friends of peisistratus could hardly have failed to notice even without design had they then for the first time undertaken the task of piecing together many self existent epics into one large aggregate everything in the two great homeric poems both in substance and in language belongs to an age two or three centuries earlier than peisistratus indeed even the interpolations or those passages which on the best grounds are pronounced to be such betray no trace of the sixth century before christ and may well have been heard by archilochus and kallinusin some cases even by arktinus and hesiodas genuine homeric matter as far as the evidences on the case as well internal as external enable us to judge we seem warranted in believing that the iliad and odyssey were recited substantially as they now stand always allowing for partial divergences of text and interpolations in bc our first trustworthy mark of grecian time and this ancient date let it be added as it is the bestauthenticated fact so it is also the most important attribute of the homeric poems considered in reference to grecian history for they thus afford us an insight into the antihistorical character of the greeks enabling us to trace the subsequent forward march of the nation and to seize instructive contrasts between their former and their later condition on the whole i am inclined to believe that the labours of peisistratus were wholly of an editorial character although i must confess that i can lay down nothing respecting the extent of his labours at the same time so far from believing that the composition or primary arrangement of these poems in their present form was the work of peisistratus i am rather persuaded that the fine taste and elegant mind of that athenian would lead him to preserve an ancient and traditional order of the poems rather than to patch and reconstruct them according to a fanciful hypothesis i will not repeat the many discussions respecting whether the poems were written or not or whether the art of writing was known in the time of their reputed author suffice it to say that the more we read the less satisfied we are upon either subject i cannot however help thinking that the story which attributes the preservation of these poems to lycurgus is little else than a version of the same story as that of peisistratus while its historical probability must be measured by that of many others relating to the spartan confucius i will conclude this sketch of the homeric theories with an attempt made by an ingenious friend to unite them into something like consistency it is as follows no doubt the common soldiers of that age had like the common sailors of some fifty years ago some one qualified to discourse in excellent music among them many of these like those of the negroes in the united states were extemporaneous and allusive to events passing around them but what was passing around them the grand events of a spiritstirring war occurrences likely to impress themselves as the mystical legends of former times had done upon their memory besides which a retentive memory was deemed a virtue of the first water and was cultivated accordingly in those ancient times ballads at first and down to the beginning of the war with troy were merely recitations with an intonation then followed a species of recitative probably with an intoned burden tune next followed as it aided the memory considerably it was at this period about four hundred years after the war that a poet flourished of the name of melesigenes or monides but most probably the former he saw that these ballads might be made of great utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the social position of hellas and as a collection he published these lays connecting them by a tale of his own this poem now exists under the title of the odyssea the author however did not affix his own name to the poem which in fact was great part of it remodelled from the archaic dialect of crete in which tongue the ballads were found by him he therefore called it the poem of homeros or the collector but this is rather a proof of his modesty and talent than of his mere drudging arrangement of other peoples ideas for as grote has finely observed arguing for the unity of authorship a great poet might have recast preexisting separate songs into one comprehensive whole but no mere arrangers or compilers would be competent to do so while employed on the wild legend of odysseus he met with a ballad recording the quarrel of achilles and agamemnon his noble mind seized the hint that there presented itself and the achilles grew under his hand unity of design however caused him to publish the poem under the same pseudonyme as his former work and the disjointed lays of the ancient bards were joined together like those relating to the cid into a chronicle history named the iliad melesigenes knew that the poem was destined to be a lasting one and so it has proved but first the poems were destined to undergo many vicissitudes and corruptions by the people who took to singing them in the streets assemblies and agoras however soln first and then peisistratus and afterwards aristoteles and others revised the poems and restored the works of melesigenes homeros to their original integrity in a great measure having thus given some general notion of the strange theories which have developed themselves respecting this most interesting subject i must still express my conviction as to the unity of the authorship of the homeric poems to deny that many corruptions and interpolations disfigure them and that the intrusive hand of the poetasters may here and there have inflicted a wound more serious than the negligence of the copyist would be an absurd and captious assumption but it is to a higher criticism that we must appeal if we would either understand or enjoy these poems in maintaining the authenticity and personality of their one author be he homer or melesigenes quocunque nomine vocari eum jus fasque sit i feel conscious that while the whole weight of historical evidence is against the hypothesis which would assign these great works to a plurality of authors the most powerful internal evidence and that which springs from the deepest and most immediate impulse of the soul also speaks eloquently to the contrary the minuti of verbal criticism i am far from seeking to despise indeed considering the character of some of my own books such an attempt would be gross inconsistency but while i appreciate its importance in a philological view i am inclined to set little store on its sthetic value especially in poetry three parts of the emendations made upon poets are mere alterations some of which had they been suggested to the author by his mcenas or africanus he would probably have adopted moreover those who are most exact in laying down rules of verbal criticism and interpretation are often least competent to carry out their own precepts grammarians are not poets by profession but may be so per accidens i do not at this moment remember two emendations on homer calculated to substantially improve the poetry of a passage although a mass of remarks from herodotus down to loewe have given us the history of a thousand minute points without which our greek knowledge would be gloomy and jejune but it is not on words only that grammarians mere grammarians will exercise their elaborate and often tiresome ingenuity binding down an heroic or dramatic poet to the block upon which they have previously dissected his words and sentences they proceed to use the axe and the pruning knife by wholesale and inconsistent in everything but their wish to make out a case of unlawful affiliation they cut out book after book passage after passage till the author is reduced to a collection of fragments or till those who fancied they possessed the works of some great man find that they have been put off with a vile counterfeit got up at second hand if we compare the theories of knight wolf lachmann and others we shall feel better satisfied of the utter uncertainty of criticism than of the apocryphal position of homer one rejects what another considers the turningpoint of his theory one cuts a supposed knot by expunging what another would explain by omitting something else nor is this morbid species of sagacity by any means to be looked upon as a literary novelty justus lipsius a scholar of no ordinary skill seems to revel in the imaginary discovery that the tragedies attributed to seneca are by four different authors now i will venture to assert that these tragedies are so uniform not only in their borrowed phraseologya phraseology with which writers like boethius and saxo grammaticus were more charmed than ourselvesin their freedom from real poetry and last but not least in an ultrarefined and consistent abandonment of good taste that few writers of the present day would question the capabilities of the same gentleman be he seneca or not to produce not only these but a great many more equally bad with equal sagacity father hardouin astonished the world with the startling announcement that the neid of virgil and the satires of horace were literary deceptions now without wishing to say one word of disrespect against the industry and learningnay the refined acutenesswhich scholars like wolf have bestowed upon this subject i must express my fears that many of our modern homeric theories will become matter for the surprise and entertainment rather than the instruction of posterity nor can i help thinking that the literary history of more recent times will account for many points of difficulty in the transmission of the iliad and odyssey to a period so remote from that of their first creation i have already expressed my belief that the labours of peisistratus were of a purely editorial character and there seems no more reason why corrupt and imperfect editions of homer may not have been abroad in his day than that the poems of valerius flaccus and tibullus should have given so much trouble to poggio scaliger and others but after all the main fault in all the homeric theories is that they demand too great a sacrifice of those feelings to which poetry most powerfully appeals and which are its most fitting judges the ingenuity which has sought to rob us of the name and existence of homer does too much violence to that inward emotion which makes our whole soul yearn with love and admiration for the blind bard of chios to believe the author of the iliad a mere compiler is to degrade the powers of human invention to elevate analytical judgment at the expense of the most ennobling impulses of the soul and to forget the ocean in the contemplation of a polypus there is a catholicity so to speak in the very name of homer our faith in the author of the iliad may be a mistaken one but as yet nobody has taught us a better while however i look upon the belief in homer as one that has nature herself for its mainspring while i can join with old ennius in believing in homer as the ghost who like some patron saint hovers round the bed of the poet and even bestows rare gifts from that wealth of imagination which a host of imitators could not exhauststill i am far from wishing to deny that the author of these great poems found a rich fund of tradition a wellstocked mythical storehouse from whence he might derive both subject and embellishment but it is one thing to use existing romances in the embellishment of a poem another to patch up the poem itself from such materials what consistency of style and execution can be hoped for from such an attempt or rather what bad taste and tedium will not be the infallible result a blending of popular legends and a free use of the songs of other bards are features perfectly consistent with poetical originality in fact the most original writer is still drawing upon outward impressionsnay even his own thoughts are a kind of secondary agents which support and feed the impulses of imagination but unless there be some grand pervading principlesome invisible yet most distinctly stamped archetypus of the great whole a poem like the iliad can never come to the birth traditions the most picturesque episodes the most pathetic local associations teeming with the thoughts of gods and great men may crowd in one mighty vision or reveal themselves in more substantial forms to the mind of the poet but except the power to create a grand whole to which these shall be but as details and embellishments be present we shall have nought but a scrapbook a parterre filled with flowers and weeds strangling each other in their wild redundancy we shall have a cento of rags and tatters which will require little acuteness to detect sensible as i am of the difficulty of disproving a negative and aware as i must be of the weighty grounds there are for opposing my belief it still seems to me that the homeric question is one that is reserved for a higher criticism than it has often obtained we are not by nature intended to know all things still less to compass the powers by which the greatest blessings of life have been placed at our disposal were faith no virtue then we might indeed wonder why god willed our ignorance on any matter but we are too well taught the contrary lesson and it seems as though our faith should be especially tried touching the men and the events which have wrought most influence upon the condition of humanity and there is a kind of sacredness attached to the memory of the great and the good which seems to bid us repulse the scepticism which would allegorize their existence into a pleasing apologue and measure the giants of intellect by an homeopathic dynameter long and habitual reading of homer appears to familiarize our thoughts even to his incongruities or rather if we read in a right spirit and with a heartfelt appreciation we are too much dazzled too deeply wrapped in admiration of the whole to dwell upon the minute spots which mere analysis can discover in reading an heroic poem we must transform ourselves into heroes of the time being we in imagination must fight over the same battles woo the same loves burn with the same sense of injury as an achilles or a hector and if we can but attain this degree of enthusiasm and less enthusiasm will scarcely suffice for the reading of homer we shall feel that the poems of homer are not only the work of one writer but of the greatest writer that ever touched the hearts of men by the power of song and it was this supposed unity of authorship which gave these poems their powerful influence over the minds of the men of old heeren who is evidently little disposed in favour of modern theories finely observes it was homer who formed the character of the greek nation no poet has ever as a poet exercised a similar influence over his countrymen prophets lawgivers and sages have formed the character of other nations it was reserved to a poet to form that of the greeks this is a feature in their character which was not wholly erased even in the period of their degeneracy when lawgivers and sages appeared in greece the work of the poet had already been accomplished and they paid homage to his superior genius he held up before his nation the mirror in which they were to behold the world of gods and heroes no less than of feeble mortals and to behold them reflected with purity and truth his poems are founded on the first feeling of human nature on the love of children wife and country on that passion which outweighs all others the love of glory his songs were poured forth from a breast which sympathized with all the feelings of man and therefore they enter and will continue to enter every breast which cherishes the same sympathies if it is granted to his immortal spirit from another heaven than any of which he dreamed on earth to look down on his race to see the nations from the fields of asia to the forests of hercynia performing pilgrimages to the fountain which his magic wand caused to flow if it is permitted to him to view the vast assemblage of grand of elevated of glorious productions which had been called into being by means of his songs wherever his immortal spirit may reside this alone would suffice to complete his happiness can we contemplate that ancient monument on which the apotheosis of homer is depictured and not feel how much of pleasing association how much that appeals most forcibly and most distinctly to our minds is lost by the admittance of any theory but our old tradition the more we read and the more we thinkthink as becomes the readers of homerthe more rooted becomes the conviction that the father of poetry gave us this rich inheritance whole and entire whatever were the means of its preservation let us rather be thankful for the treasury of taste and eloquence thus laid open to our use than seek to make it a mere centre around which to drive a series of theories whose wildness is only equalled by their inconsistency with each other as the hymns and some other poems usually ascribed to homer are not included in popes translation i will content myself with a brief account of the battle of the frogs and mice from the pen of a writer who has done it full justice this poem says coleridge is a short mockheroic of ancient date the text varies in different editions and is obviously disturbed and corrupt to a great degree it is commonly said to have been a juvenile essay of homers genius others have attributed it to the same pigrees mentioned above and whose reputation for humour seems to have invited the appropriation of any piece of ancient wit the author of which was uncertain so little did the greeks before the age of the ptolemies know or care about that department of criticism employed in determining the genuineness of ancient writings as to this little poem being a youthful profusion of homer it seems sufficient to say that from the beginning to the end it is a plain and palpable parody not only of the general spirit but of the numerous passages of the iliad itself and even if no such intention to parody were discernible in it the objection would still remain that to suppose a work of mere burlesque to be the primary effort of poetry in a simple age seems to reverse that order in the development of national taste which the history of every other people in europe and of many in asia has almost ascertained to be a law of the human mind it is in a state of society much more refined and permanent than that described in the iliad that any popularity would attend such a ridicule of war and the gods as is contained in this poem and the fact of there having existed three other poems of the same kind attributed for aught we can see with as much reason to homer is a strong inducement to believe that none of them were of the homeric age knight infers from the usage of the word deltos writing tablet instead of skin which according to herod was the material employed by the asiatic greeks for that purpose that this poem was another offspring of attic ingenuity and generally that the familiar mention of the cock v is a strong argument against so ancient a date for its composition having thus given a brief account of the poems comprised in popes design i will now proceed to make a few remarks on his translation and on my own purpose in the present edition pope was not a grecian his whole education had been irregular and his earliest acquaintance with the poet was through the version of ogilby it is not too much to say that his whole work bears the impress of a disposition to be satisfied with the general sense rather than to dive deeply into the minute and delicate features of language hence his whole work is to be looked upon rather as an elegant paraphrase than a translation there are to be sure certain conventional anecdotes which prove that pope consulted various friends whose classical attainments were sounder than his own during the undertaking but it is probable that these examinations were the result rather of the contradictory versions already existing than of a desire to make a perfect transcript of the original and in those days what is called literal translation was less cultivated than at present if something like the general sense could be decorated with the easy gracefulness of a practised poet if the charms of metrical cadence and a pleasing fluency could be made consistent with a fair interpretation of the poets meaning his words were less jealously sought for and those who could read so good a poem as popes iliad had fair reason to be satisfied it would be absurd therefore to test popes translation by our own advancing knowledge of the original text we must be content to look at it as a most delightful work in itselfa work which is as much a part of english literature as homer himself is of greek we must not be torn from our kindly associations with the old iliad that once was our most cherished companion or our most lookedfor prize merely because buttmann loewe and liddell have made us so much more accurate as to being an adjective and not a substantive far be it from us to defend the faults of pope especially when we think of chapmans fine bold rough old englishfar be it from us to hold up his translation as what a translation of homer might be but we can still dismiss popes iliad to the hands of our readers with the consciousness that they must have read a very great number of books before they have read its fellow as to the notes accompanying the present volume they are drawn up without pretension and mainly with the view of helping the general reader having some little time since translated all the works of homer for another publisher i might have brought a large amount of accumulated matter sometimes of a critical character to bear upon the text but popes version was no field for such a display and my purpose was to touch briefly on antiquarian or mythological allusions to notice occasionally some departures from the original and to give a few parallel passages from our english homer milton in the latter task i cannot pretend to novelty but i trust that my other annotations while utterly disclaiming high scholastic views will be found to convey as much as is wanted at least as far as the necessary limits of these volumes could be expected to admit to write a commentary on homer is not my present aim but if i have made popes translation a little more entertaining and instructive to a mass of miscellaneous readers i shall consider my wishes satisfactorily accomplished theodore alois buckley christ church popes preface to the iliad of homer homer is universally allowed to have had the greatest invention of any writer whatever the praise of judgment virgil has justly contested with him and others may have their pretensions as to particular excellences but his invention remains yet unrivalled nor is it a wonder if he has ever been acknowledged the greatest of poets who most excelled in that which is the very foundation of poetry it is the invention that in different degrees distinguishes all great geniuses the utmost stretch of human study learning and industry which masters everything besides can never attain to this it furnishes art with all her materials and without it judgment itself can at best but steal wisely for art is only like a prudent steward that lives on managing the riches of nature whatever praises may be given to works of judgment there is not even a single beauty in them to which the invention must not contribute as in the most regular gardens art can only reduce beauties of nature to more regularity and such a figure which the common eye may better take in and is therefore more entertained with and perhaps the reason why common critics are inclined to prefer a judicious and methodical genius to a great and fruitful one is because they find it easier for themselves to pursue their observations through a uniform and bounded walk of art than to comprehend the vast and various extent of nature our authors work is a wild paradise where if we cannot see all the beauties so distinctly as in an ordered garden it is only because the number of them is infinitely greater it is like a copious nursery which contains the seeds and first productions of every kind out of which those who followed him have but selected some particular plants each according to his fancy to cultivate and beautify if some things are too luxuriant it is owing to the richness of the soil and if others are not arrived to perfection or maturity it is only because they are overrun and oppressed by those of a stronger nature it is to the strength of this amazing invention we are to attribute that unequalled fire and rapture which is so forcible in homer that no man of a true poetical spirit is master of himself while he reads him what he writes is of the most animated nature imaginable every thing moves every thing lives and is put in action if a council be called or a battle fought you are not coldly informed of what was said or done as from a third person the reader is hurried out of himself by the force of the poets imagination and turns in one place to a hearer in another to a spectator the course of his verses resembles that of the army he describes they pour along like a fire that sweeps the whole earth before it it is however remarkable that his fancy which is everywhere vigorous is not discovered immediately at the beginning of his poem in its fullest splendour it grows in the progress both upon himself and others and becomes on fire like a chariotwheel by its own rapidity exact disposition just thought correct elocution polished numbers may have been found in a thousand but this poetic fire this vivida vis animi in a very few even in works where all those are imperfect or neglected this can overpower criticism and make us admire even while we disapprove nay where this appears though attended with absurdities it brightens all the rubbish about it till we see nothing but its own splendour this fire is discerned in virgil but discerned as through a glass reflected from homer more shining than fierce but everywhere equal and constant in lucan and statius it bursts out in sudden short and interrupted flashes in milton it glows like a furnace kept up to an uncommon ardour by the force of art in shakspeare it strikes before we are aware like an accidental fire from heaven but in homer and in him only it burns everywhere clearly and everywhere irresistibly i shall here endeavour to show how this vast invention exerts itself in a manner superior to that of any poet through all the main constituent parts of his work as it is the great and peculiar characteristic which distinguishes him from all other authors this strong and ruling faculty was like a powerful star which in the violence of its course drew all things within its vortex it seemed not enough to have taken in the whole circle of arts and the whole compass of nature to supply his maxims and reflections all the inward passions and affections of mankind to furnish his characters and all the outward forms and images of things for his descriptions but wanting yet an ampler sphere to expatiate in he opened a new and boundless walk for his imagination and created a world for himself in the invention of fable that which aristotle calls the soul of poetry was first breathed into it by homer i shall begin with considering him in his part as it is naturally the first and i speak of it both as it means the design of a poem and as it is taken for fiction fable may be divided into the probable the allegorical and the marvellous the probable fable is the recital of such actions as though they did not happen yet might in the common course of nature or of such as though they did became fables by the additional episodes and manner of telling them of this sort is the main story of an epic poem the return of ulysses the settlement of the trojans in italy or the like that of the iliad is the anger of achilles the most short and single subject that ever was chosen by any poet yet this he has supplied with a vaster variety of incidents and events and crowded with a greater number of councils speeches battles and episodes of all kinds than are to be found even in those poems whose schemes are of the utmost latitude and irregularity the action is hurried on with the most vehement spirit and its whole duration employs not so much as fifty days virgil for want of so warm a genius aided himself by taking in a more extensive subject as well as a greater length of time and contracting the design of both homers poems into one which is yet but a fourth part as large as his the other epic poets have used the same practice but generally carried it so far as to superinduce a multiplicity of fables destroy the unity of action and lose their readers in an unreasonable length of time nor is it only in the main design that they have been unable to add to his invention but they have followed him in every episode and part of story if he has given a regular catalogue of an army they all draw up their forces in the same order if he has funeral games for patroclus virgil has the same for anchises and statius rather than omit them destroys the unity of his actions for those of archemorus if ulysses visit the shades the neas of virgil and scipio of silius are sent after him if he be detained from his return by the allurements of calypso so is neas by dido and rinaldo by armida if achilles be absent from the army on the score of a quarrel through half the poem rinaldo must absent himself just as long on the like account if he gives his hero a suit of celestial armour virgil and tasso make the same present to theirs virgil has not only observed this close imitation of homer but where he had not led the way supplied the want from other greek authors thus the story of sinon and the taking of troy was copied says macrobius almost word for word from pisander as the loves of dido and neas are taken from those of medea and jason in apollonius and several others in the same manner to proceed to the allegorical fableif we reflect upon those innumerable knowledges those secrets of nature and physical philosophy which homer is generally supposed to have wrapped up in his allegories what a new and ample scene of wonder may this consideration afford us how fertile will that imagination appear which was able to clothe all the properties of elements the qualifications of the mind the virtues and vices in forms and persons and to introduce them into actions agreeable to the nature of the things they shadowed this is a field in which no succeeding poets could dispute with homer and whatever commendations have been allowed them on this head are by no means for their invention in having enlarged his circle but for their judgment in having contracted it for when the mode of learning changed in the following ages and science was delivered in a plainer manner it then became as reasonable in the more modern poets to lay it aside as it was in homer to make use of it and perhaps it was no unhappy circumstance for virgil that there was not in his time that demand upon him of so great an invention as might be capable of furnishing all those allegorical parts of a poem the marvellous fable includes whatever is supernatural and especially the machines of the gods if homer was not the first who introduced the deities as herodotus imagines into the religion of greece he seems the first who brought them into a system of machinery for poetry and such a one as makes its greatest importance and dignity for we find those authors who have been offended at the literal notion of the gods constantly laying their accusation against homer as the chief support of it but whatever cause there might be to blame his machines in a philosophical or religious view they are so perfect in the poetic that mankind have been ever since contented to follow them none have been able to enlarge the sphere of poetry beyond the limits he has set every attempt of this nature has proved unsuccessful and after all the various changes of times and religions his gods continue to this day the gods of poetry we come now to the characters of his persons and here we shall find no author has ever drawn so many with so visible and surprising a variety or given us such lively and affecting impressions of them every one has something so singularly his own that no painter could have distinguished them more by their features than the poet has by their manners nothing can be more exact than the distinctions he has observed in the different degrees of virtues and vices the single quality of courage is wonderfully diversified in the several characters of the iliad that of achilles is furious and intractable that of diomede forward yet listening to advice and subject to command that of ajax is heavy and selfconfiding of hector active and vigilant the courage of agamemnon is inspirited by love of empire and ambition that of menelaus mixed with softness and tenderness for his people we find in idomeneus a plain direct soldier in sarpedon a gallant and generous one nor is this judicious and astonishing diversity to be found only in the principal quality which constitutes the main of each character but even in the under parts of it to which he takes care to give a tincture of that principal one for example the main characters of ulysses and nestor consist in wisdom and they are distinct in this that the wisdom of one is artificial and various of the other natural open and regular but they have besides characters of courage and this quality also takes a different turn in each from the difference of his prudence for one in the war depends still upon caution the other upon experience it would be endless to produce instances of these kinds the characters of virgil are far from striking us in this open manner they lie in a great degree hidden and undistinguished and where they are marked most evidently affect us not in proportion to those of homer his characters of valour are much alike even that of turnus seems no way peculiar but as it is in a superior degree and we see nothing that differences the courage of mnestheus from that of sergestus cloanthus or the rest in like manner it may be remarked of statiuss heroes that an air of impetuosity runs through them all the same horrid and savage courage appears in his capaneus tydeus hippomedon c they have a parity of character which makes them seem brothers of one family i believe when the reader is led into this tract of reflection if he will pursue it through the epic and tragic writers he will be convinced how infinitely superior in this point the invention of homer was to that of all others the speeches are to be considered as they flow from the characters being perfect or defective as they agree or disagree with the manners of those who utter them as there is more variety of characters in the iliad so there is of speeches than in any other poem everything in it has manner as aristotle expresses it that is everything is acted or spoken it is hardly credible in a work of such length how small a number of lines are employed in narration in virgil the dramatic part is less in proportion to the narrative and the speeches often consist of general reflections or thoughts which might be equally just in any persons mouth upon the same occasion as many of his persons have no apparent characters so many of his speeches escape being applied and judged by the rule of propriety we oftener think of the author himself when we read virgil than when we are engaged in homer all which are the effects of a colder invention that interests us less in the action described homer makes us hearers and virgil leaves us readers if in the next place we take a view of the sentiments the same presiding faculty is eminent in the sublimity and spirit of his thoughts longinus has given his opinion that it was in this part homer principally excelled what were alone sufficient to prove the grandeur and excellence of his sentiments in general is that they have so remarkable a parity with those of the scripture duport in his gnomologia homerica has collected innumerable instances of this sort and it is with justice an excellent modern writer allows that if virgil has not so many thoughts that are low and vulgar he has not so many that are sublime and noble and that the roman author seldom rises into very astonishing sentiments where he is not fired by the iliad if we observe his descriptions images and similes we shall find the invention still predominant to what else can we ascribe that vast comprehension of images of every sort where we see each circumstance of art and individual of nature summoned together by the extent and fecundity of his imagination to which all things in their various views presented themselves in an instant and had their impressions taken off to perfection at a heat nay he not only gives us the full prospects of things but several unexpected peculiarities and side views unobserved by any painter but homer nothing is so surprising as the descriptions of his battles which take up no less than half the iliad and are supplied with so vast a variety of incidents that no one bears a likeness to another such different kinds of deaths that no two heroes are wounded in the same manner and such a profusion of noble ideas that every battle rises above the last in greatness horror and confusion it is certain there is not near that number of images and descriptions in any epic poet though every one has assisted himself with a great quantity out of him and it is evident of virgil especially that he has scarce any comparisons which are not drawn from his master if we descend from hence to the expression we see the bright imagination of homer shining out in the most enlivened forms of it we acknowledge him the father of poetical diction the first who taught that language of the gods to men his expression is like the colouring of some great masters which discovers itself to be laid on boldly and executed with rapidity it is indeed the strongest and most glowing imaginable and touched with the greatest spirit aristotle had reason to say he was the only poet who had found out living words there are in him more daring figures and metaphors than in any good author whatever an arrow is impatient to be on the wing a weapon thirsts to drink the blood of an enemy and the like yet his expression is never too big for the sense but justly great in proportion to it it is the sentiment that swells and fills out the diction which rises with it and forms itself about it for in the same degree that a thought is warmer an expression will be brighter as that is more strong this will become more perspicuous like glass in the furnace which grows to a greater magnitude and refines to a greater clearness only as the breath within is more powerful and the heat more intense to throw his language more out of prose homer seems to have affected the compound epithets this was a sort of composition peculiarly proper to poetry not only as it heightened the diction but as it assisted and filled the numbers with greater sound and pomp and likewise conduced in some measure to thicken the images on this last consideration i cannot but attribute these also to the fruitfulness of his invention since as he has managed them they are a sort of supernumerary pictures of the persons or things to which they were joined we see the motion of hectors plumes in the epithet the landscape of mount neritus in that of and so of others which particular images could not have been insisted upon so long as to express them in a description though but of a single line without diverting the reader too much from the principal action or figure as a metaphor is a short simile one of these epithets is a short description lastly if we consider his versification we shall be sensible what a share of praise is due to his invention in that also he was not satisfied with his language as he found it settled in any one part of greece but searched through its different dialects with this particular view to beautify and perfect his numbers he considered these as they had a greater mixture of vowels or consonants and accordingly employed them as the verse required either a greater smoothness or strength what he most affected was the ionic which has a peculiar sweetness from its never using contractions and from its custom of resolving the diphthongs into two syllables so as to make the words open themselves with a more spreading and sonorous fluency with this he mingled the attic contractions the broader doric and the feebler olic which often rejects its aspirate or takes off its accent and completed this variety by altering some letters with the licence of poetry thus his measures instead of being fetters to his sense were always in readiness to run along with the warmth of his rapture and even to give a further representation of his notions in the correspondence of their sounds to what they signified out of all these he has derived that harmony which makes us confess he had not only the richest head but the finest ear in the world this is so great a truth that whoever will but consult the tune of his verses even without understanding them with the same sort of diligence as we daily see practised in the case of italian operas will find more sweetness variety and majesty of sound than in any other language of poetry the beauty of his numbers is allowed by the critics to be copied but faintly by virgil himself though they are so just as to ascribe it to the nature of the latin tongue indeed the greek has some advantages both from the natural sound of its words and the turn and cadence of its verse which agree with the genius of no other language virgil was very sensible of this and used the utmost diligence in working up a more intractable language to whatsoever graces it was capable of and in particular never failed to bring the sound of his line to a beautiful agreement with its sense if the grecian poet has not been so frequently celebrated on this account as the roman the only reason is that fewer critics have understood one language than the other dionysius of halicarnassus has pointed out many of our authors beauties in this kind in his treatise of the composition of words it suffices at present to observe of his numbers that they flow with so much ease as to make one imagine homer had no other care than to transcribe as fast as the muses dictated and at the same time with so much force and inspiriting vigour that they awaken and raise us like the sound of a trumpet they roll along as a plentiful river always in motion and always full while we are borne away by a tide of verse the most rapid and yet the most smooth imaginable thus on whatever side we contemplate homer what principally strikes us is his invention it is that which forms the character of each part of his work and accordingly we find it to have made his fable more extensive and copious than any other his manners more lively and strongly marked his speeches more affecting and transported his sentiments more warm and sublime his images and descriptions more full and animated his expression more raised and daring and his numbers more rapid and various i hope in what has been said of virgil with regard to any of these heads i have no way derogated from his character nothing is more absurd or endless than the common method of comparing eminent writers by an opposition of particular passages in them and forming a judgment from thence of their merit upon the whole we ought to have a certain knowledge of the principal character and distinguishing excellence of each it is in that we are to consider him and in proportion to his degree in that we are to admire him no author or man ever excelled all the world in more than one faculty and as homer has done this in invention virgil has in judgment not that we are to think that homer wanted judgment because virgil had it in a more eminent degree or that virgil wanted invention because homer possessed a larger share of it each of these great authors had more of both than perhaps any man besides and are only said to have less in comparison with one another homer was the greater genius virgil the better artist in one we most admire the man in the other the work homer hurries and transports us with a commanding impetuosity virgil leads us with an attractive majesty homer scatters with a generous profusion virgil bestows with a careful magnificence homer like the nile pours out his riches with a boundless overflow virgil like a river in its banks with a gentle and constant stream when we behold their battles methinks the two poets resemble the heroes they celebrate homer boundless and resistless as achilles bears all before him and shines more and more as the tumult increases virgil calmly daring like neas appears undisturbed in the midst of the action disposes all about him and conquers with tranquillity and when we look upon their machines homer seems like his own jupiter in his terrors shaking olympus scattering the lightnings and firing the heavens virgil like the same power in his benevolence counselling with the gods laying plans for empires and regularly ordering his whole creation but after all it is with great parts as with great virtues they naturally border on some imperfection and it is often hard to distinguish exactly where the virtue ends or the fault begins as prudence may sometimes sink to suspicion so may a great judgment decline to coldness and as magnanimity may run up to profusion or extravagance so may a great invention to redundancy or wildness if we look upon homer in this view we shall perceive the chief objections against him to proceed from so noble a cause as the excess of this faculty among these we may reckon some of his marvellous fictions upon which so much criticism has been spent as surpassing all the bounds of probability perhaps it may be with great and superior souls as with gigantic bodies which exerting themselves with unusual strength exceed what is commonly thought the due proportion of parts to become miracles in the whole and like the old heroes of that make commit something near extravagance amidst a series of glorious and inimitable performances thus homer has his speaking horses and virgil his myrtles distilling blood where the latter has not so much as contrived the easy intervention of a deity to save the probability it is owing to the same vast invention that his similes have been thought too exuberant and full of circumstances the force of this faculty is seen in nothing more than in its inability to confine itself to that single circumstance upon which the comparison is grounded it runs out into embellishments of additional images which however are so managed as not to overpower the main one his similes are like pictures where the principal figure has not only its proportion given agreeable to the original but is also set off with occasional ornaments and prospects the same will account for his manner of heaping a number of comparisons together in one breath when his fancy suggested to him at once so many various and correspondent images the reader will easily extend this observation to more objections of the same kind if there are others which seem rather to charge him with a defect or narrowness of genius than an excess of it those seeming defects will be found upon examination to proceed wholly from the nature of the times he lived in such are his grosser representations of the gods and the vicious and imperfect manners of his heroes but i must here speak a word of the latter as it is a point generally carried into extremes both by the censurers and defenders of homer it must be a strange partiality to antiquity to think with madame dacier that those times and manners are so much the more excellent as they are more contrary to ours who can be so prejudiced in their favour as to magnify the felicity of those ages when a spirit of revenge and cruelty joined with the practice of rapine and robbery reigned through the world when no mercy was shown but for the sake of lucre when the greatest princes were put to the sword and their wives and daughters made slaves and concubines on the other side i would not be so delicate as those modern critics who are shocked at the servile offices and mean employments in which we sometimes see the heroes of homer engaged there is a pleasure in taking a view of that simplicity in opposition to the luxury of succeeding ages in beholding monarchs without their guards princes tending their flocks and princesses drawing water from the springs when we read homer we ought to reflect that we are reading the most ancient author in the heathen world and those who consider him in this light will double their pleasure in the perusal of him let them think they are growing acquainted with nations and people that are now no more that they are stepping almost three thousand years back into the remotest antiquity and entertaining themselves with a clear and surprising vision of things nowhere else to be found the only true mirror of that ancient world by this means alone their greatest obstacles will vanish and what usually creates their dislike will become a satisfaction this consideration may further serve to answer for the constant use of the same epithets to his gods and heroes such as the fardarting phbus the blueeyed pallas the swiftfooted achilles c which some have censured as impertinent and tediously repeated those of the gods depended upon the powers and offices then believed to belong to them and had contracted a weight and veneration from the rites and solemn devotions in which they were used they were a sort of attributes with which it was a matter of religion to salute them on all occasions and which it was an irreverence to omit as for the epithets of great men mons boileau is of opinion that they were in the nature of surnames and repeated as such for the greeks having no names derived from their fathers were obliged to add some other distinction of each person either naming his parents expressly or his place of birth profession or the like as alexander the son of philip herodotus of halicarnassus diogenes the cynic c homer therefore complying with the custom of his country used such distinctive additions as better agreed with poetry and indeed we have something parallel to these in modern times such as the names of harold harefoot edmund ironside edward longshanks edward the black prince c if yet this be thought to account better for the propriety than for the repetition i shall add a further conjecture hesiod dividing the world into its different ages has placed a fourth age between the brazen and the iron one of heroes distinct from other men a divine race who fought at thebes and troy are called demigods and live by the care of jupiter in the islands of the blessed now among the divine honours which were paid them they might have this also in common with the gods not to be mentioned without the solemnity of an epithet and such as might be acceptable to them by celebrating their families actions or qualities what other cavils have been raised against homer are such as hardly deserve a reply but will yet be taken notice of as they occur in the course of the work many have been occasioned by an injudicious endeavour to exalt virgil which is much the same as if one should think to raise the superstructure by undermining the foundation one would imagine by the whole course of their parallels that these critics never so much as heard of homers having written first a consideration which whoever compares these two poets ought to have always in his eye some accuse him for the same things which they overlook or praise in the other as when they prefer the fable and moral of the neis to those of the iliad for the same reasons which might set the odyssey above the neis as that the hero is a wiser man and the action of the one more beneficial to his country than that of the other or else they blame him for not doing what he never designed as because achilles is not as good and perfect a prince as neas when the very moral of his poem required a contrary character it is thus that rapin judges in his comparison of homer and virgil others select those particular passages of homer which are not so laboured as some that virgil drew out of them this is the whole management of scaliger in his poetics others quarrel with what they take for low and mean expressions sometimes through a false delicacy and refinement oftener from an ignorance of the graces of the original and then triumph in the awkwardness of their own translations this is the conduct of perrault in his parallels lastly there are others who pretending to a fairer proceeding distinguish between the personal merit of homer and that of his work but when they come to assign the causes of the great reputation of the iliad they found it upon the ignorance of his times and the prejudice of those that followed and in pursuance of this principle they make those accidents such as the contention of the cities c to be the causes of his fame which were in reality the consequences of his merit the same might as well be said of virgil or any great author whose general character will infallibly raise many casual additions to their reputation this is the method of mons de la mott who yet confesses upon the whole that in whatever age homer had lived he must have been the greatest poet of his nation and that he may be said in his sense to be the master even of those who surpassed him in all these objections we see nothing that contradicts his title to the honour of the chief invention and as long as this which is indeed the characteristic of poetry itself remains unequalled by his followers he still continues superior to them a cooler judgment may commit fewer faults and be more approved in the eyes of one sort of critics but that warmth of fancy will carry the loudest and most universal applauses which holds the heart of a reader under the strongest enchantment homer not only appears the inventor of poetry but excels all the inventors of other arts in this that he has swallowed up the honour of those who succeeded him what he has done admitted no increase it only left room for contraction or regulation he showed all the stretch of fancy at once and if he has failed in some of his flights it was but because he attempted everything a work of this kind seems like a mighty tree which rises from the most vigorous seed is improved with industry flourishes and produces the finest fruit nature and art conspire to raise it pleasure and profit join to make it valuable and they who find the justest faults have only said that a few branches which run luxuriant through a richness of nature might be lopped into form to give it a more regular appearance having now spoken of the beauties and defects of the original it remains to treat of the translation with the same view to the chief characteristic as far as that is seen in the main parts of the poem such as the fable manners and sentiments no translator can prejudice it but by wilful omissions or contractions as it also breaks out in every particular image description and simile whoever lessens or too much softens those takes off from this chief character it is the first grand duty of an interpreter to give his author entire and unmaimed and for the rest the diction and versification only are his proper province since these must be his own but the others he is to take as he finds them it should then be considered what methods may afford some equivalent in our language for the graces of these in the greek it is certain no literal translation can be just to an excellent original in a superior language but it is a great mistake to imagine as many have done that a rash paraphrase can make amends for this general defect which is no less in danger to lose the spirit of an ancient by deviating into the modern manners of expression if there be sometimes a darkness there is often a light in antiquity which nothing better preserves than a version almost literal i know no liberties one ought to take but those which are necessary to transfusing the spirit of the original and supporting the poetical style of the translation and i will venture to say there have not been more men misled in former times by a servile dull adherence to the letter than have been deluded in ours by a chimerical insolent hope of raising and improving their author it is not to be doubted that the fire of the poem is what a translator should principally regard as it is most likely to expire in his managing however it is his safest way to be content with preserving this to his utmost in the whole without endeavouring to be more than he finds his author is in any particular place it is a great secret in writing to know when to be plain and when poetical and figurative and it is what homer will teach us if we will but follow modestly in his footsteps where his diction is bold and lofty let us raise ours as high as we can but where his is plain and humble we ought not to be deterred from imitating him by the fear of incurring the censure of a mere english critic nothing that belongs to homer seems to have been more commonly mistaken than the just pitch of his style some of his translators having swelled into fustian in a proud confidence of the sublime others sunk into flatness in a cold and timorous notion of simplicity methinks i see these different followers of homer some sweating and straining after him by violent leaps and bounds the certain signs of false mettle others slowly and servilely creeping in his train while the poet himself is all the time proceeding with an unaffected and equal majesty before them however of the two extremes one could sooner pardon frenzy than frigidity no author is to be envied for such commendations as he may gain by that character of style which his friends must agree together to call simplicity and the rest of the world will call dulness there is a graceful and dignified simplicity as well as a bold and sordid one which differ as much from each other as the air of a plain man from that of a sloven it is one thing to be tricked up and another not to be dressed at all simplicity is the mean between ostentation and rusticity this pure and noble simplicity is nowhere in such perfection as in the scripture and our author one may affirm with all respect to the inspired writings that the divine spirit made use of no other words but what were intelligible and common to men at that time and in that part of the world and as homer is the author nearest to those his style must of course bear a greater resemblance to the sacred books than that of any other writer this consideration together with what has been observed of the parity of some of his thoughts may methinks induce a translator on the one hand to give in to several of those general phrases and manners of expression which have attained a veneration even in our language from being used in the old testament as on the other to avoid those which have been appropriated to the divinity and in a manner consigned to mystery and religion for a further preservation of this air of simplicity a particular care should be taken to express with all plainness those moral sentences and proverbial speeches which are so numerous in this poet they have something venerable and as i may say oracular in that unadorned gravity and shortness with which they are delivered a grace which would be utterly lost by endeavouring to give them what we call a more ingenious that is a more modern turn in the paraphrase perhaps the mixture of some grcisms and old words after the manner of milton if done without too much affectation might not have an ill effect in a version of this particular work which most of any other seems to require a venerable antique cast but certainly the use of modern terms of war and government such as platoon campaign junto or the like into which some of his translators have fallen cannot be allowable those only excepted without which it is impossible to treat the subjects in any living language there are two peculiarities in homers diction which are a sort of marks or moles by which every common eye distinguishes him at first sight those who are not his greatest admirers look upon them as defects and those who are seemed pleased with them as beauties i speak of his compound epithets and of his repetitions many of the former cannot be done literally into english without destroying the purity of our language i believe such should be retained as slide easily of themselves into an english compound without violence to the ear or to the received rules of composition as well as those which have received a sanction from the authority of our best poets and are become familiar through their use of them such as the cloudcompelling jove c as for the rest whenever any can be as fully and significantly expressed in a single word as in a compounded one the course to be taken is obvious some that cannot be so turned as to preserve their full image by one or two words may have justice done them by circumlocution as the epithet einosiphyllos to a mountain would appear little or ridiculous translated literally leafshaking but affords a majestic idea in the periphrasis the lofty mountain shakes his waving woods others that admit of different significations may receive an advantage from a judicious variation according to the occasions on which they are introduced for example the epithet of apollo or farshooting is capable of two explications one literal in respect of the darts and bow the ensigns of that god the other allegorical with regard to the rays of the sun therefore in such places where apollo is represented as a god in person i would use the former interpretation and where the effects of the sun are described i would make choice of the latter upon the whole it will be necessary to avoid that perpetual repetition of the same epithets which we find in homer and which though it might be accommodated as has been already shown to the ear of those times is by no means so to ours but one may wait for opportunities of placing them where they derive an additional beauty from the occasions on which they are employed and in doing this properly a translator may at once show his fancy and his judgment as for homers repetitions we may divide them into three sorts of whole narrations and speeches of single sentences and of one verse or hemistitch i hope it is not impossible to have such a regard to these as neither to lose so known a mark of the author on the one hand nor to offend the reader too much on the other the repetition is not ungraceful in those speeches where the dignity of the speaker renders it a sort of insolence to alter his words as in the messages from gods to men or from higher powers to inferiors in concerns of state or where the ceremonial of religion seems to require it in the solemn forms of prayers oaths or the like in other cases i believe the best rule is to be guided by the nearness or distance at which the repetitions are placed in the original when they follow too close one may vary the expression but it is a question whether a professed translator be authorized to omit any if they be tedious the author is to answer for it it only remains to speak of the versification homer as has been said is perpetually applying the sound to the sense and varying it on every new subject this is indeed one of the most exquisite beauties of poetry and attainable by very few i only know of homer eminent for it in the greek and virgil in the latin i am sensible it is what may sometimes happen by chance when a writer is warm and fully possessed of his image however it may reasonably be believed they designed this in whose verse it so manifestly appears in a superior degree to all others few readers have the ear to be judges of it but those who have will see i have endeavoured at this beauty upon the whole i must confess myself utterly incapable of doing justice to homer i attempt him in no other hope but that which one may entertain without much vanity of giving a more tolerable copy of him than any entire translation in verse has yet done we have only those of chapman hobbes and ogilby chapman has taken the advantage of an immeasurable length of verse notwithstanding which there is scarce any paraphrase more loose and rambling than his he has frequent interpolations of four or six lines and i remember one in the thirteenth book of the odyssey ver where he has spun twenty verses out of two he is often mistaken in so bold a manner that one might think he deviated on purpose if he did not in other places of his notes insist so much upon verbal trifles he appears to have had a strong affectation of extracting new meanings out of his author insomuch as to promise in his rhyming preface a poem of the mysteries he had revealed in homer and perhaps he endeavoured to strain the obvious sense to this end his expression is involved in fustian a fault for which he was remarkable in his original writings as in the tragedy of bussy damboise c in a word the nature of the man may account for his whole performance for he appears from his preface and remarks to have been of an arrogant turn and an enthusiast in poetry his own boast of having finished half the iliad in less than fifteen weeks shows with what negligence his version was performed but that which is to be allowed him and which very much contributed to cover his defects is a daring fiery spirit that animates his translation which is something like what one might imagine homer himself would have writ before he arrived at years of discretion hobbes has given us a correct explanation of the sense in general but for particulars and circumstances he continually lops them and often omits the most beautiful as for its being esteemed a close translation i doubt not many have been led into that error by the shortness of it which proceeds not from his following the original line by line but from the contractions above mentioned he sometimes omits whole similes and sentences and is now and then guilty of mistakes into which no writer of his learning could have fallen but through carelessness his poetry as well as ogilbys is too mean for criticism it is a great loss to the poetical world that mr dryden did not live to translate the iliad he has left us only the first book and a small part of the sixth in which if he has in some places not truly interpreted the sense or preserved the antiquities it ought to be excused on account of the haste he was obliged to write in he seems to have had too much regard to chapman whose words he sometimes copies and has unhappily followed him in passages where he wanders from the original however had he translated the whole work i would no more have attempted homer after him than virgil his version of whom notwithstanding some human errors is the most noble and spirited translation i know in any language but the fate of great geniuses is like that of great ministers though they are confessedly the first in the commonwealth of letters they must be envied and calumniated only for being at the head of it that which in my opinion ought to be the endeavour of any one who translates homer is above all things to keep alive that spirit and fire which makes his chief character in particular places where the sense can bear any doubt to follow the strongest and most poetical as most agreeing with that character to copy him in all the variations of his style and the different modulations of his numbers to preserve in the more active or descriptive parts a warmth and elevation in the more sedate or narrative a plainness and solemnity in the speeches a fulness and perspicuity in the sentences a shortness and gravity not to neglect even the little figures and turns on the words nor sometimes the very cast of the periods neither to omit nor confound any rites or customs of antiquity perhaps too he ought to include the whole in a shorter compass than has hitherto been done by any translator who has tolerably preserved either the sense or poetry what i would further recommend to him is to study his author rather from his own text than from any commentaries how learned soever or whatever figure they may make in the estimation of the world to consider him attentively in comparison with virgil above all the ancients and with milton above all the moderns next these the archbishop of cambrays telemachus may give him the truest idea of the spirit and turn of our author and bossus admirable treatise of the epic poem the justest notion of his design and conduct but after all with whatever judgment and study a man may proceed or with whatever happiness he may perform such a work he must hope to please but a few those only who have at once a taste of poetry and competent learning for to satisfy such a want either is not in the nature of this undertaking since a mere modern wit can like nothing that is not modern and a pedant nothing that is not greek what i have done is submitted to the public from whose opinions i am prepared to learn though i fear no judges so little as our best poets who are most sensible of the weight of this task as for the worst whatever they shall please to say they may give me some concern as they are unhappy men but none as they are malignant writers i was guided in this translation by judgments very different from theirs and by persons for whom they can have no kindness if an old observation be true that the strongest antipathy in the world is that of fools to men of wit mr addison was the first whose advice determined me to undertake this task who was pleased to write to me upon that occasion in such terms as i cannot repeat without vanity i was obliged to sir richard steele for a very early recommendation of my undertaking to the public dr swift promoted my interest with that warmth with which he always serves his friend the humanity and frankness of sir samuel garth are what i never knew wanting on any occasion i must also acknowledge with infinite pleasure the many friendly offices as well as sincere criticisms of mr congreve who had led me the way in translating some parts of homer i must add the names of mr rowe and dr parnell though i shall take a further opportunity of doing justice to the last whose good nature to give it a great panegyric is no less extensive than his learning the favour of these gentlemen is not entirely undeserved by one who bears them so true an affection but what can i say of the honour so many of the great have done me while the first names of the age appear as my subscribers and the most distinguished patrons and ornaments of learning as my chief encouragers among these it is a particular pleasure to me to find that my highest obligations are to such who have done most honour to the name of poet that his grace the duke of buckingham was not displeased i should undertake the author to whom he has given in his excellent essay so complete a praise read homer once and you can read no more for all books else appear so mean so poor verse will seem prose but still persist to read and homer will be all the books you need that the earl of halifax was one of the first to favour me of whom it is hard to say whether the advancement of the polite arts is more owing to his generosity or his example that such a genius as my lord bolingbroke not more distinguished in the great scenes of business than in all the useful and entertaining parts of learning has not refused to be the critic of these sheets and the patron of their writer and that the noble author of the tragedy of heroic love has continued his partiality to me from my writing pastorals to my attempting the iliad i cannot deny myself the pride of confessing that i have had the advantage not only of their advice for the conduct in general but their correction of several particulars of this translation i could say a great deal of the pleasure of being distinguished by the earl of carnarvon but it is almost absurd to particularize any one generous action in a person whose whole life is a continued series of them mr stanhope the present secretary of state will pardon my desire of having it known that he was pleased to promote this affair the particular zeal of mr harcourt the son of the late lord chancellor gave me a proof how much i am honoured in a share of his friendship i must attribute to the same motive that of several others of my friends to whom all acknowledgments are rendered unnecessary by the privileges of a familiar correspondence and i am satisfied i can no way better oblige men of their turn than by my silence in short i have found more patrons than ever homer wanted he would have thought himself happy to have met the same favour at athens that has been shown me by its learned rival the university of oxford and i can hardly envy him those pompous honours he received after death when i reflect on the enjoyment of so many agreeable obligations and easy friendships which make the satisfaction of life this distinction is the more to be acknowledged as it is shown to one whose pen has never gratified the prejudices of particular parties or the vanities of particular men whatever the success may prove i shall never repent of an undertaking in which i have experienced the candour and friendship of so many persons of merit and in which i hope to pass some of those years of youth that are generally lost in a circle of follies after a manner neither wholly unuseful to others nor disagreeable to myself the iliad book i argument the contention of achilles and agamemnon in the war of troy

declare the priest to reverence and release the fair not so atrides he with wonted pride the sire insulted and his gifts denied the insulted sire his gods peculiar care to phbus prayd and phbus heard the prayer a dreadful plague ensues the avenging darts incessant fly and pierce the grecian hearts a prophet then inspired by heaven arose and points the crime and thence derives the woes myself the first the assembled chiefs incline to avert the vengeance of the power divine then rising in his wrath the monarch stormd incensed he threatend and his threats performd the fair chryses to her sire

the twelfth revolving light then will i mount the brazen dome and move the high tribunal of immortal jove the goddess spoke the rolling waves unclose then down the steep she plunged from whence she rose and left him sorrowing on the lonely coast in wild resentment for the fair he lost in chrysas port now sage ulysses rode beneath the deck the destined victims stowd the sails they furld they lash the mast aside and droppd their anchors and the pinnace tied next on the shore their hecatomb they land chryses last descending on the strand her thus returning from the furrowd main ulysses led to phbus sacred fane where at his solemn altar as the maid he gave to chryses thus the hero said hail reverend priest to phbus awful dome a suppliant i from great atrides come unransomd here receive the spotless fair accept the hecatomb the greeks prepare and may thy god who scatters darts around atoned by sacrifice desist to wound at this the sire embraced the maid again so sadly lost so lately sought in vain then near the altar of the darting king disposed in rank their hecatomb they bring with water purify their hands and take the sacred offering of the salted cake while thus with arms devoutly raised in air and solemn voice the priest directs his prayer god of the silver bow thy ear incline whose power incircles cilla the divine whose sacred eye thy tenedos surveys and gilds fair chrysa with distinguishd rays if fired to vengeance at thy priests request thy direful darts inflict the raging pest once more attend avert the wasteful woe and smile propitious and unbend thy bow so chryses prayd apollo heard his prayer and now the greeks their hecatomb prepare between their horns the salted barley threw and with their heads to heaven the victims slew the limbs they sever from the inclosing hide the thighs selected to the gods divide on these in double cauls involved with art the choicest morsels lay from every part the priest himself before his altar stands and burns the offering with his holy hands pours the black wine and sees the flames aspire the youth with instruments surround the fire the thighs thus sacrificed and entrails dressd the assistants part transfix and roast the rest then spread the tables the repast prepare each takes his seat and each receives his share when now the rage of hunger was repressd with pure libations they conclude the feast the youths with wine the copious goblets crownd and pleased dispense the flowing bowls around with hymns divine the joyous banquet ends the pans lengthend till the sun descends the greeks restored the grateful notes prolong apollo listens and approves the song twas night the chiefs beside their vessel lie till rosy morn had purpled oer the sky then launch and hoist the mast indulgent gales supplied by phbus fill the swelling sails the milkwhite canvas bellying as they blow the parted ocean foams and roars below above the bounding billows swift they flew till now the grecian camp appeard in view far on the beach they haul their bark to land the crooked keel divides the yellow sand then part where stretchd along the winding bay the ships and tents in mingled prospect lay but raging still amidst his navy sat the stern achilles stedfast in his hate nor mixd in combat nor in council joind but wasting cares lay heavy on his mind in his black thoughts revenge and slaughter roll and scenes of blood rise dreadful in his soul twelve days were past and now the dawning light the gods had summond to the olympian height jove first ascending from the watery bowers leads the long order of ethereal powers when like the morningmist in early day rose from the flood the daughter of the sea and to the seats divine her flight addressd there far apart and high above the rest the thunderer sat where old olympus shrouds his hundred heads in heaven and props the clouds suppliant the goddess stood one hand she placed beneath his beard and one his knees embraced if eer o father of the gods she said my words could please thee or my actions aid some marks of honour on my son bestow and pay in glory what in life you owe fame is at least by heavenly promise due to life so short and now dishonourd too avenge this wrong o ever just and wise let greece be humbled and the trojans rise till the proud king and all the achaian race shall heap with honours him they now disgrace illustration thetis entreating jupiter to honour achilles thus thetis spoke but jove in silence held the sacred counsels of his breast conceald not so repulsed the goddess closer pressd still graspd his knees and urged the dear request o sire of gods and men thy suppliant hear refuse or grant for what has jove to fear or oh declare of all the powers above is wretched thetis least the care of jove she said and sighing thus the god replies who rolls the thunder oer the vaulted skies what hast thou askd ah why should jove engage in foreign contests and domestic rage the gods complaints and junos fierce alarms while i too partial aid the trojan arms go lest the haughty partner of my sway with jealous eyes thy close access survey but part in peace secure thy prayer is sped witness the sacred honours of our

consort hides to this the thunderer seek not thou to find the sacred counsels of almighty mind involved in darkness lies the great decree nor can the depths of fate be pierced by thee what fits thy knowledge thou the first shalt know the first of gods above and men below but thou nor they shall search the thoughts that roll deep in the close recesses of my soul full on the sire the goddess of

what fatal favour has the goddess won to grace her fierce inexorable son perhaps in grecian blood to drench the plain and glut his vengeance with my people slain then thus the god o restless fate of pride that strives to learn what heaven resolves to hide vain is the search presumptuous and abhorrd anxious to thee and odious to thy lord let this suffice the immutable decree no force can shake what is that ought to be goddess submit nor dare our will withstand but dread the power of this avenging hand the united strength of all the gods above in vain resists the omnipotence of jove illustration vulcan the thunderer spoke nor durst the queen reply a reverent horror silenced all the sky the feast disturbd with sorrow vulcan saw his mother menaced and the gods in awe peace at his

eternal peace and constant joy thou goddessmother with our sire comply nor break the sacred union of the sky lest roused to rage he shake the blessd abodes launch the red lightning and dethrone the

army to battle in order to make the greeks sensible of their want of achilles the general who is deluded with the hopes of taking troy without his assistance but fears the army was discouraged by his absence and the late plague as well as by the length of time contrives to make trial of their disposition by a stratagem he first communicates his design to the princes in council that he would propose a return to the soldiers and that they should put a stop to them if the proposal was embraced then he assembles the whole host and upon moving for a return to greece they unanimously agree to it and run to prepare the ships they are detained by the management of ulysses who chastises the insolence of thersites the assembly is recalled several speeches made on the occasion and at length the advice of nestor followed which was to make a general muster of the troops and to divide them into their several nations before they proceeded to battle this gives occasion to the poet to enumerate all the forces of the greeks and trojans and in a large catalogue the time employed in this book consists not entirely of one day the scene lies in the grecian camp and upon the seashore towards the end it removes to troy now pleasing sleep had seald each mortal eye stretchd in the tents the grecian leaders lie the immortals slumberd on their thrones above all but the everwakeful eyes of jove to

for our return we trust the heavenly powers be that their care to fight like men be ours but grant the host with wealth the general load except detraction what hast thou bestowd suppose some hero should his spoils resign art thou that hero could those spoils be thine gods let me perish on this hateful shore and let these eyes behold my son no more if on thy next offence this hand forbear to

tears while to his neighbour each expressd his thought ye gods what wonders has ulysses wrought what fruits his conduct and his courage yield great in the council glorious in the field generous he rises in the crowns defence to curb the factious tongue of insolence such just examples on offenders shown sedition silence and assert the throne twas thus the general voice the hero praised who rising high the imperial sceptre raised the blueeyed pallas his celestial friend in form a herald bade the crowds attend the expecting crowds in still attention hung to hear the wisdom of his heavenly tongue then deeply thoughtful pausing ere he spoke his silence thus the prudent hero broke unhappy monarch whom the grecian race with shame deserting heap with vile disgrace not such at argos was their generous vow once all their voice but ah forgotten now neer to return was then the common cry till troys proud structures should in ashes lie behold them weeping for their native shore what could their wives or helpless children more what heart but melts to leave the tender train and one short month endure the wintry main few leagues removed we wish our peaceful seat when the ship tosses and the tempests beat then well may this long stay provoke their tears the tedious length of nine revolving years not for their grief the grecian host i blame but vanquishd baffled oh eternal shame expect the time to troys destruction given and try the faith of chalcas and of heaven what passd at aulis greece can witness bear and all who live to breathe this phrygian air beside a fountains sacred brink we raised our verdant altars and the victims blazed twas where the planetree spread its shades around the altars heaved and from the crumbling ground a mighty dragon shot of dire portent from jove himself the dreadful sign was sent straight to the tree his sanguine spires he rolld and curld around in many a winding fold the topmost branch a motherbird possessd eight callow infants filld the mossy nest herself the ninth the serpent as he hung stretchd his black jaws and crushd the crying young while hovering near with miserable moan the drooping mother waild her children gone the mother last as round the nest she flew seized by the beating wing the monster slew nor long survived to marble turnd he stands a lasting prodigy on aulis sands such was the will of jove and hence we dare trust in his omen and support the war for while around we gazed with wondering eyes and trembling sought the powers with sacrifice full of his god the reverend chalcas cried ye grecian warriors lay your fears aside this wondrous signal jove himself displays of long long labours but eternal praise as many birds as by the snake were slain so many years the toils of greece remain but wait the tenth for ilions fall decreed thus spoke the prophet thus the fates succeed obey ye grecians with submission wait nor let your flight avert the trojan fate he said the shores with loud applauses sound the hollow ships each deafening shout rebound then nestor thusthese vain debates forbear ye talk like children not like heroes dare where now are all your high resolves at last your leagues concluded your engagements past vowd with libations and with victims then now vanishd like their smoke the faith of men while useless words consume the unactive hours no wonder troy so long resists our powers rise great atrides and with courage sway we march to war if thou direct the way but leave the few that dare resist thy laws the mean deserters of the grecian cause to grudge the conquests mighty jove prepares and view with envy our successful wars on that great day when first the martial train big with the fate of ilion ploughd the main jove on the right a prosperous signal sent and thunder rolling shook the firmament encouraged hence maintain the glorious strife till every soldier grasp a phrygian wife till helens woes at full revenged appear and troys proud matrons render tear for tear before that day if any greek invite his countrys troops to base inglorious flight stand forth that greek and hoist his sail to fly and die the dastard first who dreads to die but now o monarch all thy chiefs advise nor what they offer thou thyself despise among those counsels let not mine be vain in tribes and nations to divide thy train his separate troops let every leader call each strengthen each and all encourage all what chief or soldier of the numerous band or bravely fights or ill obeys command when thus distinct they war shall soon be known and what the cause of ilion not oerthrown if fate resists or if our arms are slow if gods above prevent or men below to him the king how much thy years excel in arts of counsel and in speaking well o would the gods in love to greece decree but ten such sages as they grant in thee such wisdom soon should priams force destroy and soon should fall the haughty towers of troy but jove forbids who plunges those he hates in fierce contention and in vain debates now great achilles from our aid withdraws by me provoked a captive maid the cause if eer as friends we join the trojan wall must shake and heavy will the vengeance fall but now ye warriors take a short repast and well refreshd to bloody conflict haste his sharpend spear let every grecian wield and every grecian fix his brazen shield let all excite the fiery steeds of war and all for combat fit the rattling car this day this dreadful day let each contend no rest no respite till the shades descend till darkness or till death shall cover all let the war bleed and let the mighty fall till bathed in sweat be every manly breast with the huge shield each brawny arm depressd each aching nerve refuse the lance to throw and each spent courser at the chariot blow who dares inglorious in his ships to stay who dares to tremble on this signal day that wretch too mean to fall by martial power the birds shall mangle and the dogs devour the monarch spoke and straight a murmur rose loud as the surges when the tempest blows that dashd on broken rocks tumultuous roar and foam and thunder on the stony shore straight to the tents the troops dispersing bend the fires are kindled and the smokes ascend with hasty feasts they sacrifice and pray to avert the dangers of the doubtful day a steer of five years age large limbd and fed to joves

gallant grace and dared the bravest of the grecian race as thus with glorious air and proud disdain he boldly stalkd the foremost on the plain him menelaus loved of mars espies with heart elated and with joyful eyes so joys a lion if the branching deer or mountain goat his bulky prize appear eager he seizes and devours the slain pressd by bold youths and baying dogs in vain thus fond of vengeance with a furious bound in clanging arms he leaps upon the ground from his high chariot him approaching near the beauteous champion views with marks of fear smit with a conscious sense retires behind and shuns the fate he well deserved to find as when some shepherd from the rustling trees shot forth to view a scaly serpent sees trembling and pale he starts with wild affright and all confused precipitates his flight so from the king the shining warrior flies and plunged amid the thickest trojans lies as godlike hector sees the prince retreat he thus upbraids him with a generous heat unhappy paris but to women brave so fairly formd and only to deceive oh hadst thou died when first thou sawst the light or died at least before thy nuptial rite a better fate than vainly thus to boast and fly the scandal of thy trojan host gods how the scornful greeks exult to see their fears of danger undeceived in thee thy figure promised with a martial air but ill thy soul supplies a form so fair in former days in all thy gallant pride when thy tall ships triumphant stemmd the tide when greece beheld thy painted canvas flow and crowds stood wondering at the passing show say was it thus with such a baffled mien you met the approaches of the spartan queen thus from her realm conveyd the beauteous prize and both her warlike lords outshined in helens eyes this deed thy foes delight thy own disgrace thy fathers grief and ruin of thy race this deed recalls thee to the profferd fight or hast thou injured whom thou darst not right soon to thy cost the field would make thee know thou keepst the consort of a braver foe thy graceful form instilling soft desire thy curling tresses and thy silver lyre beauty and youth in vain to these you trust when youth and beauty shall be laid in dust troy yet may wake and one avenging blow crush the dire author of his countrys woe his silence here with blushes paris breaks tis just my brother what your anger speaks but who like thee can boast a soul sedate so firmly proof to all the shocks of fate thy force like steel a temperd hardness shows still edged to wound and still untired with blows like steel uplifted by some strenuous swain with falling woods to strew the wasted plain thy gifts i praise nor thou despise the charms with which a lover golden venus arms soft moving speech and pleasing outward show no wish can gain them but the gods bestow yet wouldst thou have the profferd combat stand the greeks and trojans seat on either hand then let a midway space our hosts divide and on that stage of war the cause be tried by paris there the spartan king be fought for beauteous helen and the wealth she brought and who his rival can in arms subdue his be the fair and his the treasure too thus with a lasting league your toils may cease and troy possess her fertile fields in peace thus may the greeks review their native shore much famed for generous steeds for beauty more he said the challenge hector heard with joy then with his spear restraind the youth of troy held by the midst athwart and near the foe advanced with steps majestically slow while round his dauntless head the grecians pour their stones and arrows in a mingled shower then thus the monarch great atrides cried forbear ye warriors lay the darts aside a parley hector asks a message bears we know him by the various plume he wears awed by his high command the greeks attend the tumult silence and the fight suspend while from the centre hector rolls his eyes on either host and thus to both applies hear all ye trojan all ye grecian bands what paris author of the war demands your shining swords within the sheath restrain and pitch your lances in the yielding plain here in the midst in either armys sight he dares the spartan king to single fight and wills that helen and the ravishd spoil that caused the contest shall reward the toil let these the brave triumphant victor grace and different nations part in leagues of peace he spoke in still suspense on either side each army stood the spartan chief replied me too ye warriors hear whose fatal right a world engages in the toils of fight to me the labour of the field resign me paris injured all the war be mine fall he that must beneath his rivals arms and live the rest secure of future harms two lambs devoted by your countrys rite to earth a sable to the sun a white prepare ye trojans while a third we bring select to jove the inviolable king let reverend priam in the truce engage and add the sanction of considerate age his sons are faithless headlong in debate and youth itself an empty wavering state cool age advances venerably wise turns on all hands its deepdiscerning eyes sees what befell and what may yet befall concludes from both and best provides for all the nations hear with rising hopes possessd and peaceful prospects dawn in every breast within the lines they drew their steeds around and from their chariots issued on the ground next all unbuckling the rich mail they wore laid their bright arms along the sable shore on either side the meeting hosts are seen with lances fixd and close the space between two heralds now despatchd to troy invite the phrygian monarch to the peaceful rite talthybius hastens to the fleet to bring the lamb for jove the inviolable king meantime to beauteous helen from the skies the various goddess of the rainbow flies like fair laodice in form and face the loveliest nymph of priams royal race her in the palace at her loom she found the golden web her own sad story crownd the trojan wars she weaved herself the prize and the dire triumphs of her fatal eyes to whom the goddess of the painted bow approach and view the wondrous scene below each hardy greek and valiant trojan knight so dreadful late and furious for the fight now rest their spears or lean upon their shields ceased is the war and silent all the fields paris alone and spartas king advance in single fight to toss the beamy lance each met in arms the fate of combat tries thy love the motive and thy charms the prize this said the manycoloured maid inspires her husbands love and wakes her former fires her country parents all that once were dear rush to her thought and force a tender tear oer her fair face a snowy veil she threw and softly sighing from the loom withdrew her handmaids clymene and thra wait her silent footsteps to the scan gate there sat the seniors of the trojan race old priams chiefs and most in priams grace the king the first thymtes at his side lampus and clytius long in council tried panthus and hicetaon once the strong and next the wisest of the reverend throng antenor grave and sage ucalegon leand on the walls and baskd before the sun chiefs who no more in bloody fights engage but wise through time and narrative with age in summer days like grasshoppers rejoice a bloodless race that send a feeble voice these when the spartan queen approachd the tower in secret ownd resistless beautys power they cried no wonder such celestial charms for nine long years have set the world in arms what winning graces what majestic mien she moves a goddess and she looks a queen yet hence o heaven convey that fatal face and from destruction save the trojan race the good old priam welcomed her and cried approach my child and grace thy fathers side see on the plain thy grecian spouse appears the friends and kindred of thy former years no crime of thine our present sufferings draws not thou but heavens disposing will the cause the gods these armies and this force employ the hostile gods conspire the fate of troy but lift thy eyes and say what greek is he far as from hence these aged orbs can see around whose brow such martial graces shine so tall so awful and almost divine though some of larger stature tread the green none match his grandeur and exalted mien he seems a monarch and his countrys pride thus ceased the king and thus the fair replied before thy presence father i appear with conscious shame and reverential fear ah had i died ere to these walls i fled false to my country and my nuptial bed my brothers friends and daughter left behind false to them all to paris only kind for this i mourn till grief or dire disease shall waste the form whose fault it was to please the king of kings atrides you survey great in the war and great in arts of sway my brother once before my days of shame and oh that still he bore a brothers name with wonder priam viewd the godlike man extolld the happy prince and thus began o blessd atrides born to prosperous fate successful monarch of a mighty state how vast thy empire of your matchless train what numbers lost what numbers yet remain in phrygia once were gallant armies known in ancient time when otreus filld the throne when godlike mygdon led their troops of horse and i to join them raised the trojan force against the manlike amazons we stood and sangars stream ran purple with their blood but far inferior those in martial grace and strength of numbers to this grecian race this said once more he viewd the warrior train whats he whose arms lie scatterd on the plain broad is his breast his shoulders larger spread though great atrides overtops his head nor yet appear his care and conduct small from rank to rank he moves and orders all the stately ram thus measures oer the ground and master of the flock surveys them round then helen thus whom your discerning eyes have singled out is ithacus the wise a barren island boasts his glorious birth his fame for wisdom fills the spacious earth antenor took the word and thus began myself o king have seen that wondrous man when trusting jove and hospitable laws to troy he came to plead the grecian cause great menelaus urged the same request my house was honourd with each royal guest i knew their persons and admired their parts both brave in arms and both approved in arts erect the spartan most engaged our view ulysses seated greater reverence drew when atreus son harangued the listening train just was his sense and his expression plain his words succinct yet full without a fault he spoke no more than just the thing he ought but when ulysses rose in thought profound his modest eyes he fixd upon the ground as one unskilld or dumb he seemd to stand nor raised his head nor stretchd his sceptred hand but when he speaks what elocution flows soft as the fleeces of descending snows the copious accents fall with easy art melting they fall and sink into the heart wondering we hear and fixd in deep surprise our ears refute the censure of our eyes the king then askd as yet the camp he viewd what chief is that with giant strength endued whose brawny shoulders and whose swelling chest and lofty stature far exceed the rest ajax the great the beauteous queen replied himself a host the grecian strength and pride see bold idomeneus superior towers amid yon circle of his cretan powers great as a god i saw him once before with menelaus on the spartan shore the rest i know and could in order name all valiant chiefs and men of mighty fame yet two are wanting of the numerous train whom long my eyes have sought but sought in vain castor and pollux first in martial force one bold on foot and one renownd for horse my brothers these the same our native shore one house containd us as one mother bore perhaps the chiefs from warlike toils at ease for distant troy refused to sail the seas perhaps their swords some nobler quarrel draws ashamed to combat in their sisters cause so spoke the fair nor knew her brothers doom wrapt in the cold embraces of the tomb adornd with honours in their native shore silent they slept and heard of wars no more meantime the heralds through the crowded town bring the rich wine and destined victims down idus arms the golden goblets pressd who thus the venerable king addressd arise o father of the trojan state the nations call thy joyful people wait to seal the truce and end the dire debate paris thy son and spartas king advance in measured lists to toss the weighty lance and who his rival shall in arms subdue his be the dame and his the treasure too thus with a lasting league our toils may cease and troy possess her fertile fields in peace so shall the greeks review their native shore much famed for generous steeds for beauty more with grief he heard and bade the chiefs prepare to join his milkwhite coursers to the car he mounts the seat antenor at his side the gentle steeds through scas gates they guide next from the car descending on the plain amid the grecian host and trojan train slow they proceed the sage ulysses then arose and with him rose the king of men on either side a sacred herald stands the wine they mix and on each monarchs hands pour the full urn then draws the grecian lord his cutlass sheathed beside his ponderous sword from the signd victims crops the curling hair the heralds part it and the princes share then loudly thus before the attentive bands he calls the gods and spreads his lifted hands o first and greatest power whom all obey who high on idas holy mountain sway eternal jove and you bright orb that roll from east to west and view from pole to pole thou mother earth and all ye living floods infernal furies and tartarean gods who rule the dead and horrid woes prepare for perjured kings and all who falsely swear hear and be witness if by paris slain great menelaus press the fatal plain the dame and treasures let the trojan keep and greece returning plough the watery deep if by my brothers lance the trojan bleed be his the wealth and beauteous dame decreed the appointed fine let ilion justly pay and every age record the signal day this if the phrygians shall refuse to yield arms must revenge and mars decide the field with that the chief the tender victims slew and in the dust their bleeding bodies threw the vital spirit issued at the wound and left the members quivering on the ground from the same urn they drink the mingled wine and add libations to the powers divine while thus their prayers united mount the sky hear mighty jove and hear ye gods on high and may their blood who first the league confound shed like this wine disdain the thirsty ground may all their consorts serve promiscuous lust and all their lust be scatterd as the dust thus either host their imprecations joind which jove refused and mingled with the wind the rites now finishd reverend priam rose and thus expressd a heart oercharged with woes ye greeks and trojans let the chiefs engage but spare the weakness of my feeble age in yonder walls that object let me shun nor view the danger of so dear a son whose arms shall conquer and what prince shall fall heaven only knows for heaven disposes all this said the hoary king no longer stayd but on his car the slaughterd victims laid then seized the reins his gentle steeds to guide and drove to troy antenor at his side bold hector and ulysses now dispose the lists of combat and the ground inclose next to decide by sacred lots prepare who first shall launch his pointed spear in air the people pray with elevated hands and words like these are heard through all the bands immortal jove high heavens superior lord on lofty idas holy mount adored whoeer involved us in this dire debate o give that author of the war to fate and shades eternal let division cease and joyful nations join in leagues of peace with eyes averted hector hastes to turn the lots of fight and shakes the brazen urn then paris thine leapd forth by fatal chance ordaind the first to whirl the weighty lance both armies sat the combat to survey beside each chief his azure armour lay and round the lists the generous coursers neigh the beauteous warrior now arrays for fight in gilded arms magnificently bright the purple cuishes clasp his thighs around with flowers adornd with silver buckles bound lycaons corslet his fair body dressd braced in and fitted to his softer breast a radiant baldric oer his shoulder tied sustaind the sword that glitterd at his side his youthful face a polishd helm oerspread the waving horsehair nodded on his head his figured shield a shining orb he takes and in his hand a pointed javelin shakes with equal speed and fired by equal charms the spartan hero sheathes his limbs in arms now round the lists the admiring armies stand with javelins fixd the greek and trojan band amidst the dreadful vale the chiefs advance all pale with rage and shake the threatening lance the trojan first his shining javelin threw full on atrides ringing shield it flew nor pierced the brazen orb but with a bound leapd from the buckler blunted on the ground atrides then his massy lance prepares in act to throw but first prefers his prayers give me great jove to punish lawless lust and lay the trojan gasping in the dust destroy the aggressor aid my righteous cause avenge the breach of hospitable laws let this example future times reclaim and guard from wrong fair friendships holy name he said and poised in air the javelin sent through paris shield the forceful weapon went his corslet pierces and his garment rends and glancing downward near his flank descends the wary trojan bending from the blow eludes the death and disappoints his foe but fierce atrides waved his sword and strook full on his casque the crested helmet shook the brittle steel unfaithful to his hand broke short the fragments glitterd on the sand the raging warrior to the spacious skies raised his upbraiding voice and angry eyes then is it vain in jove himself to trust and is it thus the gods assist the just when crimes provoke us heaven success denies the dart falls harmless and the falchion flies furious he said and towards the grecian crew seized by the crest the unhappy warrior drew struggling he followed while the embroiderd thong that tied his helmet draggd the chief along then had his ruin crownd atrides joy but venus trembled for the prince of troy unseen she came and burst the golden band and left an empty helmet in his hand the casque enraged amidst the greeks he threw the greeks with smiles the polishd trophy view then as once more he lifts the deadly dart in thirst of vengeance at his rivals heart the queen of love her favourd champion shrouds for gods can all things in a veil of clouds raised from the field the panting youth she led and gently laid him on the bridal bed with pleasing sweets his fainting sense renews and all the dome perfumes with heavenly dews meantime the brightest of the female kind the matchless helen oer the walls reclined to her beset with trojan beauties came in borrowd form the laughterloving dame she seemd an ancient maid wellskilld to cull the snowy fleece and wind the twisted wool the goddess softly shook her silken vest that shed perfumes and whispering thus addressd illustration venus disguised inviting helen to the chamber of paris haste happy nymph for thee thy paris calls safe from the fight in yonder lofty walls fair as a god with odours round him spread he lies and waits thee on the wellknown bed not like a warrior parted from the foe but some gay dancer in the public show she spoke and helens secret soul was moved she scornd the champion but the man she loved fair venus neck her eyes that sparkled fire and breast reveald the queen of soft desire struck with her presence straight the lively red forsook her cheek and trembling thus she said then is it still thy pleasure to deceive and womans frailty always to believe say to new nations must i cross the main or carry wars to some soft asian plain for whom must helen break her second vow what other paris is thy darling now left to atrides victor in the strife an odious conquest and a captive wife hence let me sail and if thy paris bear my absence ill let venus ease his care a handmaid goddess at his side to wait renounce the glories of thy heavenly state be fixd for ever to the trojan shore his spouse or slave and mount the skies no more for me to lawless love no longer led i scorn the coward and detest his bed else should i merit everlasting shame and keen reproach from every phrygian dame ill suits it now the joys of love to know too deep my anguish and too wild my woe illustration venus presenting helen to paris then thus incensed the paphian queen replies obey the power from whom thy glories rise should venus leave thee every charm must fly fade from thy cheek and languish in thy eye cease to provoke me lest i make thee more the worlds aversion than their love before now the bright prize for which mankind engage than the sad victim of the public rage at this the fairest of her sex obeyd and veild her blushes in a silken shade unseen and silent from the train she moves led by the goddess of the smiles and loves arrived and enterd at the palace gate the maids officious round their mistress wait then all dispersing various tasks attend the queen and goddess to the prince ascend full in her paris sight the queen of love had placed the beauteous progeny of jove where as he viewd her charms she turnd away her glowing eyes and thus began to say is this the chief who lost to sense of shame late fled the field and yet survives his fame o hadst thou died beneath the righteous sword of that brave man whom once i calld my lord the boaster paris oft desired the day with spartas king to meet in single fray go now once more thy rivals rage excite provoke atrides and renew the fight yet helen bids thee stay lest thou unskilld shouldst fall an easy conquest on the field the prince replies ah cease divinely fair nor add reproaches to the wounds i bear this day the foe prevaild by pallas power we yet may vanquish in a happier hour there want not gods to favour us above but let the business of our life be love these softer moments let delights employ and kind embraces snatch the hasty joy not thus i loved thee when from spartas shore my forced my willing heavenly prize i bore when first entranced in cranaes isle i lay mixd with thy soul and all dissolved away thus having spoke the enamourd phrygian boy rushd to the bed impatient for the joy him helen followd slow with bashful charms and claspd the blooming hero in her arms while these to loves delicious rapture yield the stern atrides rages round the field so some fell lion whom the woods obey roars through the desert and demands his prey paris he seeks impatient to destroy but seeks in vain along the troops of troy even those had yielded to a foe so brave the recreant warrior hateful as the grave then speaking thus the king of kings arose ye trojans dardans all our generous foes hear and attest from heaven with conquest crownd our brothers arms the just success have found be therefore now the spartan wealth restord let argive helen own her lawful lord the appointed fine let ilion justly pay and age to age record this signal day he ceased his armys loud applauses rise and the long shout runs echoing through the skies illustration venus illustration map titled grci antiqu book iv argument the breach of the truce and the first battle the gods deliberate in council concerning the trojan war they agree upon the continuation of it and jupiter sends down minerva to break the truce she persuades pandarus to aim an arrow at menelaus who is wounded but cured by machaon in the meantime some of the trojan troops attack the greeks agamemnon is distinguished in all the parts of a good general he reviews the troops and exhorts the leaders some by praises and others by reproof nestor is particularly celebrated for his military discipline the battle joins and great numbers are slain on both sides the same day continues through this as through the last book as it does also through the two following and almost to the end of the seventh book the scene is wholly in the field before troy and now olympus shining gates unfold the gods with jove assume their thrones of gold immortal hebe fresh with bloom divine the golden goblet crowns with purple wine while the full bowls flow round the powers employ their careful eyes on longcontended troy when jove disposed to tempt saturnias spleen thus waked the fury of his partial queen two powers divine the son of atreus aid imperial juno and the martial maid but high in heaven they sit and gaze from far the tame spectators of his deeds of war not thus fair venus helps her favourd knight the queen of pleasures shares the toils of fight each danger wards and constant in her care saves in the moment of the last despair her act has rescued paris forfeit life though great atrides gaind the glorious strife then say ye powers what signal issue waits to crown this deed and finish all the fates shall heaven by peace the bleeding kingdoms spare or rouse the furies and awake the war yet would the gods for human good provide atrides soon might gain his beauteous bride still priams walls in peaceful honours grow and through his gates the crowding nations flow thus while he spoke the queen of heaven enraged and queen of war in close consult engaged apart they sit their deep designs employ and meditate the future woes of troy though secret anger swelld minervas breast the prudent goddess yet her wrath suppressd but juno impotent of passion broke her sullen silence and with fury spoke illustration the council of the gods shall then o tyrant of the ethereal reign my schemes my labours and my hopes be vain have i for this shook ilion with alarms assembled nations set two worlds in arms to spread the war i flew from shore to shore the immortal coursers scarce the labour bore at length ripe vengeance oer their heads impends but jove himself the faithless race defends loth as thou art to punish lawless lust not all the gods are partial and unjust the sire whose thunder shakes the cloudy skies sighs from his inmost soul and thus replies oh lasting rancour oh insatiate hate to phrygias monarch and the phrygian state what high offence has fired the wife of jove can wretched mortals harm the powers above that troy and troys whole race thou wouldst confound and yon fair structures level with the ground haste leave the skies fulfil thy stern desire burst all her gates and wrap her walls in fire let priam bleed if yet you thirst for more bleed all his sons and ilion float with gore to boundless vengeance the wide realm be given till vast destruction glut the queen of heaven so let it be and jove his peace enjoy when heaven no longer hears the name of troy but should this arm prepare to wreak our hate on thy loved realms whose guilt demands their fate presume not thou the lifted bolt to stay remember troy and give the vengeance way for know of all the numerous towns that rise beneath the rolling sun and starry skies which gods have raised or earthborn men enjoy none stands so dear to jove as sacred troy no mortals merit more distinguishd grace than godlike priam or than priams race still to our name their hecatombs expire and altars blaze with unextinguishd fire at this the goddess rolled her radiant eyes then on the thunderer fixd them and replies three towns are junos on the grecian plains more dear than all the extended earth contains mycen argos and the spartan wall these thou mayst raze nor i forbid their fall tis not in me the vengeance to remove the crimes sufficient that they share my love of power superior why should i complain resent i may but must resent in vain yet some distinction juno might require sprung with thyself from one celestial sire a goddess born to share the realms above and styled the consort of the thundering jove nor thou a wife and sisters right deny let both consent and both by terms comply so shall the gods our joint decrees obey and heaven shall act as we direct the way see ready pallas waits thy high commands to raise in arms the greek and phrygian bands their sudden friendship by her arts may cease and the proud trojans first infringe the peace the sire of men and monarch of the sky the advice approved and bade minerva fly dissolve the league and all her arts employ to make the breach the faithless act of troy fired with the charge she headlong urged her flight and shot like lightning from olympus height as the red comet from saturnius sent to fright the nations with a dire portent a fatal sign to armies on the plain or trembling sailors on the wintry main with sweeping glories glides along in air and shakes the sparkles from its blazing hair between both armies thus in open sight shot the bright goddess in a trail of light with eyes erect the gazing hosts admire the power descending and the heavens on fire the gods they cried the gods this signal sent and fate now labours with some vast event jove seals the league or bloodier scenes prepares jove the great arbiter of peace and wars they said while pallas through the trojan throng in shape a mortal passd disguised along like bold laodocus her course she bent who from antenor traced his high descent amidst the ranks lycaons son she found the warlike pandarus for strength renownd whose squadrons led from black sepus flood with flaming shields in martial circle stood to him the goddess phrygian canst thou hear a welltimed counsel with a willing ear what praise were thine couldst thou direct thy dart amidst his triumph to the spartans heart what gifts from troy from paris wouldst thou gain thy countrys foe the grecian glory slain then seize the occasion dare the mighty deed aim at his breast and may that aim succeed but first to speed the shaft address thy vow to lycian phbus with the silver bow and swear the firstlings of thy flock to pay on zelias altars to the god of day he heard and madly at the motion pleased his polishd bow with hasty rashness seized twas formd of horn and smoothd with artful toil a mountain goat resignd the shining spoil who pierced long since beneath his arrows bled the stately quarry on the cliffs lay dead and sixteen palms his brows large honours spread the workmen joind and shaped the bended horns and beaten gold each taper point adorns this by the greeks unseen the warrior bends screend by the shields of his surrounding friends there meditates the mark and couching low fits the sharp arrow to the wellstrung bow one from a hundred featherd deaths he chose fated to wound and cause of future woes then offers vows with hecatombs to crown apollos altars in his native town now with full force the yielding horn he bends drawn to an arch and joins the doubling ends close to his breast he strains the nerve below till the barbd points approach the circling bow the impatient weapon whizzes on the wing sounds the tough horn and twangs the quivering string but thee atrides in that dangerous hour the gods forget not nor thy guardian power pallas assists and weakened in its force diverts the weapon from its destined course so from her babe when slumber seals his eye the watchful mother wafts the envenomd fly just where his belt with golden buckles joind where linen folds the double corslet lined she turnd the shaft which hissing from above passd the broad belt and through the corslet drove the folds it pierced the plaited linen tore and razed the skin and drew the purple gore as when some stately trappings are decreed to grace a monarch on his bounding steed a nymph in caria or monia bred stains the pure ivory with a lively red with equal lustre various colours vie the shining whiteness and the tyrian dye so great atrides showd thy sacred blood as down thy snowy thigh distilld the streaming flood with horror seized the king of men descried the shaft infixd and saw the gushing tide nor less the spartan feard before he found the shining barb appear above the wound then with a sigh that heaved his manly breast the royal brother thus his grief expressd and graspd his hand while all the greeks around with answering sighs returnd the plaintive sound oh dear as life did i for this agree the solemn truce a fatal truce to thee wert thou exposed to all the hostile train to fight for greece and conquer to be slain the race of trojans in thy ruin join and faith is scornd by all the perjured line not thus our vows confirmd with wine and gore those hands we plighted and those oaths we swore shall all be vain when heavens revenge is slow jove but prepares to strike the fiercer blow the day shall come that great avenging day when troys proud glories in the dust shall lay when priams powers and priams self shall fall and one prodigious ruin swallow all i see the god already from the pole bare his red arm and bid the thunder roll i see the eternal all his fury shed and shake his gis oer their guilty head such mighty woes on perjured princes wait but thou alas deservst a happier fate still must i mourn the period of thy days and only mourn without my share of praise deprived of thee the heartless greeks no more shall dream of conquests on the hostile shore troy seized of helen and our glory lost thy bones shall moulder on a foreign coast while some proud trojan thus insulting cries and spurns the dust where menelaus lies such are the trophies greece from ilion brings and such the conquest of her king of kings lo his proud vessels scatterd oer the main and unrevenged his mighty brother slain oh ere that dire disgrace shall blast my fame oerwhelm me earth and hide a monarchs shame he said a leaders and a brothers fears possess his soul which thus the spartan cheers let not thy words the warmth of greece abate the feeble dart is guiltless of my fate stiff with the rich embroiderd work around my varied belt repelld the flying wound to whom the king my brother and my friend thus always thus may heaven thy life defend now seek some skilful hand whose powerful art may stanch the effusion and extract the dart herald be swift and bid machaon bring his speedy succour to the spartan king pierced with a winged shaft the deed of troy the grecians sorrow and the dardans joy with hasty zeal the swift talthybius flies through the thick files he darts his searching eyes and finds machaon where sublime he stands in arms incircled with his native bands then thus machaon to the king repair his wounded brother claims thy timely care pierced by some lycian or dardanian bow a grief to us a triumph to the foe the heavy tidings grieved the godlike man swift to his succour through the ranks he ran the dauntless king yet standing firm he found and all the chiefs in deep concern around where to the steely point the reed was joind the shaft he drew but left the head behind straight the broad belt with gay embroidery graced he loosed the corslet from his breast unbraced then suckd the blood and sovereign balm infused which chiron gave and sculapius used while round the prince the greeks employ their care the trojans rush tumultuous to the war once more they glitter in refulgent arms once more the fields are filld with dire alarms nor had you seen the king of men appear confused unactive or surprised with fear but fond of glory with severe delight his beating bosom claimd the rising fight no longer with his warlike steeds he stayd or pressd the car with polishd brass inlaid but left eurymedon the reins to guide the fiery coursers snorted at his side on foot through all the martial ranks he moves and these encourages and those reproves brave men he cries to such who boldly dare urge their swift steeds to face the coming war your ancient valour on the foes approve jove is with greece and let us trust in jove tis not for us but guilty troy to dread whose crimes sit heavy on her perjured head her sons and matrons greece shall lead in chains and her dead warriors strew the mournful plains thus with new ardour he the brave inspires or thus the fearful with reproaches fires shame to your country scandal of your kind born to the fate ye well deserve to find why stand ye gazing round the dreadful plain prepared for flight but doomd to fly in vain confused and panting thus the hunted deer falls as he flies a victim to his fear still must ye wait the foes and still retire till yon tall vessels blaze with trojan fire or trust ye jove a valiant foe shall chase to save a trembling heartless dastard race this said he stalkd with ample strides along to cretes brave monarch and his martial throng high at their head he saw the chief appear and bold meriones excite the rear at this the king his generous joy expressd and claspd the warrior to his armed breast divine idomeneus what thanks we owe to worth like thine what praise shall we bestow to thee the foremost honours are decreed first in the fight and every graceful deed for this in banquets when the generous bowls restore our blood and raise the warriors souls though all the rest with stated rules we bound unmixd unmeasured are thy goblets crownd be still thyself in arms a mighty name maintain thy honours and enlarge thy fame to whom the cretan thus his speech addressd secure of me o king exhort the rest fixd to thy side in every toil i share thy firm associate in the day of war but let the signal be this moment given to mix in fight is all i ask of heaven the field shall prove how perjuries succeed and chains or death avenge the impious deed charmd with this heat the king his course pursues and next the troops of either ajax views in one firm orb the bands were ranged around a cloud of heroes blackend all the ground thus from the lofty promontorys brow a swain surveys the gathering storm below slow from the main the heavy vapours rise spread in dim streams and sail along the skies till black as night the swelling tempest shows the cloud condensing as the westwind blows he dreads the impending storm and drives his flock to the close covert of an arching rock such and so thick the embattled squadrons stood with spears erect a moving iron wood a shady light was shot from glimmering shields and their brown arms obscured the dusky fields o heroes worthy such a dauntless train whose godlike virtue we but urge in vain exclaimd the king who raise your eager bands with great examples more than loud commands ah would the gods but breathe in all the rest such souls as burn in your exalted breast soon should our arms with just success be crownd and troys proud walls lie smoking on the ground then to the next the general bends his course his heart exults and glories in his force there reverend nestor ranks his pylian bands

fight or fall a firm embodied train he whom the fortune of the field shall cast from forth his chariot mount the next in haste nor seek unpractised to direct the car content with javelins to provoke the war our great forefathers held this prudent course thus ruled their ardour thus preserved their force by laws like these immortal conquests made and earths proud tyrants low in ashes laid so spoke the master of the martial art and touchd with transport great atrides heart oh hadst thou strength to match thy brave desires and nerves to second what thy soul inspires but wasting years that wither human race exhaust thy spirits and thy arms unbrace what once thou wert oh ever mightst thou be and age the lot of any chief but thee thus to the experienced prince atrides cried he shook his hoary locks and thus replied well might i wish could mortal wish renew that strength which once in boiling youth i knew such as i was when ereuthalion slain beneath this arm fell prostrate on the plain but heaven its gifts not all at once bestows these years with wisdom crowns with action those the field of combat fits the young and bold the solemn council best becomes the old to you the glorious conflict i resign let sage advice the palm of age be mine he said with joy the monarch marchd before and found menestheus on the dusty shore with whom the firm athenian phalanx stands and next ulysses with his subject bands remote their forces lay nor knew so far the peace infringed nor heard the sounds of war the tumult late begun they stood intent to watch the motion dubious of the event the king who saw their squadrons yet unmoved with hasty ardour thus the chiefs reproved can peleus son forget a warriors part and fears ulysses skilld in every art why stand you distant and the rest expect to mix in combat which yourselves neglect from you twas hoped among the first to dare the shock of armies and commence the war for this your names are calld before the rest to share the pleasures of the genial feast and can you chiefs without a blush survey whole troops before you labouring in the fray say is it thus those honours you requite the first in banquets but the last in fight ulysses heard the heros warmth oerspread his cheek with blushes and severe he said take back the unjust reproach behold we stand sheathed in bright arms and but expect command if glorious deeds afford thy soul delight behold me plunging in the thickest fight then give thy warriorchief a warriors due who dares to act whateer thou darst to view struck with his generous wrath the king replies o great in action and in council wise with ours thy care and ardour are the same nor need i to commend nor aught to blame sage as thou art and learnd in human kind forgive the transport of a martial mind haste to the fight secure of just amends the gods that make shall keep the worthy friends he said and passd where great tydides lay his steeds and chariots wedged in firm array the warlike sthenelus attends his side to whom with stern reproach the monarch cried o son of tydeus he whose strength could tame the bounding steed in arms a mighty name canst thou remote the mingling hosts descry with hands unactive and a careless eye not thus thy sire the fierce encounter feard still first in front the matchless prince appeard what glorious toils what wonders they recite who viewd him labouring through the ranks of fight i saw him once when gathering martial powers a peaceful guest he sought mycens towers armies he askd and armies had been given not we denied but jove forbade from heaven while dreadful comets glaring from afar forewarnd the horrors of the theban war next sent by greece from where asopus flows a fearless envoy he approachd the foes thebes hostile walls unguarded and alone dauntless he enters and demands the throne the tyrant feasting with his chiefs he found and dared to combat all those chiefs around dared and subdued before their haughty lord for pallas strung his arm and edged his sword stung with the shame within the winding way to bar his passage fifty warriors lay two heroes led the secret squadron on mason the fierce and hardy lycophon those fifty slaughterd in the gloomy vale he spared but one to bear the dreadful tale such tydeus was and such his martial fire gods how the son degenerates from the sire no words the godlike diomed returnd but heard respectful and in secret burnd not so fierce capaneus undaunted son stern as his sire the boaster thus begun what needs o monarch this invidious praise ourselves to lessen while our sire you raise dare to be just atrides and confess our value equal though our fury less with fewer troops we stormd the theban wall and happier saw the sevenfold city fall in impious acts the guilty father died the sons subdued for heaven was on their side far more than heirs of all our parents fame our glories darken their diminishd name to him tydides thus my friend forbear suppress thy passion and the king revere his high concern may well excuse this rage whose cause we follow and whose war we wage his the first praise were ilions towers oerthrown and if we fail the chief disgrace his own let him the greeks to hardy toils excite tis ours to labour in the glorious fight he spoke and ardent on the trembling ground sprung from his car his ringing arms resound dire was the clang and dreadful from afar of armd tydides rushing to the war as when the winds ascending by degrees first move the whitening surface of the seas the billows float in order to the shore the wave behind rolls on the wave before till with the growing storm the deeps arise foam oer the rocks and thunder to the skies so to the fight the thick battalions throng shields urged on shields and men drove men along sedate and silent move the numerous bands no sound no whisper but the chiefs commands those only heard with awe the rest obey as if some god had snatchd their voice away not so the trojans from their host ascends a general shout that all the region rends as when the fleecy flocks unnumberd stand in wealthy folds and wait the milkers hand the hollow vales incessant bleating fills the lambs reply from all the neighbouring hills such clamours rose from various nations round mixd was the murmur and confused the sound each host now joins and each a god inspires these mars incites and those minerva fires pale flight around and dreadful terror reign and discord raging bathes the purple plain discord dire sister of the slaughtering power small at her birth but rising every hour while scarce the skies her horrid head can bound she stalks on earth and shakes the world around the nations bleed whereer her steps she turns the groan still deepens and the combat burns now shield with shield with helmet helmet closed to armour armour lance to lance opposed host against host with shadowy squadrons drew the sounding darts in iron tempests flew victors and vanquishd joind promiscuous cries and shrilling shouts and dying groans arise with streaming blood the slippery fields are dyed and slaughterd heroes swell the dreadful tide as torrents roll increased by numerous rills with rage impetuous down their echoing hills rush to the vales and pourd along the plain roar through a thousand channels to the main the distant shepherd trembling hears the sound so mix both hosts and so their cries rebound the bold antilochus the slaughter led the first who struck a valiant trojan dead at great echepolus the lance arrives razed his high crest and through his helmet drives warmd in the brain the brazen weapon lies and shades eternal settle oer his eyes so sinks a tower that long assaults had stood of force and fire its walls besmeard with blood him the bold leader of the abantian throng seized to despoil and draggd the corpse along but while he strove to tug the inserted dart agenors javelin reachd the heros heart his flank unguarded by his ample shield admits the lance he falls and spurns the field the nerves

engage man dies on man and all is blood and rage in blooming youth fair simoisius fell sent by great ajax to the shades of hell fair simoisius whom his mother bore amid the flocks on silver simois shore the nymph descending from the hills of ide to seek her parents on his flowery side brought forth the babe their common care and joy and thence from simois named the lovely boy short was his date

wise ulysses slew he drops the corpse of simoisius slain and sinks a breathless carcase on the plain this saw ulysses and with grief enraged strode where the foremost of the foes engaged armd with his spear he meditates the wound in act to throw but cautious lookd around struck at his sight the trojans backward drew and trembling heard the javelin as it flew a chief stood nigh who from abydos came old priams son democoon was his name the weapon entered close above his ear cold through his temples glides the whizzing spear with piercing shrieks the youth resigns his breath his eyeballs darken with the shades of death ponderous he falls his clanging arms resound and his broad buckler rings against the ground seized with affright the boldest foes appear een godlike hector seems himself to fear slow he gave way the rest tumultuous fled the greeks with shouts press on and spoil the dead but phbus now from ilions towering height shines forth reveald and animates the fight trojans be bold and force with force oppose your foaming steeds urge headlong on the foes nor are their bodies rocks nor ribbd with steel your weapons enter and your strokes they feel have ye forgot what seemd your dread before the great the fierce achilles fights no more apollo thus from ilions lofty towers arrayd in terrors roused the trojan powers while wars fierce goddess fires the grecian foe and shouts and thunders in the fields below then great diores fell by doom divine in vain his valour and illustrious line a broken rock the force of pyrus threw who from cold nus led the thracian crew full on his ankle droppd the ponderous stone burst the strong nerves and crashd the solid bone supine he tumbles on the crimson sands before his helpless friends and native bands and spreads for aid his unavailing hands the foe rushd furious as he pants for breath and through his navel drove the pointed death his gushing entrails smoked upon the ground and the warm life came issuing from the wound his lance bold thoas at the conqueror sent deep in his breast above the pap it went amid the lungs was fixd the winged wood and quivering in his heaving bosom stood till from the dying chief approaching near the tolian warrior tuggd his weighty spear then sudden waved his flaming falchion round and gashd his belly with a ghastly wound the corpse now breathless on the bloody plain to spoil his arms the victor strove in vain the thracian bands against the victor pressd a grove of lances glitterd at his breast stern thoas glaring with revengeful eyes in sullen fury slowly quits the prize thus fell two heroes one the pride of thrace and one the leader of the epeian race deaths sable shade at once oercast their eyes in dust the vanquishd and the victor lies with copious slaughter all the fields are red and heapd with growing mountains of the dead had some brave chief this martial scene beheld by pallas guarded through the dreadful field might darts be bid to turn their points away

triumphantly expired illustration map of the plain of troy book v argument the acts of diomed diomed assisted by pallas performs wonders in this days battle pandarus wounds him with an arrow but the goddess cures him enables him to discern gods from mortals and prohibits him from contending with any of the former excepting venus neas joins pandarus to oppose him pandarus is killed and neas in

and crown her hero with distinguishd praise high on his helm celestial lightnings play his beamy shield emits a living ray the unwearied blaze incessant streams supplies like the red star that fires the autumnal skies when fresh he rears his radiant orb to sight and bathed in ocean shoots a keener light such glories pallas on the chief bestowd such from his arms the fierce effulgence flowd onward

first bold phegeus cast his sounding spear which oer the warriors shoulder took its course and spent in empty air its erring force not so tydides flew thy lance in vain but pierced his breast and stretchd him on the plain seized with unusual fear idus fled left the rich chariot and his brother dead and had not vulcan lent celestial aid he too had sunk to deaths eternal shade but in a smoky cloud the god of fire preserved the son in pity to the sire the steeds and chariot to the navy led increased the spoils of gallant diomed struck with amaze and shame the trojan crew or slain or fled

impetuous warriors heat the god of arms and martial maid retreat removed from fight on xanthus flowery bounds they sat and listend to the dying sounds meantime the greeks the trojan race pursue and some bold chieftain every leader slew first odius falls and bites the bloody sand his death ennobled by atrides hand as he to flight his wheeling car addressd the speedy javelin drove from back to

from fruitful tarne to the fields of troy the cretan javelin reachd him from afar and pierced his shoulder as he mounts his car back from the car he tumbles to the ground and everlasting shades his eyes surround then died scamandrius expert in the chase in woods and wilds to wound the savage race diana taught him all her sylvan arts to bend the bow and aim unerring darts but vainly here dianas arts he tries the fatal lance arrests him as he flies from menelaus arm the weapon sent through his broad back and heaving bosom went down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound his brazen armour rings against the ground next artful phereclus untimely fell bold merion sent him to the realms of hell thy fathers skill o phereclus was thine the graceful fabric and the fair design for loved by pallas pallas did impart to him the shipwrights and the builders art beneath his hand the fleet of paris rose the fatal cause of all his countrys woes but he the mystic will of heaven unknown nor saw his countrys peril nor his own the hapless artist while confused he fled the spear of merion mingled with the dead through his right hip with forceful fury cast between the bladder and the bone it passd prone on his knees he falls with fruitless cries and death in lasting slumber seals his eyes from meges force the swift pedaeus fled antenors offspring from a foreign bed whose generous spouse theanor heavenly fair nursed the young stranger with a mothers care how vain those cares when meges in the rear full in his nape infixd the fatal spear swift through his crackling jaws the weapon glides and the cold tongue and grinning teeth divides then died hypsenor generous and divine sprung from the brave dolopions mighty line who near adored scamander made abode priest of the stream and honoured as a god on him amidst the flying numbers found eurypylus inflicts a deadly wound on his broad shoulders fell the forceful brand thence glancing downwards loppd his holy hand which staind with sacred blood the blushing sand down sunk the priest the purple hand of death closed his dim eye and fate suppressd his breath thus toild the chiefs in different parts engaged in every quarter fierce tydides raged amid the greek amid the trojan train rapt through the ranks he thunders oer the plain now here now there he darts from place to place pours on the rear or lightens in their face thus from high hills the torrents swift and strong deluge whole fields and sweep the trees along through ruind moles the rushing wave resounds oerwhelms the bridge and bursts the lofty bounds the yellow harvests of the ripend year and flatted vineyards one sad waste appear while jove descends in sluicy sheets of rain and all the labours of mankind are vain so raged tydides boundless in his ire drove armies back and made all troy retire with grief the leader of the lycian band saw the wide waste of his destructive hand his bended bow against the chief he drew swift to the mark the thirsty arrow flew whose forky point the hollow breastplate tore deep in his shoulder pierced and drank the gore the rushing stream his brazen armour dyed while the proud archer thus exulting cried hither ye trojans hither drive your steeds lo by our hand the bravest grecian bleeds not long the deathful dart he can sustain or phbus urged me to these fields in vain so spoke he boastful but the winged dart stoppd short of life and mockd the shooters art the wounded chief behind his car retired the helping hand of sthenelus required swift from his seat he leapd upon the ground and tuggd the weapon from the gushing wound when thus the king his guardian power addressd the purple current wandering oer his vest o progeny of jove unconquerd maid if eer my godlike sire deserved thy aid if eer i felt thee in the fighting field now goddess now thy sacred succour yield o give my lance to reach the trojan knight whose arrow wounds the chief thou guardst in fight and lay the boaster grovelling on the shore that vaunts these eyes shall view the light no more thus prayd tydides and minerva heard his nerves confirmd his languid spirits cheerd he feels each limb with wonted vigour light his beating bosom claimd the promised fight be bold she cried in every combat shine war be thy province thy protection mine rush to the fight and every foe control wake each paternal virtue in thy soul strength swells thy boiling breast infused by me and all thy godlike father breathes in thee yet more from mortal mists i purge thy eyes and set to view the warring deities these see thou shun through all the embattled plain nor rashly strive where human force is vain if venus mingle in the martial band her shalt thou wound so pallas gives command with that the blueeyed virgin wingd her flight the hero rushd impetuous to the fight with tenfold ardour now invades the plain wild with delay and more enraged by pain as on the fleecy flocks when hunger calls amidst the field a brindled lion falls if chance some shepherd with a distant dart the savage wound he rouses at the smart he foams he roars the shepherd dares not stay but trembling leaves the scattering flocks a prey heaps fall on heaps he bathes with blood the ground then leaps victorious oer the lofty mound not with less fury stern tydides flew and two brave leaders at an instant slew astynous breathless fell and by his side his peoples pastor good hypenor died astynous breast the deadly lance receives hypenors shoulder his broad falchion cleaves those slain he left and sprung with noble rage abas and polyidus to engage sons of eurydamus who wise and old could fate foresee and mystic dreams unfold the youths returnd not from the doubtful plain and the sad father tried his arts in vain no mystic dream could make their fates appear though now determined by tydides spear young xanthus next and thoon felt his rage the joy and hope of phaenops feeble age vast was his wealth and these the only heirs of all his labours and a life of cares cold death oertakes them in their blooming years and leaves the father unavailing tears to strangers now descends his heapy store the race forgotten and the name no more two sons of priam in one chariot ride glittering in arms and combat side by side as when the lordly lion seeks his food where grazing heifers range the lonely wood he leaps amidst them with a furious bound bends their strong necks and tears them to the ground so from their seats the brother chiefs are torn their steeds and chariot to the navy borne with deep concern divine neas viewd the foe prevailing and his friends pursued through the thick storm of singing spears he flies exploring pandarus with careful eyes at length he found lycaons mighty son to whom the chief of venus race begun where pandarus are all thy honours now thy winged arrows and unerring bow thy matchless skill thy yet unrivalld fame and boasted glory of the lycian name o pierce that mortal if we mortal call that wondrous force by which whole armies fall or god incensed who quits the distant skies to punish troy for slighted sacrifice which oh avert from our unhappy state for what so dreadful as celestial hate whoeer he be propitiate jove with prayer if man destroy if god entreat to spare to him the lycian whom your eyes behold if right i judge is diomed the bold such coursers whirl him oer the dusty field so towers his helmet and so flames his shield if tis a god he wears that chiefs disguise or if that chief some guardian of the skies involved in clouds protects him in the fray and turns unseen the frustrate dart away i wingd an arrow which not idly fell the stroke had fixd him to the gates of hell and but some god some angry god withstands his fate was due to these unerring hands skilld in the bow on foot i sought the war nor joind swift horses to the rapid car ten polishd chariots i possessd at home and still they grace lycaons princely dome there veild in spacious coverlets they stand and twice ten coursers wait their lords command the good old warrior bade me trust to these when first for troy i saild the sacred seas in fields aloft the whirling car to guide and through the ranks of death triumphant ride but vain with youth and yet to thrift inclined i heard his counsels with unheedful mind and thought the steeds your large supplies unknown might fail of forage in the straitend town so took my bow and pointed darts in hand and left the chariots in my native land too late o friend my rashness i deplore these shafts once fatal carry death no more tydeus and atreus sons their points have found and undissembled gore pursued the wound in vain they bleed this unavailing bow serves not to slaughter but provoke the foe in evil hour these bended horns i strung and seized the quiver where it idly hung cursed be the fate that sent me to the field without a warriors arms the spear and shield if eer with life i quit the trojan plain if eer i see my spouse and sire again this bow unfaithful to my glorious aims broke by my hand shall feed the blazing flames to whom the leader of the dardan race be calm nor phbus honourd gift disgrace the distant dart be praised though here we need the rushing chariot and the bounding steed against yon hero let us bend our course and hand to hand encounter force with force now mount my seat and from the chariots height observe my fathers steeds renownd in fight practised alike to turn to stop to chase to dare the shock or urge the rapid race secure with these through fighting fields we go or safe to troy if jove assist the foe haste seize the whip and snatch the guiding rein the warriors fury let this arm sustain or if to combat thy bold heart incline take thou the spear the chariots care be mine o prince lycaons valiant son replied as thine the steeds be thine the task to guide the horses practised to their lords command shall bear the rein and answer to thy hand but if unhappy we desert the fight thy voice alone can animate their flight else shall our fates be numberd with the dead and these the victors prize in triumph led thine be the guidance then with spear and shield myself will charge this terror of the field and now both heroes mount the glittering car the bounding coursers rush amidst the war their fierce approach bold sthenelus espied who thus alarmd to great tydides cried o friend two chiefs of force immense i see dreadful they come and bend their rage on thee lo the brave heir of old lycaons line and great neas sprung from race divine enough is given to fame ascend thy car and save a life the bulwark of our war at this the hero cast a gloomy look fixd on the chief with scorn and thus he spoke me dost thou bid to shun the coming fight me wouldst thou move to base inglorious flight know tis not honest in my soul to fear nor was tydides born to tremble here i hate the cumbrous chariots slow advance and the long distance of the flying lance but while my nerves are strong my force entire thus front the foe and emulate my sire nor shall yon steeds that fierce to fight convey those threatening heroes bear them both away one chief at least beneath this arm shall die so pallas tells me and forbids to fly but if she dooms and if no god withstand that both shall fall by one victorious hand then heed my words my horses here detain fixd to the chariot by the straitend rein swift to neas empty seat proceed and seize the coursers of ethereal breed the race of those which once the thundering god for ravishd ganymede on tros bestowd the best that eer on earths broad surface run beneath the rising or the setting sun hence great anchises stole a breed unknown by mortal mares from fierce laomedon four of this race his ample stalls contain and two transport neas oer the plain these were the rich immortal prize our own through the wide world should make our glory known thus while they spoke the foe came furious on and stern lycaons warlike race begun prince thou art met though late in vain assaild the spear may enter where the arrow faild he said then shook the ponderous lance and flung on his broad shield the sounding weapon rung pierced the tough orb and in his cuirass hung he bleeds the pride of greece the boaster cries our triumph now the mighty warrior lies mistaken vaunter diomed replied thy dart has erred and now my spear be tried ye scape not both one headlong from his car with hostile blood shall glut the god of war he spoke and rising hurld his forceful dart which driven by pallas pierced a vital part full in his face it enterd and betwixt the nose and eyeball the proud lycian fixd crashd all his jaws and cleft the tongue within till the bright point lookd out beneath the chin headlong he falls his helmet knocks the ground earth groans beneath him and his arms resound the starting coursers tremble with affright the soul indignant seeks the realms of night to guard his slaughterd friend neas flies his spear extending where the carcase lies watchful he wheels protects it every way as the grim lion stalks around his prey oer the falln trunk his ample shield displayd he hides the hero with his mighty shade and threats aloud the greeks with longing eyes behold at distance but forbear the prize then fierce tydides stoops and from the fields heaved with vast force a rocky fragment wields not two strong men the enormous weight could raise such men as live in these degenerate days he swung it round and gathering strength to throw discharged the ponderous ruin at the foe where to the hip the inserted thigh unites full on the bone the pointed marble lights through both the tendons broke the rugged stone and strippd the skin and crackd the solid bone sunk on his knees and staggering with his pains his falling bulk his bended arm sustains lost in a dizzy mist the warrior lies a sudden cloud comes swimming oer his eyes there the brave chief who mighty numbers swayd oppressd had sunk to deaths eternal shade but heavenly venus mindful of the love she bore anchises in the idaean grove his danger views with anguish and despair and guards her offspring with a mothers care about her muchloved son her arms she throws her arms whose whiteness match the falling snows screend from the foe behind her shining veil the swords wave harmless and the javelins fail safe through the rushing horse and featherd flight of sounding shafts she bears him from the fight nor sthenelus with unassisting hands remaind unheedful of his lords commands his panting steeds removed from out the war he fixd with straitend traces to the car next rushing to the dardan spoil detains the heavenly coursers with the flowing manes these in proud triumph to the fleet conveyd no longer now a trojan lord obeyd that charge to bold deipylus he gave whom most he loved as brave men love the brave then mounting on his car resumed the rein and followd where tydides swept the plain meanwhile his conquest ravished from his eyes the raging chief in chase of venus flies no goddess she commissiond to the field like pallas dreadful with her sable shield or fierce bellona thundering at the wall while flames ascend and mighty ruins fall he knew soft combats suit the tender dame new to the field and still a foe to fame through breaking ranks his furious course he bends and at the goddess his broad lance extends through her bright veil the daring weapon drove the ambrosial veil which all the graces wove her snowy hand the razing steel profaned and the transparent skin with crimson staind from the clear vein a stream immortal flowd such stream as issues from a wounded god pure emanation uncorrupted flood unlike our gross diseased terrestrial blood for not the bread of man their life sustains nor wines inflaming juice supplies their veins with tender shrieks the goddess filld the place and droppd her offspring from her weak embrace him phbus took he casts a cloud around the fainting chief and wards the mortal wound then with a voice that shook the vaulted skies the king insults the goddess as she flies ill with joves daughter bloody fights agree the field of combat is no scene for thee go let thy own soft sex employ thy care go lull the coward or delude the fair taught by this stroke renounce the wars alarms and learn to tremble at the name of arms tydides thus the goddess seized with dread confused distracted from the conflict fled to aid her swift the winged iris flew wrapt in a mist above the warring crew the queen of love with faded charms she found pale was her cheek and livid lookd the wound to mars who sat remote they bent their way far on the left with clouds involved he lay beside him stood his lance distaind with gore and reind with gold his foaming steeds before low at his knee she beggd with streaming eyes her brothers car to mount the distant skies and showd the wound by fierce tydides given a mortal man who dares encounter heaven stern mars attentive hears the queen complain and to her hand commits the golden rein she mounts the seat oppressd with silent woe driven by the goddess of the painted bow the lash resounds the rapid chariot flies and in a moment scales the lofty skies they stoppd the car and there the coursers stood fed by fair iris with ambrosial food before her mother loves bright queen appears oerwhelmed with anguish and dissolved in tears she raised her in her arms beheld her bleed and askd what god had wrought this guilty deed illustration venus wounded in the hand conducted by iris to mars then she this insult from no god i found an impious mortal gave the daring wound behold the deed of haughty diomed twas in the sons defence the mother bled the war with troy no more the grecians wage but with the gods the immortal gods engage dione then thy wrongs with patience bear and share those griefs inferior powers must share unnumberd woes mankind from us sustain and men with woes afflict the gods again the mighty mars in mortal fetters bound and lodged in brazen dungeons underground full thirteen moons imprisond roard in vain otus and ephialtes held the chain perhaps had perishd had not hermes care restored the groaning god to upper air great junos self has borne her weight of pain the imperial partner of the heavenly reign amphitryons son infixd the deadly dart and filld with anguish her immortal heart een hells grim king alcides power confessd the shaft found entrance in his iron breast to joves high palace for a cure he fled pierced in his own dominions of the dead where paeon sprinkling heavenly balm around assuaged the glowing pangs and closed the wound rash impious man to stain the blessd abodes and drench his arrows in the blood of gods illustration otus and ephialtes holding mars captive but thou though pallas urged thy frantic deed whose spear illfated makes a goddess bleed know thou whoeer with heavenly power contends short is his date and soon his glory ends from fields of death when late he shall retire no infant on his knees shall call him sire strong as thou art some god may yet be found to stretch thee pale and gasping on the ground thy distant wife gial the fair starting from sleep with a distracted air shall rouse thy slaves and her lost lord deplore the brave the great the glorious now no more this said she wiped from venus wounded palm the sacred ichor and infused the balm juno and pallas with a smile surveyd and thus to jove began the blueeyed maid permit thy daughter gracious jove to tell how this mischance the cyprian queen befell as late she tried with passion to inflame the tender bosom of a grecian dame allured the fair with moving thoughts of joy to quit her country for some youth of troy the clasping zone with golden buckles bound razed her soft hand with this lamented wound the sire of gods and men superior smiled and calling venus thus addressd his child not these o daughter are thy proper cares thee milder arts befit and softer wars sweet smiles are thine and kind endearing charms to mars and pallas leave the deeds of arms thus they in heaven while on the plain below the fierce tydides charged his dardan foe flushd with celestial blood pursued his way and fearless dared the threatening god of day already in his hopes he saw him killd though screend behind apollos mighty shield thrice rushing furious at the chief he strook his blazing buckler thrice apollo shook he tried the fourth when breaking from the cloud a more than mortal voice was heard aloud o son of tydeus cease be wise and see how vast the difference of the gods and thee distance immense between the powers that shine above eternal deathless and divine and mortal man a wretch of humble birth a shortlived reptile in the dust of earth so spoke the god who darts celestial fires he dreads his fury and some steps retires then phbus bore the chief of venus race to troys high fane and to his holy place latona there and phoebe heald the wound with vigour armd him

of life denies and thou must fall thy virtues sacrifice greece in her single heroes strove in vain now hosts oppose thee and thou must be slain o grant me gods ere hector meets his doom all i can ask of heaven an early tomb so shall my days in one sad tenor run and end with sorrows as they first begun no parent now remains my griefs to share no fathers aid no mothers tender care the fierce achilles wrapt our walls in fire laid thebe waste and slew my warlike sire his fate compassion in the victor bred stern as he was he yet revered the dead his radiant arms preserved from hostile spoil and laid him decent on the funeral pile then raised a mountain where his bones were burnd the mountainnymphs the rural tomb adornd joves sylvan daughters bade their elms bestow a barren shade and in his honour grow by the same arm my seven brave brothers fell in one sad day beheld the gates of hell while the fat herds and snowy flocks they fed amid their fields the hapless heroes bled my mother lived to wear the victors bands the queen of hippoplacias sylvan lands redeemd too late she scarce beheld again her pleasing empire and her native plain when ah oppressd by lifeconsuming woe she fell

agamemnon points his dreadful host that pass tydides ajax strive to gain and there the vengeful spartan fires his train thrice our bold foes the fierce attack have given or led by hopes or dictated from heaven let others in the field their arms employ but stay my hector here and guard his troy the chief replied that post shall be my care not that alone but all the works of war how would the sons of troy in arms renownd and troys proud dames whose garments sweep the ground attaint the lustre of my former name should hector basely quit the field of fame my early youth was bred to martial pains my soul impels me to the embattled plains let me be foremost to defend the throne and guard my fathers glories and my own yet come it will the day decreed by fates how my heart trembles while my tongue relates the day when thou imperial troy must bend and see thy warriors fall thy glories end and yet no dire presage so wounds my mind my mothers death the ruin of my kind not priams hoary hairs defiled with gore not all my brothers gasping on the shore as thine andromache thy griefs i dread i see thee trembling weeping captive led in argive looms our battles to design and woes of which so large a part was thine to bear the victors hard commands or bring the weight of waters from hyperias spring there while you groan beneath the load of life they cry behold the mighty hectors wife some haughty greek who lives thy tears to see imbitters all thy woes by naming me the thoughts of glory past and present shame a thousand griefs shall waken at the name may i lie cold before that dreadful day pressd with a load of monumental clay thy hector wrapt in everlasting sleep shall neither hear thee sigh nor see thee weep thus having spoke the illustrious chief of troy stretchd his fond arms to clasp the lovely boy the babe clung crying to his nurses breast scared at the dazzling helm and nodding crest with secret pleasure each fond parent smiled and hector hasted to relieve his child the glittering terrors from his brows unbound and placed the beaming helmet on the ground then kissd the child and lifting high in air thus to the gods preferrd a fathers prayer o thou whose glory fills the ethereal throne and all ye deathless powers protect my son grant him like me to purchase just renown to guard the trojans to defend the crown against his countrys foes the war to wage and rise the hector of the future age so when triumphant from successful toils of heroes slain he bears the reeking spoils whole hosts may hail him with deserved acclaim and say this chief transcends his fathers fame while pleased amidst the general shouts of troy his mothers conscious heart oerflows with joy he spoke and fondly gazing on her charms restored the pleasing burden to her arms soft on her fragrant breast the babe she laid hushd to repose and with a smile surveyd the troubled pleasure soon chastised by fear she mingled with a smile a tender tear the softend chief with kind compassion viewd and dried the falling drops and thus pursued andromache my souls far better part why with untimely sorrows heaves thy heart no hostile hand can antedate my doom till fate condemns me to the silent tomb fixd is the term to all the race of earth and such the hard condition of our birth no force can then resist no flight can save all sink alike the fearful and the brave no morebut hasten to thy tasks at home there guide the spindle and direct the loom me glory summons to the martial scene the field of combat is the sphere for men where heroes war the foremost place i claim the first in danger as the first in fame thus having said the glorious chief resumes his towery helmet black with shading plumes his princess parts with a prophetic sigh unwilling parts and oft reverts her eye that streamd at every look then moving slow sought her own palace and indulged her woe there while her tears deplored the godlike man through all her train the soft infection ran the pious maids their mingled sorrows shed and mourn the living hector as the dead but now no longer deaf to honours call forth issues paris from the palace wall in brazen arms that cast a gleamy ray swift through the town the warrior bends his way the wanton courser thus with reins unbound breaks from his stall and beats the trembling ground pamperd and proud he seeks the wonted tides and laves in height of blood his shining sides his head now freed he tosses to the skies his mane dishevelld oer his shoulders flies he snuffs the females in the distant plain and springs exulting to his fields again with equal triumph sprightly bold and gay in arms refulgent as the god of day the son of priam glorying in his might rushd forth with hector to the fields of fight and now the warriors passing on the way the graceful paris first excused his stay to whom the noble hector thus replied o chief in blood and now in arms allied thy power in war with justice none contest known is thy courage and thy strength confessd what pity sloth should seize a soul so brave or godlike paris live a womans slave my heart weeps blood at what the trojans say and hopes thy deeds shall wipe the stain away haste then in all

mourns and greece indignant through her seas returns illustration bows and bow case illustration iris book vii argument the single combat of hector and ajax the battle renewing with double ardour upon the return of hector minerva is under apprehensions for the greeks apollo seeing her descend from olympus joins her near the scan gate they agree to put off the general engagement for that day and incite hector to challenge the greeks to a single combat nine of the princes accepting the challenge the lot is cast and falls upon ajax these heroes after several attacks are parted by the night the trojans calling a council antenor purposes the delivery of helen to the greeks to which paris will not consent but offers to restore them her riches priam sends a herald to make this offer and to demand a truce for burning the dead the last of which only is agreed to by agamemnon when the funerals are performed the greeks pursuant to the advice of nestor erect a fortification to protect their fleet and camp flanked with towers and defended by a ditch and palisades neptune testifies his jealousy at this work but is pacified by a promise from jupiter both armies pass the night in feasting but jupiter disheartens the trojans with thunder and other signs of his wrath the three and twentieth day ends with the duel of hector and ajax the next day the truce is agreed another is taken up in the funeral rites of the slain and one more in building the fortification before the ships so that somewhat about three days is employed in this book the scene lies wholly in the field so spoke the guardian of the trojan state then rushd impetuous through the scan gate him paris followd to the dire alarms both breathing slaughter both resolved in arms as when to sailors labouring through the main that long have heaved the weary oar in vain jove bids at length the expected gales arise the gales blow grateful and the vessel flies so welcome these to troys desiring train the bands are cheerd the war awakes again bold paris first the work of death begun on great menestheus areithous son sprung from the fair philomedas embrace the pleasing arn was his native place then sunk eioneus to the

shoulder as he mounts his steeds headlong he tumbles his slack nerves unbound drop the cold useless members on the ground when now minerva saw her argives slain from vast olympus to the gleaming plain fierce she descends apollo marked her flight nor shot less swift from ilions towery height radiant they met beneath the beechen shade when thus apollo to the blueeyed maid what cause o daughter of almighty jove thus wings thy progress from the realms above once more impetuous dost thou bend thy way to give to greece the long divided day too much has troy already felt thy hate now breathe thy rage and hush the stern debate this day the business of the field suspend war soon shall kindle and great ilion bend since vengeful goddesses confederate join to raze her walls though built by hands divine to whom the progeny of jove replies i left for this the council of the skies but who shall bid conflicting hosts forbear what art shall calm the furious sons of war to her the god great hectors soul incite to dare the boldest greek to single fight till greece provoked from all her numbers show a warrior worthy to be hectors foe at this agreed the heavenly powers withdrew sage helenus their secret counsels knew hector inspired he sought to him addressd thus told the dictates of his sacred breast o son of priam let thy faithful ear receive my words thy friend and brother hear go forth persuasive and a while engage the warring nations to suspend their rage then dare the boldest of the hostile train to mortal combat on the listed plain for not this day shall end thy glorious date the gods have spoke it and their voice is fate he said the warrior heard the word with joy then with his spear restraind the youth of troy held by the midst athwart on either hand the squadrons part the expecting trojans stand great agamemnon bids the greeks forbear they breathe and hush the tumult of the war the athenian maid and glorious god of day with silent joy the settling hosts survey in form of vultures on the beechs height they sit conceald and wait the future fight the thronging troops obscure the dusky fields horrid with bristling spears and gleaming shields as when a general darkness veils the main soft zephyr curling the wide watry plain the waves scarce heave the face of ocean sleeps and a still horror saddens all the deeps thus in thick orders settling wide around at length composed they sit and shade the ground great hector first amidst both armies broke the solemn silence and their powers bespoke hear all ye trojan all ye grecian bands what my soul prompts and what some god commands great jove averse our warfare to compose oerwhelms the nations with new toils and woes war with a fiercer tide once more returns till ilion falls or till yon navy burns you then o princes of the greeks appear tis hector speaks and calls the gods to hear from all your troops select the boldest knight and him the boldest hector dares to fight here if i fall by chance of battle slain be his my spoil and his these arms remain but let my body to my friends returnd by trojan hands and trojan flames be burnd and if apollo in whose aid i trust shall stretch your daring champion in the dust if mine the glory to despoil the foe on phbus temple ill his arms bestow the breathless carcase to your navy sent greece on the shore shall raise a monument which when some future mariner surveys washd by broad hellesponts resounding seas thus shall he say a valiant greek lies there by hector slain the mighty man of war the stone shall tell your vanquishd heros name and distant ages learn the victors fame this fierce defiance greece astonishd heard blushd to refuse and to accept it feard stern menelaus first the silence broke and inly groaning thus opprobrious spoke women of greece o scandal of your race whose coward souls your manly form disgrace how great the shame when every age shall know that not a grecian met this noble foe go then resolve to earth from whence ye grew a heartless spiritless inglorious crew be what ye seem unanimated clay myself will dare the danger of the day tis mans bold task the generous strife to try but in the hands of god is victory these words scarce spoke with generous ardour pressd his manly limbs in azure arms he dressd that day atrides a superior hand had stretchd thee breathless on the hostile strand but all at once thy fury to compose the kings of greece an awful band arose even he their chief great agamemnon pressd thy daring hand and this advice addressd whither o menelaus wouldst thou run and tempt a fate which prudence bids thee shun grieved though thou art forbear the rash design great hectors arm is mightier far than thine even fierce achilles learnd its force to fear and trembling met this dreadful son of war sit thou secure amidst thy social band greece in our cause shall arm some powerful hand the mightiest warrior of the achaian name though bold and burning with desire of fame content the doubtful honour might forego so great the danger and so brave the foe he said and turnd his brothers vengeful mind he stoopd to reason and his rage resignd no longer bent to rush on certain harms his joyful friends unbrace his azure arms he from whose lips divine persuasion flows grave nestor then in graceful act arose thus to the kings he spoke what grief what shame attend on greece and all the grecian name how shall alas her hoary heroes mourn their sons degenerate and their race a scorn what tears shall down thy silvery beard be rolld o peleus old in arms in wisdom old once with what joy the generous prince would hear of every chief who fought this glorious war participate their fame and pleased inquire each name each action and each heros sire gods should he see our warriors trembling stand and trembling all before one hostile hand how would he lift his aged arms on high lament inglorious greece and beg to die oh would to all the immortal powers above minerva phbus and almighty jove years might again roll back my youth renew and give this arm the spring which once it knew when fierce in war where jardans waters fall i led my troops to pheas trembling wall and with the arcadian spears my prowess tried where celadon rolls down his rapid tide there ereuthalion braved us in the field proud areithous dreadful arms to wield great areithous known from shore to shore by the huge knotted iron mace he bore no lance he shook nor bent the twanging bow but broke with this the battle of the foe him not by manly force lycurgus slew whose guileful javelin from the thicket flew deep in a winding way his breast assailed nor aught the warriors thundering mace availd supine he fell those arms which mars before had given the vanquishd now the victor bore but when old age had dimmd lycurgus eyes to ereuthalion he consignd the prize furious with this he crushd our levelld bands and dared the trial of the strongest hands nor could the strongest hands his fury stay all saw and feard his huge tempestuous sway till i the youngest of the host appeard and youngest met whom all our army feard i fought the chief my arms minerva crownd prone fell the giant oer a length of ground what then i was o were your nestor now not hectors self should want an equal foe but warriors you that youthful vigour boast the flower of greece the examples of our host sprung from such fathers who such numbers sway can you stand trembling and desert the day his warm reproofs the listening kings inflame and nine the noblest of the grecian name upstarted fierce but far before the rest the king of men advanced his dauntless breast then bold tydides great in arms appeard and next his bulk gigantic ajax reard oleus followd idomen was there and merion dreadful as the god of war with these eurypylus and thoas stand and wise ulysses closed the daring band all these alike inspired with noble rage demand the fight to whom the pylian sage lest thirst of glory your brave souls divide what chief shall combat let the gods decide whom heaven shall choose be his the chance to raise his countrys fame his own immortal praise the lots produced each hero signs his own then in the generals helm the fates are thrown the people pray with lifted eyes and hands and vows like these ascend from all the bands grant thou almighty in whose hand is fate a worthy champion for the grecian state this task let ajax or tydides prove or he the king of kings beloved by jove old nestor shook the casque by heaven inspired leapd forth the lot of every greek desired this from the right to left the herald bears held out in order to the grecian peers each to his rival yields the mark unknown till godlike ajax finds the lot his own surveys the inscription with rejoicing eyes then casts before him and with transport cries warriors i claim the lot and arm with joy be mine the conquest of this chief of troy now while my brightest arms my limbs invest to saturns son be all your vows addressd but pray in secret lest the foes should hear and deem your prayers the mean effect of fear said i in secret no your vows declare in such a voice as fills the earth and air lives there a chief whom ajax ought to dread ajax in all the toils of battle bred from warlike salamis i drew my birth and born to combats fear no force on earth he said the troops with elevated eyes implore the god whose thunder rends the skies o father of mankind superior lord on lofty idas holy hill adored who in the highest heaven hast fixd thy throne supreme of gods unbounded and alone grant thou that telamon may bear away the praise and conquest of this doubtful day or if illustrious hector be thy care that both may claim it and that both may share now ajax braced his dazzling armour on sheathed in bright steel the giantwarrior shone he moves to combat with majestic pace so stalks in arms the grisly god of thrace when jove to punish faithless men prepares and gives whole nations to the waste of wars thus marchd the chief tremendous as a god grimly he smiled earth trembled as he strode his massy javelin quivering in his hand he stood the bulwark of the grecian band through every argive heart new transport ran all troy stood trembling at the mighty man even hector paused and with new doubt oppressd felt his great heart suspended in his breast twas vain to seek retreat and vain to fear himself had challenged and the foe drew near stern telamon behind his ample shield as from a brazen tower oerlookd the field huge was its orb with seven thick folds oercast of tough bullhides of solid brass the last the work of tychius who in hyl dwelld and in all arts of armoury excelld this ajax bore before his manly breast and threatening thus his adverse chief addressd hector approach my arm and singly know what strength thou hast and what the grecian foe achilles shuns the fight yet some there are not void of soul and not unskilld in war let him unactive on the seabeat shore indulge his wrath and aid our arms no more whole troops of heroes greece has yet to boast and sends thee one a sample of her host such as i am i come to prove thy might no morebe sudden and begin the fight o son of telamon thy countrys pride to ajax thus the trojan prince replied me as a boy or woman wouldst thou fright new to the field and trembling at the fight thou meetst a chief deserving of thy arms to combat born and bred amidst alarms i know to shift my ground remount the car turn charge and answer every call of war to right to left the dexterous lance i wield and bear thick battle on my sounding shield but open be our fight and bold each blow i steal no conquest from a noble foe he said and rising high above the field whirld the long lance against the sevenfold shield full on the brass descending from above through six bullhides the furious weapon drove till in the seventh it fixd then ajax threw through hectors shield the forceful javelin flew his corslet enters and his garment rends and glancing downwards near his flank descends the wary trojan shrinks and bending low beneath his buckler disappoints the blow from their bored shields the chiefs their javelins drew then close impetuous and the charge renew fierce as the mountainlions bathed in blood or foaming boars the terror of the wood at ajax hector his long lance extends the blunted point against the buckler bends but ajax watchful as his foe drew near drove through the trojan targe the knotty spear it reachd his neck with matchless strength impelld spouts the black gore and dims his shining shield yet ceased not hector thus but stooping down in his strong hand upheaved a flinty stone black craggy vast to this his force he bends full on the brazen boss the stone descends the hollow brass resounded with the shock then ajax seized the fragment of a rock applied each nerve and swinging round on high with force tempestuous let the ruin fly the huge stone thundering through his buckler broke his slackend knees received the numbing stroke great hector falls extended on the field his bulk supporting on the shatterd shield nor wanted heavenly aid apollos might confirmd his sinews and restored to fight and now both heroes their broad falchions drew in flaming circles round their heads they flew but then by heralds voice the word was given the sacred ministers of earth and heaven divine talthybius whom the greeks employ and sage idus on the part of troy between the swords their peaceful sceptres reard and first idus awful voice was heard illustration hector and ajax separated by the heralds forbear my sons your further force to prove both dear to men and both beloved of jove to either host your matchless worth is known each sounds your praise and war is all your own but now the night extends her awful shade the goddess parts you be the night obeyd to whom great ajax his high soul expressd o sage to hector be these words addressd let him who first provoked our chiefs to fight let him demand the sanction of the night if first he askd it i content obey and cease the strife when hector shows the way o first of greeks his noble foe rejoind whom heaven adorns superior to thy kind with strength of body and with worth of mind now martial law commands us to forbear hereafter we shall meet in glorious war some future day shall lengthen out the strife and let the gods decide of death or life since then the night extends her gloomy shade and heaven enjoins it be the night obeyd return brave ajax to thy grecian friends and joy the nations whom thy arm defends as i shall glad each chief and trojan wife who wearies heaven with vows for hectors life but let us on this memorable day exchange some gift that greece and troy may say not hate but glory made these chiefs contend and each brave foe was in his soul a friend with that a sword with stars of silver graced the baldric studded and the sheath enchased he gave the greek the generous greek bestowd a radiant belt that rich with purple glowd then with majestic grace they quit the plain this seeks the grecian that the phrygian train the trojan bands returning hector wait and hail with joy the champion of their state escaped great ajax they survey him round alive unarmd and vigorous from his wound to troys high gates the godlike man they bear their present triumph as their late despair but ajax glorying in his hardy deed the wellarmd greeks to agamemnon lead a steer for sacrifice the king designd of full five years and of the nobler kind the victim falls they strip the smoking hide the beast they quarter and the joints divide then spread the tables the repast prepare each takes his seat and each receives his share the king himself an honorary sign before great ajax placed the mighty chine when now the rage of hunger was removed nestor in each persuasive art approved the sage whose counsels long had swayd the rest in words like these his prudent thought expressd how dear o kings this fatal day has cost what greeks are perishd what a people lost what tides of blood have drenchd scamanders shore what crowds of heroes sunk to rise no more then hear me chief nor let the morrows light awake thy squadrons to new toils of fight some space at least permit the war to breathe while we to flames our slaughterd friends bequeath from the red field their scatterd bodies bear and nigh the fleet a funeral structure rear so decent urns their snowy bones may keep and pious children oer their ashes weep here where on one promiscuous pile they blazed high oer them all a general tomb be raised next to secure our camp and naval powers raise an embattled wall with lofty towers from space to space be ample gates around for passing chariots and a trench profound so greece to combat shall in safety go nor fear the fierce incursions of the foe twas thus the sage his wholesome counsel moved the sceptred kings of greece his words approved meanwhile convened at priams palacegate the trojan peers in nightly council sate a senate void of order as of choice their hearts were fearful and confused their voice antenor rising thus demands their ear ye trojans dardans and auxiliars hear tis heaven the counsel of my breast inspires and i but move what every god requires let spartas treasures be this hour restored and argive helen own her ancient lord the ties of faith the sworn alliance broke our impious battles the just gods provoke as this advice ye practise or reject so hope success or dread the dire effect the senior spoke and sate to whom replied the graceful husband of the spartan bride cold counsels trojan may become thy years but sound ungrateful in a warriors ears old man if void of fallacy or art thy words express the purpose of thy heart thou in thy time more sound advice hast given but wisdom has its date assignd by heaven then hear me princes of the trojan name their treasures ill restore but not the dame my treasures too for peace i will resign but be this bright possession ever mine twas then the growing discord to compose slow from his seat the reverend priam rose his godlike aspect deep attention drew he paused and these pacific words ensue ye trojans dardans and auxiliar bands now take refreshment as the hour demands guard well the walls relieve the watch of night till the new sun restores the cheerful light then shall our herald to the atrides sent before their ships proclaim my sons intent next let a truce be askd that troy may burn her slaughterd heroes and their bones inurn that done once more the fate of war be tried and whose the conquest mighty jove decide the monarch spoke the warriors snatchd with haste each at his post in arms a short repast soon as the rosy morn had waked the day to the black ships idus bent his way there to the sons of mars in council found he raised his voice the host stood listening round ye sons of atreus and ye greeks give ear the words of troy and troys great monarch hear pleased may ye hear so heaven succeed my prayers what paris author of the war declares the spoils and treasures he to ilion bore oh had he perishd ere they touchd our shore he proffers injured greece with large increase of

bones inurn that done once more the fate of war be tried and whose the conquest mighty jove decide the greeks gave ear but none the silence broke at length tydides rose and rising spoke oh take not friends defrauded of your fame their profferd wealth nor even the spartan dame let conquest make them ours fate shakes their wall and troy already totters to her fall the admiring chiefs and all the

heroes corps i war not with the dead go search your slaughtered chiefs on yonder plain and gratify the manes of the slain be witness jove whose thunder rolls on high he said and reard his sceptre to the sky to sacred troy where all her princes lay to wait the event the herald bent his way he came and standing in the midst explaind the peace rejected but the truce obtaind straight to their several

reddening light the doubtful confines of the day and night about the dying flames the greeks appeard and round the pile a general tomb they reard then to secure the camp and naval powers they raised embattled walls with lofty towers from space to space were ample gates around for passing chariots and a trench profound of large extent and deep in earth below strong piles infixd stood adverse to

hector with grief his charioteer beheld all pale and breathless on the sanguine field then bids cebriones direct the rein quits his bright car and issues on the plain dreadful he shouts from earth a stone he took and rushd on teucer with the lifted rock the youth already straind the forceful yew the shaft already to his shoulder drew the feather in his hand just wingd for flight touchd where the neck and hollow chest unite there where the juncture knits the channel bone the furious chief discharged the craggy stone the bowstring burst beneath the ponderous blow and his numbd hand dismissd his

force of fate and drain the dregs of heavens relentless hate gods shall one raging hand thus level all what numbers fell what numbers yet shall fall what power divine shall hectors wrath assuage still swells the slaughter and still grows the rage so spake the imperial regent of the skies to whom the goddess with the azure eyes long since had hector staind these fields with gore stretchd by some argive on his native shore but he above the sire of heaven withstands mocks our attempts and slights our just demands the stubborn god inflexible and hard forgets my service and deserved reward saved

dire event when to grim plutos gloomy gates he went the triple dog had never felt his chain nor styx been crossd nor hell explored in vain averse to me of all his heaven of gods at thetis suit the partial thunderer nods to grace her gloomy fierce resenting son my hopes are frustrate and my greeks undone some future day perhaps he may be moved to call his blueeyed maid his best beloved haste launch thy chariot through yon ranks to ride myself will arm and thunder at thy side then goddess say shall hector glory then that terror of the greeks that man of men when junos self and pallas shall

nor shall great hector cease the rage of fight the navy flaming and thy greeks in flight even till the day when certain fates ordain that stern achilles his patroclus slain shall rise in vengeance and lay waste the plain for such is fate nor canst thou turn its course with all thy rage with all thy rebel force fly if thy wilt to earths remotest bound where on her utmost verge the seas resound where cursed iapetus and saturn dwell fast by the brink within the streams of hell no sun eer gilds the gloomy horrors there no cheerful gales refresh the lazy air there arm once more the bold titanian band

obey the night and use her peaceful hours our steeds to forage and refresh our powers straight from the town be sheep and oxen sought and strengthening bread and generous wine be brought wide oer the

night greece on her sable ships attempt her flight not unmolested let the wretches gain their lofty decks or safely cleave the main some hostile wound let every dart bestow some lasting token of the phrygian foe wounds that long hence may ask their spouses care and warn their children from a trojan war now through the circuit of our ilion wall let sacred heralds sound the solemn call to bid the

foes to free the land who ploughd with fates averse the watery way for trojan vultures a predestined prey our common safety must be now the care but soon as morning paints the fields of air sheathed in bright arms let every troop engage and the fired fleet behold the battle rage then then shall hector and tydides prove whose fates are heaviest in the scales of jove tomorrows light o haste the glorious morn shall see his bloody spoils in triumph borne with this keen javelin shall his breast be gored and prostrate heroes bleed around their lord certain as this oh might my days endure from

peers but bid in whispers these surround their chief in solemn sadness and majestic grief the king amidst the mournful circle rose down his wan cheek a briny torrent flows so silent fountains from a rocks tall head in sable streams softtrickling waters shed with more than vulgar grief he stood oppressd words mixd with sighs thus bursting from his breast ye sons of greece partake your leaders care fellows in arms and princes of the war of partial jove too justly we complain and heavenly oracles believed in vain a safe return was promised to our toils with conquest honourd and enrichd with spoils now shameful flight alone can save the host our wealth our people and our glory lost so jove decrees almighty lord of all jove at whose nod whole empires rise or fall who shakes the feeble props of human trust and towers and armies humbles to the dust haste then for ever quit these fatal fields haste to the joys our native country yields spread all your canvas all your oars employ nor hope the fall of heavendefended troy he said deep silence held the grecian band silent unmovd in dire dismay they stand a pensive scene till tydeus warlike son rolld on the king his eyes and thus begun when kings advise us to renounce our fame first let him speak who first has sufferd shame if i oppose thee prince thy wrath withhold the laws of council bid my tongue be bold thou first and thou alone in fields of fight durst brand my courage and defame my might nor from a friend the unkind reproach appeard the greeks stood witness all our army heard the gods o chief from whom our honours spring the gods have made thee but by halves a king they gave thee sceptres and a wide command they gave dominion oer the seas and land the noblest power that might the world control they gave thee nota brave and virtuous soul is this a generals voice that would suggest fears like his own to every grecian breast confiding in our want of worth he stands and if we fly tis what our king commands go thou inglorious from the embattled plain ships thou hast store and nearest to the main a noble care the grecians shall employ to combat conquer and extirpate troy here greece shall stay or if all greece retire myself shall stay till troy or i expire myself and sthenelus will fight for fame god bade us fight and twas with god we came he ceased the greeks loud acclamations raise and voice to voice resounds tydides praise wise nestor then his reverend figure reard he spoke the host in still attention heard o truly great in whom the gods have joind such strength of body with such force of mind in conduct as in courage you excel still first to act what you advise so well these wholesome counsels which thy wisdom moves applauding greece with common voice approves kings thou canst blame a bold but prudent youth and blame even kings with praise because with truth and yet those years that since thy birth have run would hardly style thee nestors youngest son then let me add what yet remains behind a thought unfinishd in that generous mind age bids me speak nor shall the advice i bring distaste the people or offend the king cursed is the man and void of law and right unworthy

silence and with purest hands illustration the embassy to achilles he said and all approved the heralds bring the cleansing water from the living spring the youth with wine the sacred goblets crownd and large libations drenchd the sands around the rite performd the chiefs their thirst allay then from the royal tent they take their way wise nestor turns on each his careful eye forbids to offend instructs them to apply much he advised them all ulysses most to deprecate the chief and save the host through the still night they march and hear the roar of murmuring billows on the sounding shore to neptune ruler of the seas profound whose liquid arms the mighty globe surround they pour forth vows their embassy to bless and calm the rage of stern acides and now arrived where on the sandy bay the myrmidonian tents and vessels lay amused at ease the godlike man they found pleased with the solemn harps harmonious sound the well wrought harp from conquered thebae came of polishd silver was

three chines entire the brazen vase automedon sustains which flesh of porker sheep and goat contains achilles at the genial feast presides the parts transfixes and with skill divides meanwhile patroclus sweats the fire to raise the tent is brightend with the rising blaze then when the languid flames at length subside he strows a bed of glowing embers wide above the coals the smoking fragments turns and sprinkles sacred salt from lifted urns with bread the glittering canisters they load which round the board menoetius son bestowd himself opposed to ulysses full in sight each

that done to phnix ajax gave the sign not unperceived ulysses crownd with wine the foaming bowl and instant thus began his speech addressing to the godlike man health to achilles happy are thy guests not those more honourd whom atrides feasts though generous plenty crown thy loaded boards that agamemnons regal tent affords but greater cares sit heavy on our souls nor eased by banquets or by flowing bowls what scenes of slaughter in yon fields appear the dead we mourn and for the living fear greece on the brink of fate all doubtful stands and owns no help but from thy saving hands troy and her aids for ready vengeance call their threatening tents already shade our wall hear how with shouts their conquest they proclaim and point at every ship their vengeful flame for them the father

thy cares engage to calm thy passions and subdue thy rage from gentler manners let thy glory grow and shun contention the sure source of woe that young and old may in thy praise combine the virtues of humanity be thine this nowdespised advice thy father gave ah check thy anger and be truly brave if thou wilt yield to great atrides prayers gifts worthy thee his royal hand prepares if notbut hear me while i number oer the profferd presents an exhaustless store ten weighty talents of the purest gold and twice ten vases of refulgent mould seven sacred tripods whose unsullied frame yet knows no

proffers which this day we bring such the repentance of a suppliant king but if all this relentless thou disdain if honour and if interest plead in vain yet some redress to suppliant greece afford and be amongst her guardian gods adored if no regard thy suffering country claim hear thy own glory and the voice of fame for now that chief whose unresisted ire made nations tremble and whole hosts retire proud hector now the unequal fight demands and only triumphs to deserve thy hands then thus the goddessborn ulysses hear a faithful speech that knows nor art nor fear what in my secret soul is understood my tongue shall utter and my deeds make good let greece then know my purpose i retain nor with new treaties vex my peace in vain who dares think one thing and another tell my heart detests him as the gates of hell then thus in short my fixd resolves attend which nor atrides nor his greeks can bend long toils long perils in their cause i bore but now the unfruitful glories charm no more fight or not fight a like reward we claim the wretch and hero find their prize the same alike regretted in the dust he lies who yields ignobly or who bravely dies of all my dangers all my glorious pains a life of labours lo what fruit remains as the bold bird her helpless young attends from danger guards them and from want defends in search of prey she wings the spacious air and with the untasted food supplies her care for thankless greece such hardships have i braved her wives her infants by my labours saved long sleepless nights in heavy arms i stood and sweat laborious days in dust and blood i sackd twelve ample cities on the main and twelve lay smoking on the trojan plain then at atrides haughty feet were laid the wealth i gathered and the spoils i made your mighty monarch these in peace possessd some few my soldiers had himself the rest some present too to every prince was paid and every prince enjoys the gift he made i only must refund of all his train see what preeminence our merits gain my spoil alone his greedy soul delights my spouse alone must bless his lustful nights the woman let him as he may enjoy but whats the quarrel then of greece to troy what to these shores the assembled nations draws what calls for vengeance but a womans cause are fair endowments and a beauteous face beloved by none but those of atreus race the wife whom choice and passion doth approve sure every wise and worthy man will love nor did my fair one less distinction claim slave as she was my soul adored the dame wrongd in my love all proffers i disdain deceived for once i trust not kings again ye have my answerwhat remains to do your king ulysses may consult with you what needs he the defence this arm can make has he not walls no human force can shake has he not fenced his guarded navy round with piles with ramparts and a trench profound and will not these the wonders he has done repel the rage of priams single son there was a time twas when for greece i fought when hectors prowess no such wonders wrought he kept the verge of troy nor dared to wait achilles fury at the scan gate he tried it once and scarce was saved by fate but now those ancient enmities are oer tomorrow we the favouring gods implore then shall you see our parting vessels crownd and hear with oars the hellespont resound the third day hence shall pythia greet our sails if mighty neptune send propitious gales pythia to her achilles shall restore the wealth he left for this detested shore thither the spoils of this long war shall pass the ruddy gold the steel and shining brass my beauteous captives thither ill convey and all that rests of my unravishd prey one only valued gift your tyrant gave and that resumedthe fair lyrnessian slave then tell him loud that all the greeks may hear and learn to scorn the wretch they basely fear for armd in impudence mankind he braves and meditates new cheats on all his slaves though shameless as he is to face these eyes is what he dares not if he dares he dies tell him all terms all commerce i decline nor share his council nor his battle join for once deceivd was his but twice were mine nolet the stupid prince whom jove deprives of sense and justice run where frenzy drives his gifts are hateful kings of such a kind stand but as slaves before a noble mind not though he profferd all himself possessd and all his rapine could from others wrest not all the golden tides of wealth that crown the manypeopled orchomenian town not all proud thebes unrivalld walls contain the worlds great empress on the egyptian plain that spreads her conquests oer a thousand states and pours her heroes through a hundred gates two hundred horsemen and two hundred cars from each wide portal issuing to the wars though bribes were heapd on bribes in number more than dust in fields or sands along the shore should all these offers for my friendship call tis he that offers and i scorn them all atrides daughter never shall be led an illmatchd consort to achilles bed like golden venus though she charmd the heart and vied with pallas in the works of art some greater greek let those high nuptials grace i hate alliance with a tyrants race if heaven restore me to my realms with life the reverend peleus shall elect my wife thessalian nymphs there are of form divine and kings that sue to mix their blood with mine blessd in kind love my years shall glide away content with just hereditary sway there deaf for ever to the martial strife enjoy the dear prerogative of life life is not to be bought with heaps of gold not all apollos pythian treasures hold or troy once held in peace and pride of sway can bribe the poor possession of a day lost herds and treasures we by arms regain and steeds unrivalld on the dusty plain but from our lips the vital spirit fled returns no more to wake the silent dead my fates long since by thetis were disclosed and each alternate life or fame proposed here if i stay before the trojan town short is my date but deathless my renown if i return i quit immortal praise for years on years and longextended days convinced though late i find my fond mistake and warn the greeks the wiser choice to make to quit these shores their native seats enjoy nor hope the fall of heavendefended troy joves arm displayd asserts her from the skies her hearts are strengthend and her glories rise go then to greece report our fixd design bid all your counsels all your armies join let all your forces all your arts conspire to save the ships the troops the chiefs from fire one stratagem has faild and others will ye find achilles is unconquerd still go thendigest my message as ye may but here this night let reverend phnix stay his tedious toils and hoary hairs demand a peaceful death in pythias friendly land but whether he remain or sail with me his age be sacred and his will be free illustration greek galley the son of peleus ceased the chiefs around in silence wrapt in consternation drownd attend the stern reply then phnix rose down his white beard a stream of sorrow flows and while the fate of suffering greece he mournd with accent weak these tender words returnd illustration proserpine divine achilles wilt thou then retire and leave our hosts in blood our fleets on fire if wrath so dreadful fill thy ruthless mind how shall thy friend thy phnix stay behind the royal peleus when from pythias coast he sent thee early to the achaian host thy youth as then in sage debates unskilld and new to perils of the direful field he bade me teach thee all the ways of war to shine in councils and in camps to dare never ah never let me leave thy side no time shall part us and no fate divide not though the god that breathed my life restore the bloom i boasted and the port i bore when greece of old beheld my youthful flames delightful greece the land of lovely dames my father faithless to my mothers arms old as he was adored a strangers charms i tried what youth could do at her desire to win the damsel and prevent my sire my sire with curses loads my hated head and cries ye furies barren be his bed infernal jove the vengeful fiends below and ruthless proserpine confirmd his vow despair and grief distract my labouring mind gods what a crime my impious heart designd i thought but some kind god that thought suppressd to plunge the poniard in my fathers breast then meditate my flight my friends in vain with prayers entreat me and with force detain on fat of rams black bulls and brawny swine they daily feast with draughts of fragrant wine strong guards they placed and watchd nine nights entire the roofs and porches flamed with constant fire the tenth i forced the gates unseen of all and favourd by the night oerleapd the wall my travels thence through spacious greece extend in phthias court at last my labours end your sire received me as his son caressd with gifts enrichd and with possessions blessd the strong dolopians thenceforth ownd my reign and all the coast that runs along the main by love to thee his bounties i repaid and early wisdom to thy soul conveyd great as thou art my lessons made thee brave a child i took thee but a hero gave thy infant breast a like affection showd still in my arms an everpleasing load or at my knee by phnix wouldst thou stand no food was grateful but from phnix hand i pass my watchings oer thy helpless years the tender labours the compliant cares the gods i thought reversed their hard decree and phnix felt a fathers joys in thee thy growing virtues justified my cares and promised comfort to my silver hairs now be thy rage thy fatal rage resignd a cruel heart ill suits a manly mind the gods the only great and only wise are moved by offerings vows and sacrifice offending man their high compassion wins and daily prayers atone for daily sins prayers are joves daughters of celestial race lame are their feet and wrinkled is their face with humble mien and with dejected eyes constant they follow where injustice flies injustice swift erect and unconfined sweeps the wide earth and tramples oer mankind while prayers to heal her wrongs move slow behind who hears these daughters of almighty jove for him they mediate to the throne above when man rejects the humble suit they make the sire revenges for the daughters sake from jove commissiond fierce injustice then descends to punish unrelenting men o let not headlong passion bear the sway these reconciling goddesses obey due honours to the seed of jove belong due honours calm the fierce and bend the strong were these not paid thee by the terms we bring were rage still harbourd in the haughty king nor greece nor all her fortunes should engage thy friend to plead against so just a rage but since what honour asks the general sends and sends by those whom most thy heart commends the best and noblest of the grecian train permit not these to sue and sue in vain let me my son an ancient fact unfold a great example drawn from times of old hear what our fathers were and what their praise who conquerd their revenge in former days where calydon on rocky mountains stands once fought the tolian and curetian bands to guard it those to conquer these advance and mutual deaths were dealt with mutual chance the silver cynthia bade contention rise in vengeance of neglected sacrifice on neus fields she sent a monstrous boar that levelld harvests and whole forests tore this beast when many a chief his tusks had slain great meleager stretchd along the plain then for his spoils a new debate arose the neighbour nations thence commencing foes strong as they were the bold curetes faild while meleagers thundering arm prevaild till rage at length inflamed his lofty breast for rage invades the wisest and the best cursed by althaea to his wrath he yields and in his wifes embrace forgets the fields she from marpessa sprung divinely fair and matchless idas more than man in war the god of day adored the mothers charms against the god the father bent his arms the afflicted pair their sorrows to proclaim from cleopatra changed their daughters name and calld alcyone a name to show the fathers grief the mourning mothers woe to her the chief retired from stern debate but found no peace from fierce althaeas hate althaeas hate the unhappy warrior drew whose luckless hand his royal uncle slew she beat the ground and calld the powers beneath on her own son to wreak her brothers death hell heard her curses from the realms profound and the red fiends that walk the nightly round in vain tolia her deliverer waits war shakes her walls and thunders at her gates she sent ambassadors a chosen band priests of the gods and elders of the land besought the chief to save the sinking state their prayers were urgent and their proffers great full fifty acres of the richest ground half pasture green and half with vineyards crownd his suppliant father aged neus came his sisters followd even the vengeful dame althaea sues his friends before him fall he stands relentless and rejects them all meanwhile the victors shouts ascend the skies the walls are scaled the rolling flames arise at length his wife a form divine appears with piercing cries and supplicating tears she paints the horrors of a conquerd town the heroes slain the palaces oerthrown the matrons ravishd the whole race enslaved the warrior heard he vanquishd and he saved the tolians long disdaind now took their turn and left the chief their broken faith to mourn learn hence betimes to curb pernicious ire nor stay till yonder fleets ascend in fire accept the presents draw thy conquering sword and be amongst our guardian gods adored thus he the stern achilles thus replied my second father and my reverend guide thy friend believe me no such gifts demands and asks no honours from a mortals hands jove honours me and favours my designs his pleasure guides me and his will confines and here i stay if such his high behest while lifes warm spirit beats within my breast yet hear one word and lodge it in thy heart no more molest me on atrides part is it for him these tears are taught to flow for him these sorrows for my mortal foe a generous friendship no cold medium knows burns with one love with one resentment glows one should our interests and our passions be my friend must hate the man that injures me do this my phnix tis a generous part and share my realms my honours and my heart let these return our voyage or our stay rest undetermined till the dawning day he ceased then orderd for the sages bed a warmer couch with numerous carpets spread with that stern ajax his long silence broke and thus impatient to ulysses spoke hence let us gowhy waste we time in vain see what effect our low submissions gain liked or not liked his words we must relate the greeks expect them and our heroes wait proud as he is that iron heart retains its stubborn purpose and his friends disdains stern and unpitying if a brother bleed on just atonement we remit the deed a sire the slaughter of his son forgives the price of blood discharged the murderer lives the haughtiest hearts at length their rage resign and gifts can conquer every soul but thine the gods that unrelenting breast have steeld and cursed thee with a mind that cannot yield one womanslave was ravishd from thy arms lo seven are offerd and of equal charms then hear achilles be of better mind revere thy roof and to thy guests be kind and know the men of all the grecian host who honour worth and prize thy valour most o soul of battles and thy peoples guide to ajax thus the first of greeks replied well hast thou spoke but at the tyrants name my rage rekindles and my souls on flame tis just resentment and becomes the brave disgraced dishonourd like the vilest slave return then heroes and our answer bear the glorious combat is no more my care not till amidst yon sinking navy slain the blood of greeks shall dye the sable main not till the flames by hectors fury thrown consume your vessels and approach my own just there the impetuous homicide shall stand there cease his battle and there feel our hand this said each prince a double goblet crownd and cast a large libation on the ground then to their vessels through the gloomy shades the chiefs return divine ulysses leads meantime achilles slaves prepared a bed with fleeces carpets and soft linen spread there till the sacred morn restored the day in slumber sweet the reverend phnix lay but in his inner tent an ampler space achilles slept and in his warm embrace fair diomede of the lesbian race last for patroclus was the couch prepared whose nightly joys the beauteous iphis shared achilles to his friend consignd her charms when scyros fell before his conquering arms and now the elected chiefs whom greece had sent passd through the hosts and reachd the royal tent then rising all with goblets in their hands the peers and leaders of the achaian bands haild their return atrides first begun say what success divine laertes son achilles high resolves declare to all returns the chief or must our navy fall great king of nations ithacus replied fixd is his wrath unconquerd is his pride he slights thy friendship thy proposals scorns and thus implored with fiercer fury burns to save our army and our fleets to free is not his care but left to greece and thee your eyes shall view when morning paints the sky beneath his oars the whitening billows fly us too he bids our oars and sails employ nor hope the fall of heavenprotected troy for jove oershades her with his arm divine inspires her war and bids her glory shine such was his word what further he declared these sacred heralds and great ajax heard but phnix in his tent the chief retains safe to transport him to his native plains when morning dawns if other he decree his age is sacred and his choice is free ulysses ceased the great achaian host with sorrow seized in consternation lost attend the stern reply tydides broke the general silence and undaunted spoke why should we gifts to proud achilles send or strive with prayers his haughty soul to bend his countrys woes he glories to deride and prayers will burst that swelling heart with pride be the fierce impulse of his rage obeyd our battles let him or desert or aid then let him arm when jove or he think fit that to his madness or to heaven commit what for ourselves we can is always ours this night let due repast refresh our powers for strength consists in spirits and in blood and those are owed to generous wine and food but when the rosy messenger of day strikes the blue mountains with her golden ray ranged at the ships let all our squadrons shine in flaming arms a longextended line in the dread front let great atrides stand the first in danger as in high command shouts of acclaim the listening heroes raise then each to heaven the due libations pays till sleep descending oer the tents bestows the grateful blessings of desired repose illustration achilles book x argument the nightadventure of diomed and ulysses upon the refusal of achilles to return to the army the distress of agamemnon is described in the most lively manner he takes no rest that night but passes through the camp awaking the leaders and contriving all possible methods for the public safety menelaus nestor ulysses and diomed are employed in raising the rest of the captains they call a council of war and determine to send scouts into the enemies camp to learn their posture and discover their intentions diomed undertakes this hazardous enterprise and makes choice of ulysses for his companion in their passage they surprise dolon whom hector had sent on a like design to the camp of the grecians from him they are informed of the situation of the trojan and auxiliary forces and particularly of rhesus and the thracians who were lately arrived they pass on with success kill rhesus with several of his officers and seize the famous horses of that prince with which they return in triumph to the camp the same night continues the scene lies in the two camps all night the chiefs before their vessels lay and lost in sleep the labours of the day all but the king with various thoughts oppressd his countrys cares lay rolling in his breast as when by lightnings joves ethereal power foretels the rattling hail or weighty shower or sends soft snows to whiten all the shore or bids the brazen throat of war to roar by fits one flash succeeds as one expires and heaven flames thick with momentary fires so bursting frequent from atrides breast sighs following sighs his inward fears confessd now oer the fields dejected he surveys from thousand trojan fires the mounting blaze hears in the passing wind their music blow and marks distinct the voices of the foe now looking backwards to the fleet and coast anxious he sorrows for the endangered host he rends his hair in sacrifice to jove and sues to him that ever lives above inly he groans while glory and despair divide his heart and wage a double war a thousand cares his labouring breast revolves to seek sage nestor now the chief resolves with him in wholesome counsels to debate what yet remains to save the afflicted state he rose and first he cast his mantle round next on his feet the shining sandals bound a lions yellow spoils his back conceald his warlike hand a pointed javelin held meanwhile his brother pressd with equal woes alike denied the gifts of soft repose laments for greece that in his cause before so much had sufferd and must suffer more a leopards spotted hide his shoulders spread a brazen helmet glitterd on his head thus with a javelin in his hand he went to wake atrides in the royal tent already waked atrides he descried his armour buckling at his vessels side joyful they met the spartan thus begun why puts my brother his bright armour on sends he some spy amidst these silent hours to try yon camp and watch the trojan powers but say what hero shall sustain that task such bold exploits uncommon courage ask guideless alone through nights dark shade to go and midst a hostile camp explore the foe to whom the king in such distress we stand no vulgar counsel our affairs demand greece to preserve is now no easy part but asks high wisdom deep design and art for jove averse our humble prayer denies and bows his head to hectors sacrifice what eye has witnessd or what ear believed in one great day by one great arm achieved such wondrous deeds as hectors hand has done and we beheld the last revolving sun what honours the beloved of jove adorn sprung from no god and of no goddess born yet such his acts as greeks unborn shall tell and curse the battle where their fathers fell now speed thy hasty course along the fleet there call great ajax and the prince of crete ourself to hoary nestor will repair to keep the guards on duty be his care for nestors influence best that quarter guides whose son with merion oer the watch presides to whom the spartan these thy orders borne say shall i stay or with despatch return there shall thou stay the king of men replied else may we miss to meet without a guide the paths so many and the camp so wide still with your voice the slothful soldiers raise urge by their fathers fame their future praise forget we now our state and lofty birth not titles here but works must prove our worth to labour is the lot of man below and when jove gave us life he gave us woe this said each parted to his several cares the king to nestors sable ship repairs the sage protector of the greeks he found stretchd in his bed with all his arms around the variouscolourd scarf the shield he rears the shining helmet and the pointed spears the dreadful weapons of the warriors rage that old in arms disdaind the peace of age then leaning on his hand his watchful head the hoary monarch raised his eyes and said what art thou speak that on designs unknown while others sleep thus range the camp alone seekst thou some friend or nightly sentinel stand off approach not but thy purpose tell o son of neleus thus the king rejoind pride of the greeks and glory of thy kind lo here the wretched agamemnon stands the unhappy general of the grecian bands whom jove decrees with daily cares to bend and woes that only with his life shall end scarce can my knees these trembling limbs sustain and scarce my heart support its load of pain no taste of sleep these heavy eyes have known confused and sad i wander thus alone with fears distracted with no fixd design and all my peoples miseries are mine if aught of use thy waking thoughts suggest since cares like mine deprive thy soul of rest impart thy counsel and assist thy friend now let us jointly to the trench descend at every gate the fainting guard excite tired with the toils of day and watch of night else may the sudden foe our works invade so near and favourd by the gloomy shade to him thus nestor trust the powers above nor think proud hectors hopes confirmd by jove how ill agree the views of vain mankind and the wise counsels of the eternal mind audacious hector if the gods ordain that great achilles rise and rage again what toils attend thee and what woes remain lo faithful nestor thy command obeys the care is next our other chiefs to raise ulysses diomed we chiefly need meges for strength oleus famed for speed some other be despatchd of nimbler feet to those tall ships remotest of the fleet where lie great ajax and the king of crete to rouse the spartan i myself decree dear as he is to us and dear to thee yet must i tax his sloth that claims no share with his great brother in his martial care him it behoved to every chief to sue preventing every part performd by you for strong necessity our toils demands claims all our hearts and urges all our hands to whom the king with reverence we allow thy just rebukes yet learn to spare them now my generous brother is of gentle kind he seems remiss but bears a valiant mind through too much deference to our sovereign sway content to follow when we lead the way but now our ills industrious to prevent long ere the rest he rose and sought my tent the chiefs you named already at his call prepare to meet us near the navywall assembling there between the trench and gates near the nightguards our chosen council waits then none said nestor shall his rule withstand for great examples justify command with that the venerable warrior rose the shining greaves his manly legs enclose his purple mantle golden buckles joind warm with the softest wool and doubly lined then rushing from his tent he snatchd in haste his steely lance that lightend as he passd the camp he traversed through the sleeping crowd stoppd at ulysses tent and calld aloud ulysses sudden as the voice was sent awakes starts up and issues from his tent what new distress what sudden cause of fright thus leads you wandering in the silent night o prudent chief the pylian sage replied wise as thou art be now thy wisdom tried whatever means of safety can be sought whatever counsels can inspire our thought whatever methods or to fly or fight all all depend on this important night he heard returnd and took his painted shield then joind the chiefs and followd through the field without his tent bold diomed they found all sheathed in arms his brave companions round each sunk in sleep extended on the field his head reclining on his bossy shield a wood of spears stood by that fixd upright shot from their flashing points a quivering light a bulls black hide composed the heros bed a splendid carpet rolld beneath his head then with his foot old nestor gently shakes the slumbering chief and in these words awakes rise son of tydeus to the brave and strong rest seems inglorious and the night too long but sleepst thou now when from yon hill the foe hangs oer the fleet and shades our walls below at this soft slumber from his eyelids fled the warrior saw the hoary chief and said wondrous old man whose soul no respite knows though years and honours bid thee seek repose let younger greeks our sleeping warriors wake ill fits thy age these toils to undertake my friend he answered generous is thy care these toils my subjects and my sons might bear their loyal thoughts and pious love conspire to ease a sovereign and relieve a sire but now the last despair surrounds our host no hour must pass no moment must be lost each single greek in this conclusive strife stands on the sharpest edge of death or life yet if my years thy kind regard engage employ thy youth as i employ my age succeed to these my cares and rouse the rest he serves me most who serves his country best this said the hero oer his shoulders flung a lions spoils that to his ankles hung then seized his ponderous lance and strode along meges the bold with ajax famed for speed the warrior roused and to the entrenchments lead and now the chiefs approach the nightly guard a wakeful squadron each in arms prepared the unwearied watch their listening leaders keep and couching close repel invading sleep so faithful dogs their fleecy charge maintain with toil protected from the prowling train when the gaunt lioness with hunger bold springs from the mountains toward the guarded fold through breaking woods her rustling course they hear loud and more loud the clamours strike their ear of hounds and men they start they gaze around watch every side and turn to every sound thus watchd the grecians cautious of surprise each voice each motion drew their ears and eyes each step of passing feet increased the affright and hostile troy was ever full in sight nestor with joy the wakeful band surveyd and thus accosted through the gloomy shade tis well my sons your nightly cares employ else must our host become the scorn of troy watch thus and greece shall live the hero said then oer the trench the following chieftains led his son and godlike merion marchd behind for these the princes to their council joind the trenches passd the assembled kings around in silent state the consistory crownd a place there was yet undefiled with gore the spot where hector stoppd his rage before when night descending from his vengeful hand reprieved the relics of the grecian band the plain beside with mangled corps was spread and all his progress markd by heaps of dead there sat the mournful kings when neleus son the council opening in these words begun is there said he a chief so greatly brave his life to hazard and his country save lives there a man who singly dares to go to yonder camp or seize some straggling foe or favourd by the night approach so near their speech their counsels and designs to hear if to besiege our navies they prepare or troy once more must be the seat of war this could he learn and to our peers recite and pass unharmd the dangers of the night what fame were his through all succeeding days while phbus shines or men have tongues to praise what gifts his grateful country would bestow what must not greece to her deliverer owe a sable ewe each leader should provide with each a sable lambkin by her side at every rite his share should be increased and his the foremost honours of the feast fear held them mute alone untaught to fear tydides spokethe man you seek is here through yon black camps to bend my dangerous way some god within commands and i obey but let some other chosen warrior join to raise my hopes and second my design by mutual confidence and mutual aid great deeds are done and great discoveries made the wise new prudence from the wise acquire and one brave hero fans anothers fire contending leaders at the word arose each generous breast with emulation glows so brave a task each ajax strove to share bold merion strove and nestors valiant heir the spartan wishd the second place to gain and great ulysses wishd nor wishd in vain then thus the king of men the contest ends thou first of warriors and thou best of friends undaunted diomed what chief to join in this great enterprise is only thine just be thy choice without affection made to birth or office no respect be paid let worth determine here the monarch spake and inly trembled for his brothers sake then thus the godlike diomed rejoind my choice declares the impulse of my mind how can i doubt while great ulysses stands to lend his counsels and assist our hands a chief whose safety is minervas care so famed so dreadful in the works of war blessd in his conduct i no aid require wisdom like his might pass through flames of fire it fits thee not before these chiefs of fame replied the sage to praise me or to blame praise from a friend or censure from a foe are lost on hearers that our merits know but let us hastenight rolls the hours away the reddening orient shows the coming day the stars shine fainter on the ethereal plains and of nights empire but a third remains thus having spoke with generous ardour pressd in arms terrific their huge limbs they dressd a twoedged falchion thrasymed the brave and ample buckler to tydides gave then in a leathern helm he cased his head short of its crest and with no plume oerspread such as by youths unused to arms are worn no spoils enrich it and no studs adorn next him ulysses took a shining sword a bow and quiver with bright arrows stored a wellproved casque with leather braces bound thy gift meriones his temples crownd soft wool within without in order spread a boars white teeth grinnd horrid oer his head this from amyntor rich ormenus son autolycus by fraudful rapine won and gave amphidamas from him the prize molus received the pledge of social ties the helmet next by merion was possessd and now ulysses thoughtful temples pressd thus sheathed in arms the council they forsake and dark through paths oblique their progress take just then in sign she favourd their intent a longwingd heron great minerva sent this though surrounding shades obscured their view by the shrill clang and whistling wings they knew as from the right she soard ulysses prayd haild the glad omen and addressd the maid o daughter of that god whose arm can wield the avenging bolt and shake the saber shield o thou for ever present in my way who all my motions all my toils survey safe may we pass beneath the gloomy shade safe by thy succour to our ships conveyd and let some deed this signal night adorn to claim the tears of trojans yet unborn then godlike diomed preferrd his prayer daughter of jove unconquerd pallas hear great queen of arms whose favour tydeus won as thou defendst the sire defend the son when on sopus banks the banded powers of greece he left and sought the theban towers peace was his charge received with peaceful show he went a legate but returnd a foe then helpd by thee and coverd by thy shield he fought with numbers and made numbers yield so now be present o celestial maid so still continue to the race thine aid a youthful steer shall fall beneath the stroke untamed unconscious of the galling yoke with ample forehead and with spreading horns whose taper tops refulgent gold adorns the heroes prayd and pallas from the skies accords their vow succeeds their enterprise now like two lions panting for the prey with dreadful thoughts they trace the dreary way through the black horrors of the ensanguined plain through dust through blood oer arms and hills of slain nor less bold hector and the sons of troy on high designs the wakeful hours employ the assembled peers their lofty chief enclosed who thus the counsels of his breast proposed what glorious man for high attempts prepared dares greatly venture for a rich reward of yonder fleet a bold discovery make what watch they keep and what resolves they take if now subdued they meditate their flight and spent with toil neglect the watch of night his be the chariot that shall please him most of all the plunder of the vanquishd host his the fair steeds that all the rest excel and his the glory to have served so well a youth there was among the tribes of troy dolon his name eumedes only boy five girls beside the reverend herald told rich was the son in brass and rich in gold not blessd by nature with the charms of face but swift of foot and matchless in the race hector he said my courage bids me meet this high achievement and explore the fleet but first exalt thy sceptre to the skies and swear to grant me the demanded prize the immortal coursers and the glittering car that bear pelides through the ranks of war encouraged thus no idle scout i go fulfil thy wish their whole intention know even to the royal tent pursue my way and all their counsels all their aims betray the chief then heaved the golden sceptre high attesting thus the monarch of the sky be witness thou immortal lord of all whose thunder shakes the dark aerial hall by none but dolon shall this prize be borne and him alone the immortal steeds adorn thus hector swore the gods were calld in vain but the rash youth prepares to scour the plain across his back the bended bow he flung a wolfs grey hide around his shoulders hung a ferrets downy fur his helmet lined and in his hand a pointed javelin shined then never to return he sought the shore and trod the path his feet must tread no more scarce had he passd the steeds and trojan throng still bending forward as he coursed along when on the hollow way the approaching tread ulysses markd and thus to diomed o friend i hear some step of hostile feet moving this way or hastening to the fleet some spy perhaps to lurk beside the main or nightly pillager that strips the slain yet let him pass and win a little space then rush behind him and prevent his pace but if too swift of foot he flies before confine his course along the fleet and shore betwixt the camp and him our spears employ and intercept his hoped return to troy with that they steppd aside and stoopd their head as dolon passd behind a heap of dead along the path the spy unwary flew soft at just distance both the chiefs pursue so distant they and such the space between as when two teams of mules divide the green to whom the hind like shares of land allows when now new furrows part the approaching ploughs now dolon listening heard them as they passd hector he thought had sent and checkd his haste till scarce at distance of a javelins throw no voice succeeding he perceived the foe as when two skilful hounds the leveret wind or chase through woods obscure the trembling hind now lost now seen they intercept his way and from the herd still turn the flying prey so fast and with such fears the trojan flew so close so constant the bold greeks pursue now almost on the fleet the dastard falls and mingles with the guards that watch the walls when brave tydides stoppd a genrous thought inspired by pallas in his bosom wrought lest on the foe some forward greek advance and snatch the glory from his lifted lance then thus aloud whoeer thou art remain this javelin else shall fix thee to the plain he said and high in air the weapon cast which wilful errd and oer his shoulder passd then fixd in earth against the trembling wood the wretch stood proppd and quiverd as he stood a sudden palsy seized his turning head his loose teeth chatterd and his colour fled the panting warriors seize him as he stands and with unmanly tears his life demands o spare my youth and for the breath i owe large gifts of price my father shall bestow vast heaps of brass shall in your ships be told and steel welltemperd and refulgent gold to whom ulysses made this wise reply whoeer thou art be bold nor fear to die what moves thee say when sleep has closed the sight to roam the silent fields in dead of night camst thou the secrets of our camp to find by hector prompted or thy daring mind or art some wretch by hopes of plunder led through heaps of carnage to despoil the dead then thus pale dolon with a fearful look still as he spoke his limbs with horror shook hither i came by hectors words deceived much did he promise rashly i believed no less a bribe than great achilles car and those swift steeds that sweep the ranks of war urged me unwilling this attempt to make to learn what counsels what resolves you take if now subdued you fix your hopes on flight and tired with toils neglect the watch of night bold was thy aim and glorious was the prize ulysses with a scornful smile replies far other rulers those proud steeds demand and scorn the guidance of a vulgar hand even great achilles scarce their rage can tame achilles sprung from an immortal dame but say be faithful and the truth recite where lies encampd the trojan chief tonight where stand his coursers in what quarter sleep their other princes tell what watch they keep say since this conquest what their counsels are or here to combat from their city far or back to ilions walls transfer the war ulysses thus and thus eumedes son what dolon knows his faithful tongue shall own hector the peers assembling in his tent a council holds at ilus monument no certain guards the nightly watch partake whereer yon fires ascend the trojans wake anxious for troy the guard the natives keep safe in their cares the auxiliar forces sleep whose wives and infants from the danger far discharge their souls of half the fears of war then sleep those aids among the trojan train inquired the chief or scattered oer the plain to whom the spy their powers they thus dispose the paeons dreadful with their bended bows the carians caucons the pelasgian host and leleges encamp along the coast not distant far lie higher on the land the lycian mysian and monian band and phrygias horse by thymbras ancient wall the thracians utmost and apart from all these troy but lately to her succour won led on by rhesus great eioneus son i saw his coursers in proud triumph go swift as the wind and white as wintersnow rich silver plates his shining car infold his solid arms refulgent flame with gold no mortal shoulders suit the glorious load celestial panoply to grace a god let me unhappy to your fleet be borne or leave me here a captives fate to mourn in cruel chains till your return reveal the truth or falsehood of the news i tell to this tydides with a gloomy frown think not to live though all the truth be shown shall we dismiss thee in some future strife to risk more bravely thy now forfeit life or that again our camps thou mayst explore noonce a traitor thou betrayst no more sternly he spoke and as the wretch prepared with humble blandishment to stroke his beard like lightning swift the wrathful falchion flew divides the neck and cuts the nerves in two one instant snatchd his trembling soul to hell the head yet speaking mutterd as it fell the furry helmet from his brow they tear the wolfs grey hide the unbended bow and spear these great ulysses lifting to the skies to favouring pallas dedicates the prize great queen of arms receive this hostile spoil and let the thracian steeds reward our toil thee first of all the heavenly host we praise o speed our labours and direct our ways this said the spoils with dropping gore defaced high on a spreading tamarisk he placed then heapd with reeds and gathered boughs the plain to guide their footsteps to the place again through the still night they cross the devious fields slippery with blood oer arms and heaps of shields arriving where the thracian squadrons lay and eased in sleep the labours of the day ranged in three lines they view the prostrate band the horses yoked beside each warrior stand their arms in order on the ground reclined through the brown shade the fulgid weapons shined amidst lay rhesus stretchd in sleep profound and the white steeds behind his chariot bound the welcome sight ulysses first descries and points to diomed the tempting prize the man the coursers and the car behold described by dolon with the arms of gold now brave tydides now thy courage try approach the chariot and the steeds untie or if thy soul aspire to fiercer deeds urge thou the slaughter while i seize the steeds pallas this said her heros bosom warms breathed in his heart and strung his nervous arms whereer he passd a purple stream pursued his thirsty falchion fat with hostile blood bathed all his footsteps dyed the fields with gore and a low groan remurmurd through the shore so the grim lion from his nightly den oerleaps the fences and invades the pen on sheep or goats resistless in his way he falls and foaming rends the guardless prey nor stoppd the fury of his vengeful hand till twelve lay breathless of the thracian band ulysses following as his partner slew back by the foot each slaughterd warrior drew the milkwhite coursers studious to convey safe to the ships he wisely cleared the way lest the fierce steeds not yet to battles bred should start and tremble at the heaps of dead now twelve despatchd the monarch last they found tydides falchion fixd him to the ground just then a deathful dream minerva sent a warlike form appeard before his tent whose visionary steel his bosom tore so dreamd the monarch and awaked no more ulysses now the snowy steeds detains and leads them fastend by the silver reins these with his bow unbent he lashd along the scourge forgot on rhesus chariot hung then gave his friend the signal to retire but him new dangers new achievements fire doubtful he stood or with his reeking blade to send more heroes to the infernal shade drag off the car where rhesus armour lay or heave with manly force and lift away while unresolved the son of tydeus stands pallas appears and thus her chief commands enough my son from further slaughter cease regard thy safety and depart in peace haste to the ships the gotten spoils enjoy nor tempt too far the hostile gods of troy the voice divine confessd the martial maid in haste he mounted and her word obeyd the coursers fly before ulysses bow swift as the wind and white as wintersnow not unobserved they passd the god of light had watchd his troy and markd minervas flight saw tydeus son with heavenly succour blessd and vengeful anger filld his sacred breast swift to the trojan camp descends the power and wakes hippocoon in the morninghour on rhesus side accustomd to attend a faithful kinsman and instructive friend he rose and saw the field deformd with blood an empty space where late the coursers stood the yetwarm thracians panting on the coast for each he wept but for his rhesus most now while on rhesus name he calls in vain the gathering tumult spreads oer all the plain on heaps the trojans rush with wild affright and wondering view the slaughters of the night meanwhile the chiefs arriving at the shade where late the spoils of hectors spy were laid ulysses stoppd to him tydides bore the trophy dropping yet with dolons gore then mounts again again their nimbler feet the coursers ply and thunder towards the fleet illustration diomed and ulysses returning with the spoils of rhesus old nestor first perceived the approaching sound bespeaking thus the grecian peers around methinks the noise of trampling steeds i hear thickening this way and gathering on my ear perhaps some horses of the trojan breed so may ye gods my pious hopes succeed the great tydides and ulysses bear returnd triumphant with this prize of war yet much i fear ah may that fear be vain the chiefs outnumberd by the trojan train perhaps even now pursued they seek the shore or oh perhaps those heroes are no more scarce had he spoke when lo the chiefs appear and spring to earth the greeks dismiss their fear with words of friendship and extended hands they greet the kings and nestor first demands say thou whose praises all our host proclaim thou living glory of the grecian name say whence these coursers by what chance bestowd the spoil of foes or present of a god not those fair steeds so radiant and so gay that draw the burning chariot of the day old as i am to age i scorn to yield and daily mingle in the martial field but sure till now no coursers struck my sight like these conspicuous through the ranks of fight some god i deem conferred the glorious prize blessd as ye are and favourites of the skies the care of him who bids the thunder roar and her whose fury bathes the world with gore father not so sage ithacus rejoind the gifts of heaven are of a nobler kind of thracian lineage are the steeds ye view whose hostile king the brave tydides slew sleeping he died with all his guards around and twelve beside lay gasping on the ground these other spoils from conquerd dolon came a wretch whose swiftness was his only fame by hector sent our forces to explore he now lies headless on the sandy shore then oer the trench the bounding coursers flew the joyful greeks with loud acclaim pursue straight to tydides high pavilion borne the matchless steeds his ample stalls adorn the neighing coursers their new fellows greet and the full racks are heapd with generous wheat but dolons armour to his ships conveyd high on the painted stern ulysses laid a trophy destind to the blueeyed maid now from nocturnal sweat and sanguine stain they cleanse their bodies in the neighbring main then in the polished bath refreshd from toil their joints they supple with dissolving oil in due repast indulge the genial hour and first to pallas the libations pour they sit rejoicing in her aid divine and the crownd goblet foams with floods of wine book xi argument the third battle and the acts of agamemnon agamemnon having armed himself leads the grecians to battle hector prepares the trojans to receive them while jupiter juno and minerva give the signals of war agamemnon bears all before him and hector is commanded by jupiter who sends iris for that purpose to decline the engagement till the king shall be wounded and retire from the field he then makes a great slaughter of the enemy ulysses and diomed put a stop to him for a time but the latter being wounded by paris is obliged to desert his companion who is encompassed by the trojans wounded and in the utmost danger till menelaus and ajax rescue him hector comes against ajax but that hero alone opposes multitudes and rallies the greeks in the meantime machaon in the other wing of the army is pierced with an arrow by paris and carried from the fight in nestors chariot achilles who overlooked the action from his ship sent patroclus to inquire which of the greeks was wounded in that manner nestor entertains him in his tent with an account of the accidents of the day and a long recital of some former wars which he remembered tending to put patroclus upon persuading achilles to fight for his countrymen or at least to permit him to do it clad in achilles armour patroclus on his return meets eurypylus also wounded and assists him in that distress this book opens with the eightandtwentieth day of the poem and the same day with its various actions and adventures is extended through the twelfth thirteenth fourteenth fifteenth sixteenth seventeenth and part of the eighteenth books the scene lies in the field near the monument of ilus the saffron morn with early blushes spread now rose refulgent from tithonus bed with newborn day to gladden mortal sight and gild the courts of heaven with sacred light when baleful eris sent by joves command the torch of discord blazing in her hand through the red skies her bloody sign extends and wrapt in tempests oer the fleet descends high on ulysses bark her horrid stand she took and thunderd through the seas and land even ajax and achilles heard the sound whose ships remote the guarded navy bound thence the black fury through the grecian throng with horror sounds the loud orthian song the navy shakes and at the dire alarms each bosom boils each warrior starts to arms no more they sigh inglorious to return but breathe revenge and for the combat burn illustration the descent of discord the king of men his hardy host inspires with loud command with great example fires himself first rose himself before the rest his mighty limbs in radiant armour dressd and first he cased his manly legs around in shining greaves with silver buckles bound the beaming cuirass next adornd his breast the same which once king cinyras possessd the fame of greece and her assembled host had reachd that monarch on the cyprian coast twas then the friendship of the chief to gain this glorious gift he sent nor sent in vain ten rows of azure steel the work infold twice ten of tin and twelve of ductile gold three glittering dragons to the gorget rise whose imitated scales against the skies reflected various light and arching bowd like colourd rainbows oer a showery cloud joves wondrous bow of three celestial dies placed as a sign to man amidst the skies a radiant baldric oer his shoulder tied sustaind the sword that glitterd at his side gold was the hilt a silver sheath encased the shining blade and golden hangers graced his bucklers mighty orb was next displayd that round the warrior cast a dreadful shade ten zones of brass its ample brim surround and twice ten bosses the bright convex crownd tremendous gorgon frownd upon its field and circling terrors filld the expressive shield within its concave hung a silver thong on which a mimic serpent creeps along his azure length in easy waves extends till in three heads the embroiderd monster ends last oer his brows his fourfold helm he placed with nodding horsehair formidably graced and in his hands two steely javelins wields that blaze to heaven and lighten all the fields that instant juno and the martial maid in happy thunders promised greece their aid high oer the chief they clashd their arms in air and leaning from the clouds expect the war close to the limits of the trench and mound the fiery coursers to their chariots bound the squires restraind the foot with those who wield the lighter arms rush forward to the field to second these in close array combined the squadrons spread their sable wings behind now shouts and tumults wake the tardy sun as with the light the warriors toils begun even jove whose thunder spoke his wrath distilld red drops of blood oer all the fatal field the woes of men unwilling to survey and all the slaughters that must stain the day near ilus tomb in order ranged around the trojan lines possessd the rising ground there wise polydamas and hector stood neas honourd as a guardian god bold polybus agenor the divine the brotherwarriors of antenors line with youthful acamas whose beauteous face and fair proportion matchd the ethereal race great hector coverd with his spacious shield plies all the troops and orders all the field as the red star now shows his sanguine fires through the dark clouds and now in night retires thus through the ranks appeard the godlike man plunged in the rear or blazing in the van while streamy sparkles restless as he flies flash from his arms as lightning from the skies as sweating reapers in some wealthy field ranged in two bands their crooked weapons wield bear down the furrows till their labours meet thick fall the heapy harvests at their feet so greece and troy the field of war divide and falling ranks are strowd on every side none stoopd a thought to base inglorious flight but horse to horse and man to man they fight not rabid wolves more fierce contest their prey each wounds each bleeds but none resign the day discord with joy the scene of death descries and drinks large slaughter at her sanguine eyes discord alone of all the immortal train swells the red horrors of this direful plain the gods in peace their golden mansions fill ranged in bright order on the olympian hill but general murmurs told their griefs above and each accused the partial will of jove meanwhile apart superior and alone the eternal monarch on his awful throne wrapt in the blaze of boundless glory sate and fixd fulfilld the just decrees of fate on earth he turnd his allconsidering eyes and markd the spot where ilions towers arise the sea with ships the fields with armies spread the victors rage the dying and the dead thus while the morningbeams increasing bright oer heavens pure azure spread the glowing light commutual death the fate of war confounds each adverse battle gored with equal wounds but now what time in some sequesterd vale the weary woodman spreads his sparing meal when his tired arms refuse the axe to rear and claim a respite from the sylvan war but not till half the prostrate forests lay stretchd in long ruin and exposed to day then nor till then the greeks impulsive might pierced the black phalanx and let in the light great agamemnon then the slaughter led and slew bienor at his peoples head whose squire oleus with a sudden spring leapd from the chariot to revenge his king but in his front he felt the fatal wound which pierced his brain and stretchd him on the ground atrides spoild and left them on the plain vain was their youth their glittering armour vain now soild with dust and naked to the sky their snowy limbs and beauteous bodies lie two sons of priam next to battle move the product one of marriage one of love in the same car the brotherwarriors ride this took the charge to combat that to guide far other task than when they wont to keep on idas tops their fathers fleecy sheep these on the mountains once achilles found and captive led with pliant osiers bound then to their sire for ample sums restored but now to perish by atrides sword pierced in the breast the baseborn isus bleeds cleft through the head his brothers fate succeeds swift to the spoil the hasty victor falls and stript their features to his mind recalls the trojans see the youths untimely die but helpless tremble for themselves and fly so when a lion ranging oer the lawns finds on some grassy lair the couching fawns their bones he cracks their reeking vitals draws and grinds the quivering flesh with bloody jaws the frighted hind beholds and dares not stay but swift through rustling thickets bursts her way all drownd in sweat the panting mother flies and the big tears roll trickling from her eyes amidst the tumult of the routed train the sons of false antimachus were slain he who for bribes his faithless counsels sold and voted helens stay for paris gold atrides markd as these their safety sought and slew the children for the fathers fault their headstrong horse unable to restrain they shook with fear and droppd the silken rein then in the chariot on their knees they fall and thus with lifted hands for mercy call o spare our youth and for the life we owe antimachus shall copious gifts bestow soon as he hears that not in battle slain the grecian ships his captive sons detain large heaps of brass in ransom shall be told and steel welltempered and persuasive gold these words attended with the flood of tears the youths addressd to unrelenting ears the vengeful monarch gave this stern reply if from antimachus ye spring ye die the daring wretch who once in council stood to shed ulysses and my brothers blood for profferd peace and sues his seed for grace no die and pay the forfeit of your race this said pisander from the car he cast and pierced his breast supine he breathed his last his brother leapd to earth but as he lay the trenchant falchion loppd his hands away his severd head was tossd among the throng and rolling drew a bloody train along then where the thickest fought the victor flew the kings example all his greeks pursue now by the foot the flying foot were slain horse trod by horse lay foaming on the plain from the dry fields thick clouds of dust arise shade the black host and intercept the skies the brasshoofd steeds tumultuous plunge and bound and the thick thunder beats the labouring ground still slaughtering on the king of men proceeds the distanced army wonders at his deeds as when the winds with raging flames conspire and oer the forests roll the flood of fire in blazing heaps the groves old honours fall and one refulgent ruin levels all before atrides rage so sinks the foe whole squadrons vanish and proud heads lie low the steeds fly trembling from his waving sword and many a car now lighted of its lord wide oer the field with guideless fury rolls breaking their ranks and crushing out their souls while his keen falchion drinks the warriors lives more grateful now to vultures than their wives perhaps great hector then had found his fate but jove and destiny prolongd his date safe from the darts the care of heaven he stood amidst alarms and death and dust and blood now past the tomb where ancient ilus lay through the mid field the routed urge their way where the wild figs the adjoining summit crown the path they take and speed to reach the town as swift atrides with loud shouts pursued hot with his toil and bathed in hostile blood now near the beechtree and the scan gates the hero halts and his associates waits meanwhile on every side around the plain dispersed

with twelve black ships he reachd percopes strand thence took the long laborious march by land now fierce for fame before the ranks he springs towering in arms and braves the king of kings atrides first discharged the missive spear the trojan stoopd the javelin passd in air then near the corslet at the monarchs heart with all his strength the youth directs his dart but the broad belt with plates of silver bound the point rebated and repelld the wound encumberd with the dart atrides stands till graspd with force he wrenchd it from his hands at once his weighty sword discharged a wound full on his neck that felld him to the ground stretchd in the dust the unhappy warrior lies and sleep eternal seals his swimming eyes oh worthy better fate oh early slain thy countrys friend and

warrior thus and thus the friend replied no martial toil i shun no danger fear let hector come i wait his fury here but jove with conquest crowns the trojan train and jove our foe all human force is vain he sighd but sighing raised his vengeful steel and from his car the proud thymbraeus fell molion the charioteer pursued his lord his death ennobled by ulysses sword there slain they left them in eternal night then plunged amidst the thickest ranks of fight so two wild boars outstrip the following hounds then swift revert and wounds return for wounds stern hectors conquests in the middle plain stood checkd awhile and greece respired again the sons of merops shone amidst the war towering they rode in one refulgent car in deep prophetic arts their father skilld had warnd his children from the trojan field fate urged them on the father warnd in vain they rushd to fight and perishd on the plain their breasts no more the vital spirit warms the stern tydides strips their shining arms hypirochus by great ulysses dies and rich hippodamus becomes his prize great jove from ide with slaughter fills his sight and level hangs the doubtful scale of fight by tydeus lance agastrophus was

his life behind this hector sees as his experienced eyes traverse the files and to the rescue flies shouts as he passd the crystal regions rend and moving armies on his march attend great diomed himself was seized with fear and thus bespoke his brother of the war mark how this way yon bending squadrons yield the storm rolls on and hector rules the field here stand his utmost forcethe warrior said swift at the word his ponderous javelin fled nor missd its aim but where the plumage danced razed the smooth cone and thence obliquely glanced safe in his helm the gift of phbus hands without a wound the trojan hero stands but yet so stunnd that staggering on the plain his arm and knee his sinking bulk sustain oer his dim sight the misty vapours rise and a short darkness shades his swimming eyes tydides followed to regain his lance while hector rose recoverd from the trance remounts his car and herds amidst the crowd the greek pursues him and exults aloud once more thank phbus for thy forfeit breath or thank that swiftness which outstrips the death well by apollo are thy prayers repaid and oft that partial power has lent his aid thou shall not long the death deserved withstand if any god assist tydides hand fly then inglorious but thy flight this day whole hecatombs of trojan ghosts shall pay him while he triumphd paris eyed from far the spouse of helen the fair cause of war around the fields his featherd shafts he sent from ancient ilus ruind monument behind the column placed he bent his bow and wingd an arrow at the unwary foe just as he stoopd agastrophuss crest to seize and drew the corslet from his breast the bowstring twangd nor flew the shaft in vain but pierced his foot and naild it to the plain the laughing trojan with a joyful spring leaps from his ambush and insults the king he bleeds he cries some god has sped my dart would the same god had fixd it in his heart so troy relieved from that widewasting hand should breathe from slaughter and in combat stand whose sons now tremble at his darted spear as scatterd lambs the rushing lion fear he dauntless thus thou conqueror of the fair thou womanwarrior with the curling hair vain archer trusting to the distant dart unskilld in arms to act a manly part thou hast but done what boys or women can such hands may wound but not incense a man nor boast the scratch thy feeble arrow gave a cowards weapon never hurts the brave not so this dart which thou mayst one day feel fate wings its flight and death is on the steel where this but lights some noble life expires its touch makes orphans bathes the cheeks of sires steeps earth in purple gluts the birds of air and leaves such objects as distract the fair ulysses hastens with a trembling heart before him steps and bending draws the dart forth flows the blood an eager pang succeeds tydides mounts and to the navy speeds now on the field ulysses stands alone the greeks all fled the trojans pouring on but stands collected in himself and whole and questions thus his own unconquerd soul what further subterfuge what hopes remain what shame inglorious if i quit the plain what danger singly if i stand the ground my friends all scatterd all the foes around yet wherefore doubtful let this truth suffice the brave meets danger and the coward flies to die or conquer proves a heros heart and knowing this i know a soldiers part such thoughts revolving in his careful breast near and more near the shady cohorts pressd these in the warrior their own fate enclose and round him deep the steely circle grows so fares a boar whom all the troop surrounds of shouting huntsmen and of clamorous hounds he grinds his ivory tusks he foams with ire his sanguine eyeballs glare with living fire by these by those on every part is plied and the red slaughter spreads on every side pierced through the shoulder first deiopis fell next ennomus and thoon sank to hell chersidamas beneath the navel thrust falls prone to earth and grasps the bloody dust charops the son of hippasus was near ulysses reachd him with the fatal spear but to his aid his brother socus flies socus the brave the generous and the wise near as he drew the warrior thus began o great ulysses muchenduring man not deeper skilld in every martial sleight than worn to toils and active in the fight this day two brothers shall thy conquest grace and end at once the great hippasian race or thou beneath this lance must press the field he said and forceful pierced his spacious shield through the strong brass the ringing javelin thrown ploughd half his side and bared it to the bone by pallas care the spear though deep infixd stoppd short of life nor with his entrails mixd the wound not mortal wise ulysses knew then furious thus but first some steps withdrew unhappy man whose death our hands shall grace fate calls thee hence and finishd is thy race nor longer check my conquests on the foe but pierced by this to endless darkness go and add one spectre to the realms below he spoke while socus seized with sudden fright trembling gave way and turnd his back to flight between his shoulders pierced the following dart and held its passage through the panting heart wide in his breast appeard the grisly wound he falls his armour rings against the ground then thus ulysses gazing on the slain famed son of hippasus there press the plain there ends thy narrow span assignd by fate heaven owes ulysses yet a longer date ah wretch no father shall thy corpse compose thy dying eyes no tender mother close but hungry birds shall tear those balls away and hovering vultures scream around their prey me greece shall honour when i meet my doom with solemn funerals and a lasting tomb then raging with intolerable smart he writhes his body and extracts the dart the dart a tide of spouting gore pursued and gladdend troy with sight of hostile blood now troops on troops the fainting chief invade forced he recedes and loudly calls for aid thrice to its pitch his lofty voice he rears the wellknown voice thrice menelaus hears alarmd to ajax telamon he cried who shares his labours and defends his side o friend ulysses shouts invade my ear distressed he seems and no assistance near strong as he is yet one opposed to all oppressd by multitudes the best may fall greece robbd of him must bid her host despair and feel a loss not ages can repair then where the cry directs his course he bends great ajax like the god of war attends the prudent chief in sore distress they found with bands of furious trojans compassd round as when some huntsman with a flying spear from the blind thicket wounds a stately deer down his cleft side while fresh the blood distils he bounds aloft and scuds from hills to hills till lifes warm vapour issuing through the wound wild mountainwolves the fainting beast surround just as their jaws his prostrate limbs invade the lion rushes through the woodland shade the wolves though hungry scour dispersed away the lordly savage vindicates his prey ulysses thus unconquerd by his pains a single warrior half a host sustains but soon as ajax leaves his towerlike shield the scattered crowds fly frighted oer the field atrides arm the sinking hero stays and saved from numbers to his car conveys victorious ajax plies the routed crew and first doryclus priams son he slew on strong pandocus next inflicts a wound and lays lysander bleeding on the ground as when a torrent swelld with wintry rains pours from the mountains oer the deluged plains and pines and oaks from their foundations torn a countrys ruins to the seas are borne fierce ajax thus oerwhelms the yielding throng men steeds and chariots roll in heaps along but hector from this scene of slaughter far raged on the left and ruled the tide of war loud groans proclaim his progress through the plain and deep scamander swells with heaps of slain there nestor and idomeneus oppose the warriors fury there the battle glows there fierce on foot or from the chariots height his sword deforms the beauteous ranks of fight the spouse of helen dealing darts around had pierced machaon with a distant wound in his right shoulder the broad shaft appeard and trembling greece for her physician feard to nestor then idomeneus begun glory of greece old neleus valiant son ascend thy chariot haste with speed away and great machaon to the ships convey a wise physician skilld our wounds to heal is more than armies to the public weal old nestor mounts the seat beside him rode the wounded offspring of the healing god he lends the lash the steeds with sounding feet shake the dry field and thunder toward the fleet but now cebriones from hectors car surveyd the various fortune of the war while here he cried the flying greeks are slain trojans on trojans yonder load the plain before great ajax see the mingled throng of men and chariots driven in heaps along i know him well distinguishd oer the field by the broad glittering of the sevenfold shield thither o hector thither urge thy steeds there danger calls and there the combat bleeds there horse and foot in mingled deaths unite and groans of slaughter mix with shouts of fight thus having spoke the drivers lash resounds swift through the ranks the rapid chariot bounds stung by the stroke the coursers scour the fields oer heaps of carcases and hills of shields the horses hoofs are bathed in heroes gore and dashing purple all the car before the groaning axle sable drops distils and mangled carnage clogs the rapid wheels here hector plunging through the thickest fight broke the dark phalanx and let in the light by the long lance the sword or ponderous stone the ranks he scatterd and the troops oerthrown ajax he shuns through all the dire debate and fears that arm whose force he felt so late but partial jove espousing hectors part shot heavenbred horror through the grecians heart confused unnerved in hectors presence grown amazed he stood with terrors not his own oer his broad back his moony shield he threw and glaring round by tardy steps withdrew thus the grim lion his retreat maintains beset with watchful dogs and shouting swains repulsed by numbers from the nightly stalls though rage impels him and though hunger calls long stands the showering darts and missile fires then sourly slow the indignant beast retires so turnd stern ajax by whole hosts repelld while his swoln heart at every step rebelld as the slow beast with heavy strength endued in some wide field by troops of boys pursued though round his sides a wooden tempest rain crops the tall harvest and lays waste the plain thick on his hide the hollow blows resound the patient animal maintains his ground scarce from the field with all their efforts chased and stirs but slowly when he stirs at last on ajax thus a weight of trojans hung the strokes redoubled on his buckler rung confiding now in bulky strength he stands now turns and backward bears the yielding bands now stiff recedes yet hardly seems to fly and threats his followers with retorted eye fixd as the bar between two warring powers while hissing darts descend in iron showers in his broad buckler many a weapon stood its surface bristled with a quivering wood and many a javelin guiltless on the plain marks the dry dust and thirsts for blood in vain but bold eurypylus his aid imparts and dauntless springs beneath a cloud of darts whose eager javelin launchd against the foe great apisaon felt the fatal blow from his torn liver the red current flowd and his slack knees desert their dying load the victor rushing to despoil the dead from paris bow a vengeful arrow fled fixd in his nervous thigh the weapon stood fixd was the point but broken was the wood back to the lines the wounded greek retired yet thus retreating his associates fired what god o grecians has your hearts dismayd oh turn to arms tis ajax claims your aid this hour he stands the mark of hostile rage and this the last brave battle he shall wage haste join your forces from the gloomy grave the warrior rescue and your country save thus urged the chief a generous troop appears who spread their bucklers and advance their spears to guard their wounded friend while thus they stand with pious care great ajax joins the band each takes new courage at the heros sight the hero rallies and renews the fight thus raged both armies like conflicting fires while nestors chariot far from fight retires his coursers steepd in sweat and staind with gore the greeks preserver great machaon bore that hour achilles from the topmost height of his proud fleet oerlookd the fields of fight his feasted eyes beheld around the plain the grecian rout the slaying and the slain his friend machaon singled from the rest a transient pity touchd his vengeful breast straight to menoetius muchloved son he sent graceful as mars patroclus quits his tent in evil hour then fate decreed his doom and fixd the date of all his woes to come why calls my friend thy loved injunctions lay whateer thy will patroclus shall obey o first of friends pelides thus replied still at my heart and ever at my side the time is come when yon despairing host shall learn the value of the man they lost now at my knees the greeks shall pour their moan and proud atrides tremble on his throne go now to nestor and from him be taught what wounded warrior late his chariot brought for seen at distance and but seen behind

asteropaeus aid next him the bravest at their armys head but he more brave than all the hosts he led now with compacted shields in close array the moving legions speed their headlong way already in their hopes they fire the fleet and see the grecians gasping at their feet while every trojan thus and every aid the advice of wise polydamas obeyd asius alone confiding in his car his vaunted coursers urged to meet the war unhappy hero and advised in vain those wheels returning neer shall mark the plain no more those coursers with triumphant joy restore their master to the gates of troy black death attends behind the grecian wall and great idomeneus shall boast thy fall fierce to the left he drives where from the plain the flying grecians strove their ships to gain swift through the wall their horse and chariots passd the gates halfopend to receive the last thither exulting in his force he flies his following host with clamours rend the skies to plunge the grecians headlong in the main such their proud hopes but all their hopes were vain to guard the gates two mighty chiefs attend who from the lapiths warlike race descend this polyptes great perithous heir and that leonteus like the god of war as two tall oaks before the wall they rise their roots in earth their heads amidst the skies whose spreading arms with leafy honours crownd forbid the tempest and protect the ground high on the hills appears their stately form and their deep roots for ever brave the storm so graceful these and so the shock they stand of raging asius and his furious band orestes acamas in front appear and nomaus and thoon close the rear in vain their clamours shake the ambient fields in vain around them beat their hollow shields the fearless brothers on the grecians call to guard their navies and defend the wall even when they saw troys sable troops impend and greece tumultuous from her towers descend forth from the portals rushd the intrepid pair opposed their breasts and stood themselves the war so two wild boars spring furious from their den roused with the cries of dogs and voice of men on every side the crackling trees they tear and root the shrubs and lay the forest bare they gnash their tusks with fire their eyeballs roll till some wide wound lets out their mighty soul around their heads the whistling javelins sung with sounding strokes their brazen targets rung fierce was the fight while yet the grecian powers maintaind the walls and mannd the lofty towers to save their fleet their last efforts they try and stones and darts in mingled tempests fly as when sharp boreas blows abroad and brings the dreary winter on his frozen wings beneath the lowhung clouds the sheets of snow descend and whiten all the fields below so fast the darts on either army pour so down the rampires rolls the rocky shower heavy and thick resound the batterd shields and the deaf echo rattles round the fields with shame repulsed with grief and fury driven the frantic asius thus accuses heaven in powers immortal who shall now believe can those too flatter and can jove deceive what man could doubt but troys victorious power should humble greece and this her fatal hour but like when wasps from hollow crannies drive to guard the entrance of their common hive darkening the rock while with unwearied wings they strike the assailants and infix their stings a race determined that to death contend so fierce these greeks their last retreats defend gods shall two warriors only guard their gates repel an army and defraud the fates these empty accents mingled with the wind nor moved great joves unalterable mind to godlike hector and his matchless might was owed the glory of the destined fight like deeds of arms through all the forts were tried and all the gates sustaind an equal tide through the long walls the stony showers were heard the blaze of flames the flash of arms appeard the spirit of a god my breast inspire to raise each act to life and sing with fire while greece unconquerd kept alive the war secure of death confiding in despair and all her guardian gods in deep dismay with unassisting arms deplored the day even yet the dauntless lapithae maintain the dreadful pass and round them heap the slain first damasus by polyptes steel pierced through his helmets brazen visor fell the weapon drank the mingled brains and gore the warrior sinks tremendous now no more next ormenus and pylon yield their breath nor less leonteus strews the field with death first through the belt hippomachus he gored then sudden waved his unresisted sword antiphates as through the ranks he broke the falchion struck and fate pursued the stroke iamenus orestes menon bled and round him rose a monument of dead meantime the bravest of the trojan crew bold hector and polydamas pursue fierce with impatience on the works to fall and wrap in rolling flames the fleet and wall these on the farther bank now stood and gazed by heaven alarmd by prodigies amazed a signal omen stoppd the passing host their martial fury in their wonder lost joves bird on sounding pinions beat the skies a bleeding serpent of enormous size his talons trussd alive and curling round he stung the bird whose throat received the wound mad with the smart he drops the fatal prey in airy circles wings his painful way floats on the winds and rends the heaven with cries amidst the host the fallen serpent lies they pale with terror mark its spires unrolld and joves portent with beating hearts behold then first polydamas the silence broke long weighd the signal and to hector spoke how oft my brother thy reproach i bear for words well meant and sentiments sincere true to those counsels which i judge the best i tell the faithful dictates of my breast to speak his thoughts is every freemans right in peace in war in council and in fight and all i move deferring to thy sway but tends to raise that power which i obey then hear my words nor may my words be vain seek not this day the grecian ships to gain for sure to warn us jove his omen sent and thus my mind explains its clear event the victor eagle whose sinister flight retards our host and fills our hearts with fright dismissd his conquest in the middle skies allowd to seize but not possess the prize thus though we gird with fires the grecian fleet though these proud bulwalks tumble at our feet toils unforeseen and fiercer are decreed more woes shall follow and more heroes bleed so bodes my soul and bids me thus advise for thus a skilful seer would read the skies to him then hector with disdain returnd fierce as he spoke his eyes with fury burnd are these the faithful counsels of thy tongue thy will is partial not thy reason wrong or if the purpose of thy heart thou vent sure heaven resumes the little sense it lent what coward counsels would thy madness move against the word the will reveald of jove the leading sign the irrevocable nod and happy thunders of the favouring god these shall i slight and guide my wavering mind by wandering birds that flit with every wind ye vagrants of the sky your wings extend or where the suns arise or where descend to right to left unheeded take your way while i the dictates of high heaven obey without a sign his sword the brave man draws and asks no omen but his countrys cause but why shouldst thou suspect the wars success none fears it more as none promotes it less though all our chiefs amidst yon ships expire trust thy own cowardice to escape their fire troy and her sons may find a general grave but thou canst live for thou canst be a slave yet should the fears that wary mind suggests spread their cold poison through our soldiers breasts my javelin can revenge so base a part and free the soul that quivers in thy heart furious he spoke and rushing to the wall calls on his host his host obey the call with ardour follow where their leader flies redoubling clamours thunder in the skies jove breathes a whirlwind from the hills of ide and drifts of dust the clouded navy hide he fills the greeks with terror and dismay and gives great hector the predestined day strong in themselves but stronger in his aid close to the works their rigid siege they laid in vain the mounds and massy beams defend while these they undermine and those they rend upheaved the piles that prop the solid wall and heaps on heaps the smoky ruins fall greece on her ramparts stands the fierce alarms the crowded bulwarks blaze with waving arms shield touching shield a long refulgent row whence hissing darts incessant rain below the bold ajaces fly from tower to tower and rouse with flame divine the grecian power the generous impulse every greek obeys threats urge the fearful and the valiant praise fellows in arms whose deeds are known to fame and you whose ardour hopes an equal name since not alike endued with force or art behold a day when each may act his part a day to fire the brave and warm the cold to gain new glories or augment the old urge those who stand and those who faint excite drown hectors vaunts in loud exhorts of fight conquest not safety fill the thoughts of all seek not your fleet but sally from the wall so jove once more may drive their routed train and troy lie trembling in her walls again their ardour kindles all the grecian powers and now the stones descend in heavier showers as when high jove his sharp artillery forms and opes his cloudy magazine of storms in winters bleak uncomfortable reign a snowy inundation hides the plain he stills the winds and bids the skies to sleep then pours the silent tempest thick and deep and first the mountaintops are coverd oer then the green fields and then the sandy shore bent with the weight the nodding woods are seen and one bright waste hides all the works of men the circling seas alone absorbing all drink the dissolving fleeces as they fall so from each side increased the stony rain and the white ruin rises oer the plain thus godlike hector and his troops contend to force the ramparts and the gates to rend nor troy could conquer nor the greeks would yield till great sarpedon towerd amid the field for mighty jove inspired with martial flame his matchless son and urged him on to fame in arms he shines conspicuous from afar and bears aloft his ample shield in air within whose orb the thick bullhides were rolld ponderous with brass and bound with ductile gold and while two pointed javelins arm his hands majestic moves along and leads his lycian bands so pressd with hunger from the mountains brow descends a lion on the flocks below so stalks the lordly savage oer the plain in sullen majesty and stern disdain in vain loud mastiffs bay him from afar and shepherds gall him with an iron war regardless furious he pursues his way he foams he roars he rends the panting prey resolved alike divine sarpedon glows with generous rage that drives him on the foes he views the towers and meditates their fall to sure destruction dooms the aspiring wall then casting on his friend an ardent look fired with the thirst of glory thus he spoke why boast we glaucus our extended reign where xanthus streams enrich the lycian plain our numerous herds that range the fruitful field and hills where vines their purple harvest yield our foaming bowls with purer nectar crownd our feasts enhanced with musics sprightly sound why on those shores are we with joy surveyd admired as heroes and as gods obeyd unless great acts superior merit prove and vindicate the bounteous powers above tis ours the dignity they give to grace the first in valour as the first in place that when with wondering eyes our martial bands behold our deeds transcending our commands such they may cry deserve the sovereign state whom those that envy dare not imitate could all our care elude the gloomy grave which claims no less the fearful and the brave for lust of fame i should not vainly dare in fighting fields nor urge thy soul to war but since alas ignoble age must come disease and deaths inexorable doom the life which others pay let us bestow and give to fame what we to nature owe brave though we fall and honourd if we live or let us glory gain or glory give he said his words the listening chief inspire with equal warmth and rouse the warriors fire the troops pursue their leaders with delight rush to the foe and claim the promised fight menestheus from on high the storm beheld threatening the fort and blackening in the field around the walls he gazed to view from far what aid appeard to avert the approaching war and saw where teucer with the ajaces stood of fight insatiate prodigal of blood in vain he calls the din of helms and shields rings to the skies and echoes through the fields the brazen hinges fly the walls resound heaven trembles roar the mountains thunders all the ground then thus to thoos hence with speed he said and urge the bold ajaces to our aid their strength united best may help to bear the bloody labours of the doubtful war hither the lycian princes bend their course the best and bravest of the hostile force but if too fiercely there the foes contend let telamon at least our towers defend and teucer haste with his unerring bow to share the danger and repel the foe swift at the word the herald speeds along the lofty ramparts through the martial throng and finds the heroes bathed in sweat and gore opposed in combat on the dusty shore ye valiant leaders of our warlike bands your aid said thoos peteus son demands your strength united best may help to bear the bloody labours of the doubtful war thither the lycian princes bend their course the best and bravest of the hostile force but if too fiercely here the foes contend at least let telamon those towers defend and teucer haste with his unerring bow to share the danger and repel the foe straight to the fort great ajax turnd his care and thus bespoke his brothers of the war now valiant lycomede exert your might and brave oleus prove your force in fight to you i trust the fortune of the field till by this arm the foe shall be repelld that done expect me to complete the day then with his sevenfold shield he strode away with equal steps bold teucer pressd the shore whose fatal bow the strong pandion bore high on the walls appeard the lycian powers like some black tempest gathering round the towers the greeks oppressd their utmost force unite prepared to labour in the unequal fight the war renews mixd shouts and groans arise tumultuous clamour mounts and thickens in the skies fierce ajax first the advancing host invades and sends the brave epicles to the shades sarpedons friend across the warriors way rent from the walls a rocky fragment lay in modern ages not the strongest swain could heave the unwieldy burden from the plain he poised and swung it round then tossd on high it flew with force and labourd up the sky full on the lycians helmet thundering down the ponderous ruin crushd his batterd crown as skilful divers from some airy steep headlong descend and shoot into the deep so falls epicles then in groans expires and murmuring to the shades the soul retires while to the ramparts daring glaucus drew from teucers hand a winged arrow flew the bearded shaft the destined passage found and on his naked arm inflicts a wound the chief who feard some foes insulting boast might stop the progress of his warlike host conceald the wound and leaping from his height retired reluctant from the unfinishd fight divine sarpedon with regret beheld disabled glaucus slowly quit the field his beating breast with generous ardour glows he springs to fight and flies upon the foes alcmaon first was doomd his force to feel deep in his breast he plunged the pointed steel then from the yawning wound with fury tore the spear pursued by gushing streams of gore down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound his brazen armour rings against the ground swift to the battlement the victor flies tugs with full force and every nerve applies it shakes the ponderous stones disjointed yield the rolling ruins smoke along the field a mighty breach appears the walls lie bare and like a deluge rushes in the war at once bold teucer draws the twanging bow and ajax sends his javelin at the foe fixd in his belt the featherd weapon stood and through his buckler drove the trembling wood but jove was present in the dire debate to shield his offspring and avert his fate the prince gave back not meditating flight but urging vengeance and severer fight then raised with hope and fired with glorys charms his fainting squadrons to new fury warms o where ye lycians is the strength you boast your former fame and ancient virtue lost the breach lies open but your chief in vain attempts alone the guarded pass to gain unite and soon that hostile fleet shall fall the force of powerful union conquers all this just rebuke inflamed the lycian crew they join they thicken and the assault renew unmoved the embodied greeks their fury dare and fixd support the weight of all the war nor could the greeks repel the lycian powers nor the bold lycians force the grecian towers as on the confines of adjoining grounds two stubborn swains with blows dispute their bounds they tug they sweat but neither gain nor yield one foot one inch of the contended field thus obstinate to death they fight they fall nor these can keep nor those can win the wall their manly breasts are pierced with many a wound loud strokes are heard and rattling arms resound the copious slaughter covers all the shore and the high ramparts drip with human gore as when two scales are charged with doubtful loads from side to side the trembling balance nods while some laborious matron just and poor with nice exactness weighs her woolly store till poised aloft the resting beam suspends each equal weight nor this nor that descends so stood the war till hectors matchless might with fates prevailing turnd the scale of fight fierce as a whirlwind up the walls he flies and fires his host with loud repeated cries advance ye trojans lend your valiant hands haste to the fleet and toss the blazing brands they hear they run and gathering at his call raise scaling engines and ascend the wall around the works a wood of glittering spears shoots up and all the rising host appears a ponderous stone bold hector heaved to throw pointed above and rough and gross below not two strong men the enormous weight could raise such men as live in these degenerate days yet this as easy as a swain could bear the snowy fleece he tossd and shook in air for jove upheld and lightend of its load the unwieldy rock the labour of a god thus armd before the folded gates he came of massy substance and stupendous frame with iron bars and brazen hinges strong on lofty beams of solid timber hung then thundering through the planks with forceful sway drives the sharp rock the solid beams give way the folds are shatterd from the crackling door leap the resounding bars the flying hinges roar now rushing in the furious chief appears gloomy as night and shakes two shining spears a dreadful gleam from his bright armour came and from his eyeballs flashd the living flame he moves a god resistless in his course and seems a match for more than mortal force then pouring after through the gaping space a tide of trojans flows and fills the place the greeks behold they tremble and they fly the shore is heapd with death and tumult rends the sky illustration greek altar book xiii argument the fourth battle continued in which neptune assists the greeks the acts of idomeneus neptune concerned for the loss of the grecians upon seeing the fortification forced by hector who had entered the gate near the station of the ajaces assumes the shape of calchas and inspires those heroes to oppose him then in the form of one of the generals encourages the other greeks who had retired to their vessels the ajaces form their troops in a close phalanx and put a stop to hector and the trojans several deeds of valour are performed meriones losing his spear in the encounter repairs to seek another at the tent of idomeneus this occasions a conversation between those two warriors who return together to the battle idomeneus signalizes his courage above the rest he kills othryoneus asius and alcathous deiphobus and neas march against him and at length idomeneus retires menelaus wounds helenus and kills pisander the trojans are repulsed on the left wing hector still keeps his ground against the ajaces till being galled by the locrian slingers and archers polydamas advises to call a council of war hector approves of his advice but goes first to rally the trojans upbraids paris rejoins polydamas meets ajax again and renews the attack the eightandtwentieth day still continues the scene is between the grecian wall and the seashore when now the thunderer on the seabeat coast had fixd great hector and his conquering host he left them to the fates in bloody fray to toil and struggle through the wellfought day then turnd to thracia from the field of fight those eyes that shed insufferable light to where the mysians prove their martial force and hardy thracians tame the savage horse and where the farfamed hippomolgian strays renownd for justice and for length of days thrice happy race that innocent of blood from milk innoxious seek their simple food jove sees delighted and avoids the scene of guilty troy of arms and dying men no aid he deems to either host is given while his high law suspends the powers of heaven meantime the monarch of the watery main observed the thunderer nor observed in vain in samothracia on a mountains brow whose waving woods oerhung the deeps below he sat and round him cast his azure eyes where idas misty tops confusedly rise below fair ilions glittering spires were seen the crowded ships and sable seas between there from the crystal chambers of the main emerged he sat and mournd his argives slain at jove incensed with grief and fury stung prone down the rocky steep he rushd along fierce as he passd the lofty mountains nod the forest shakes earth trembled as he trod and felt the footsteps of the immortal god from realm to realm three ample strides he took and at the fourth the distant gae shook far in the bay his shining palace stands eternal frame not raised by mortal hands this having reachd his brasshoofd steeds he reins fleet as the winds and deckd with golden manes refulgent arms his mighty limbs infold immortal arms of adamant and gold he mounts the car the golden scourge applies he sits superior and the chariot flies his whirling wheels the glassy surface sweep the enormous monsters rolling oer the deep gambol around him on the watery way and heavy whales in awkward measures play the sea subsiding spreads a level plain exults and owns the monarch of the main the parting waves before his coursers fly the wondering waters leave his axle dry deep in the liquid regions lies a cave between where tenedos the surges lave and rocky imbrus breaks the rolling wave there the great ruler of the azure round stoppd his swift chariot and his steeds unbound fed with ambrosial herbage from his hand and linkd their fetlocks with a golden band infrangible immortal there they stay the father of the floods pursues his way where like a tempest darkening heaven around or fiery deluge that devours the ground the impatient trojans in a gloomy throng embattled rolld as hector rushd along to the loud tumult and the barbarous cry the heavens reecho and the shores reply they vow destruction to the grecian name and in their hopes the fleets already flame but neptune rising from the seas profound the god whose earthquakes rock the solid ground now wears a mortal form like calchas seen such his loud voice and such his manly mien his shouts incessant every greek inspire but most the ajaces adding fire to fire illustration neptune rising from the sea tis yours o warriors all our hopes to raise oh recollect your ancient worth and praise tis yours to save us if you cease to fear flight more than shameful is destructive here on other works though troy with fury fall and pour her armies oer our batterd wall there greece has strength but this this part oerthrown her strength were vain i dread for you alone here hector rages like the force of fire vaunts of his gods and calls high jove his sire if yet some heavenly power your breast excite breathe in your hearts and string your arms to fight greece yet may live her threatend fleet maintain and hectors force and joves own aid be vain then with his sceptre that the deep controls he touchd the chiefs and steeld their manly souls strength not their own the touch divine imparts prompts their light limbs and swells their daring hearts then as a falcon from the rocky height her quarry seen impetuous at the sight forthspringing instant darts herself from high shoots on the wing and skims along the sky such and so swift the power of ocean flew the wide horizon shut him from their view the inspiring god oleus active son perceived the first and thus to telamon some god my friend some god in human form favouring descends and wills to stand the storm not calchas this the venerable seer short as he turned i saw the power appear i markd his parting and the steps he trod his own bright evidence reveals a god even now some energy divine i share and seem to walk on wings and tread in air with equal ardour telamon returns my soul is kindled and my bosom burns new rising spirits all my force alarm lift each impatient limb and brace my arm this ready arm unthinking shakes the dart the blood pours back and fortifies my heart singly methinks yon towering chief i meet and stretch the dreadful hector at my feet full of the god that urged their burning breast the heroes thus their mutual warmth expressd neptune meanwhile the routed greeks inspired who breathless pale with length of labours tired pant in the ships while troy to conquest calls and swarms victorious oer their yielding walls trembling before the impending storm they lie while tears of rage stand burning in their eye greece sunk they thought and this their fatal hour but breathe new courage as they feel the power teucer and leitus first his words excite then stern peneleus rises to the fight thoas deipyrus in arms renownd and merion next the impulsive fury found last nestors son the same bold ardour takes while thus the god the martial fire awakes oh lasting infamy oh dire disgrace to chiefs of vigorous youth and manly race i trusted in the gods and you to see brave greece victorious and her navy free ah nothe glorious combat you disclaim and one black day clouds all her former fame heavens what a prodigy these eyes survey unseen unthought till this amazing day fly we at length from troys oftconquerd bands and falls our fleet by such inglorious hands a rout undisciplined a straggling train not born to glories of the dusty plain like frighted fawns from hill to hill pursued a prey to every savage of the wood shall these so late who trembled at your name invade your camps involve your ships in flame a change so shameful say what cause has wrought the soldiers baseness or the generals fault fools will ye perish for your leaders vice the purchase infamy and life the price tis not your cause achilles injured fame anothers is the crime but yours the shame grant that our chief offend through rage or lust must you be cowards if your kings unjust prevent this evil and your country save small thought retrieves the spirits of the brave think and subdue on dastards dead to fame i waste no anger for they feel no shame but you the pride the flower of all our host my heart weeps blood to see your glory lost nor deem this day this battle all you lose a day more black a fate more vile ensues let each reflect who prizes fame or breath on endless infamy on instant death for lo the fated time the appointed shore hark the gates burst the brazen barriers roar impetuous hector thunders at the wall the hour the spot to conquer or to fall these words the grecians fainting hearts inspire and listening armies catch the godlike fire fixd at his post was each bold ajax found with wellranged squadrons strongly circled round so close their order so disposed their fight as pallas self might view with fixd delight or had the god of war inclined his eyes the god of war had ownd a just surprise a chosen phalanx firm resolved as fate descending hector and his battle wait an iron scene gleams dreadful oer the fields armour in armour lockd and shields in shields spears lean on spears on targets targets throng helms stuck to helms and man drove man along the floating plumes unnumberd wave above as when an earthquake stirs the nodding grove and levelld at the skies with pointing rays their brandishd lances at each motion blaze thus breathing death in terrible array the close compacted legions urged their way fierce they drove on impatient to destroy troy charged the first and hector first of troy as from some mountains craggy forehead torn a rocks round fragment flies with fury borne which from the stubborn stone a torrent rends precipitate the ponderous mass descends from steep to steep the rolling ruin bounds at every shock the crackling wood resounds still gathering force it smokes and urged amain whirls leaps and thunders down impetuous to the plain there stopsso hector their whole force he proved resistless when he raged and when he stoppd unmoved on him the war is bent the darts are shed and all their falchions wave around his head repulsed he stands nor from his stand retires but with repeated shouts his army fires trojans be firm this arm shall make your way through yon square body and that black array stand and my spear shall rout their scattering power strong as they seem embattled like a tower for he that junos heavenly bosom warms the first of gods this day inspires our arms he said and roused the soul in every breast urged with desire of fame beyond the rest forth marchd deiphobus but marching held before his wary steps his ample shield bold merion aimd a stroke nor aimd it wide the glittering javelin pierced the tough bullhide but pierced not through unfaithful to his hand the point broke short and sparkled in the sand the trojan warrior touchd with timely fear on the raised orb to distance bore the spear the greek retreating mournd his frustrate blow and cursed the treacherous lance that spared a foe then to the ships with surly speed he went to seek a surer javelin in his tent meanwhile with rising rage the battle glows the tumult thickens and the clamour grows by teucers arm the warlike imbrius bleeds the son of mentor rich in generous steeds ere yet to troy the sons of greece were led in fair pedaeus verdant pastures bred the youth had dwelt remote from wars alarms and blest in bright medesicastes arms this nymph the fruit of priams ravishd joy allied the warrior to the house of troy to troy when glory calld his arms he came and matchd the bravest of her chiefs in fame with priams sons a guardian of the throne he lived beloved and honourd as his own him teucer pierced between the throat and ear he groans beneath the telamonian spear as from some farseen mountains airy crown subdued by steel a tall ash tumbles down and soils its verdant tresses on the ground so falls the youth his arms the fall resound then teucer rushing to despoil the dead from hectors hand a shining javelin fled he saw and shunnd the death the forceful dart sung on and pierced amphimachuss heart cteatus son of neptunes forceful line vain was his courage and his race divine prostrate he falls his clanging arms resound and his broad buckler thunders on the ground to seize his beamy helm the victor flies and just had fastened on the dazzling prize when ajax manly arm a javelin flung full on the shields round boss the weapon rung he felt the shock nor more was doomd to feel secure in mail and sheathd in shining steel repulsed he yields the victor greeks obtain the spoils contested and bear off the slain between the leaders of the athenian line stichius the brave menestheus the divine deplored amphimachus sad object lies imbrius remains the fierce ajaces prize as two grim lions bear across the lawn snatchd from devouring hounds a slaughterd fawn in their fell

in air away at hectors feet the gory visage lay the god of ocean fired with stern disdain and pierced with sorrow for his grandson slain inspires the grecian hearts confirms their hands and breathes destruction on the trojan bands swift as a whirlwind rushing to the fleet he finds the lancefamed idomen of crete his pensive brow the generous care expressd with which a wounded soldier touchd his breast whom in the chance of war a javelin tore and his sad comrades from the battle bore him to the surgeons of the camp he sent that office paid he issued from his tent fierce for the fight to whom

and by foes repelld his tired slow steps he drags from off the field deiphobus beheld him as he passd and fired with hate a parting javelin cast the javelin errd but held its course along and pierced

pious arms he threw and from the rage of battle gently drew him his swift coursers on his splendid car rapt from the lessening thunder of the war to troy they drove him groaning from the shore and sprinkling as he passd the sands with gore meanwhile fresh slaughter bathes the sanguine ground heaps fall on heaps and heaven and earth resound bold aphareus by great neas bled as toward the chief he

antilochus as thoon turnd him round transpierced his back with a dishonest wound the hollow vein that to the neck extends along the chine his eager javelin rends supine he falls and to his social train spreads his imploring arms but spreads in vain thv exulting victor leaping where he lay from his broad shoulders tore the spoils away his time observed for closed by foes around on all sides thick the peals of arms resound his shield embossd the ringing storm sustains but he impervious and untouchd remains great neptunes care preserved from hostile rage this youth the joy of nestors glorious age in arms intrepid with the first he fought faced every foe and every danger sought his winged lance resistless as the wind obeys each motion of the masters mind restless it flies impatient to be free and meditates the distant enemy the son of asius adamas drew near and struck his target with the brazen spear fierce in his front but neptune wards the blow and blunts the javelin of th eluded foe in the broad buckler half the weapon stood splinterd on earth flew half the broken wood disarmd he mingled in the trojan crew but merions spear oertook him as he flew deep in the bellys rim an entrance found where sharp the pang and mortal is the wound bending he fell and doubled to the ground lay panting thus an ox in fetters tied while deaths strong pangs distend his labouring side his

pierced with his lance the hand that graspd the bow and nailed it to the yew the wounded hand traild the long lance that markd with blood the sand but good agenor gently from the wound the spear

through atrides shield pisanders spear fell shiverd on the field not so discouraged to the future blind vain dreams of conquest swell his haughty mind dauntless he rushes where the spartan lord like lightning brandishd his far beaming sword his left arm high opposed the shining shield his right beneath the coverd poleaxe held an olives cloudy grain the handle made distinct with studs and brazen was the blade this on the helm discharged a noble blow the plume droppd nodding to the plain below shorn from the crest atrides waved his steel deep through his front the weighty falchion fell the crashing bones before its force gave way in dust and blood the groaning hero lay forced from their ghastly orbs and spouting gore the clotted eyeballs tumble on the shore and fierce atrides spurnd him

crimes shall bend your glory down and whelm in ruins yon flagitious town o thou great father lord of earth and skies above the thought of man supremely wise if from thy hand the fates of mortals flow from whence this favour to an impious foe a godless crew abandond and unjust still breathing rapine violence and lust the best of things beyond their measure cloy sleeps balmy blessing loves endearing joy the feast the dance whateer mankind desire even the sweet charms of sacred numbers tire but troy for ever reaps a dire delight in thirst of slaughter and in lust of fight this said he seized while yet the carcase heaved the bloody armour which his train received then sudden mixd among the warring crew and the bold son of pylmenes slew harpalion had through asia travelld far following his martial father to the war through filial love he left his native shore never ah never to behold it more his unsuccessful spear he chanced to fling against the target of the spartan king thus of his lance disarmd from death he flies and turns around his apprehensive eyes him through the hip transpiercing as he fled the shaft of merion mingled with the dead beneath the bone the glancing point descends and driving down the swelling bladder rends sunk in his sad companions arms he lay and in short pantings sobbd his soul away like some vile worm extended on the ground while lifes red torrent gushd from out the wound him on his car the paphlagonian train in slow procession bore from off the plain the pensive father father now no more attends the mournful pomp along the shore and unavailing tears profusely shed and unrevenged deplored his offspring dead paris from far the moving sight beheld with pity softend and with fury swelld his honourd host a youth of matchless grace and loved of all the paphlagonian race with his full strength he bent his angry bow and wingd the featherd vengeance at the foe a chief there was the brave euchenor named for riches much and more for virtue famed who held his seat in corinths stately town polydus son a seer of old renown oft had the father told his early doom by arms abroad or slow disease at home he climbd his vessel prodigal of breath and chose the certain glorious path to death beneath his ear the pointed arrow went the soul came issuing at the narrow vent his limbs unnerved drop useless on the ground and everlasting darkness shades him round nor knew great hector how his legions yield wrappd in the cloud and tumult of the field wide on the left the force of greece commands and conquest hovers oer th achaian bands with such a tide superior virtue swayd and he that shakes the solid earth gave aid but in the centre hector fixd remaind where first the gates were forced and bulwarks gaind there on the margin of the hoary deep their naval station where the ajaces keep and where low walls confine the beating tides whose humble barrier scarce the foe divides where late in fight both foot and horse engaged and all the thunder of the battle raged there joind the whole botian strength remains the proud iaonians with their sweeping trains locrians and phthians and th epaean force but joind repel not hectors fiery course the flower of athens stichius phidas led bias and great menestheus at their head meges the strong the epaean bands controlld and dracius prudent and amphion bold the phthians medon famed for martial might and brave podarces active in the fight this drew from phylacus his noble line iphiclus son and that oleus thine young ajax brother by a stolen embrace he dwelt far distant from his native place by his fierce stepdame from his fathers reign expelld and exiled for her brother slain these rule the phthians and their arms employ mixd with botians on the shores of troy now side by side with like unwearied care each ajax laboured through the field of war so when two lordly bulls with equal toil force the bright ploughshare through the fallow soil joind to one yoke the stubborn earth they tear and trace large furrows with the shining share oer their huge limbs the foam descends in snow and streams of sweat down their sour foreheads flow a train of heroes followed through the field who bore by turns great ajax sevenfold shield wheneer he breathed remissive of his might tired with the incessant slaughters of the fight no following troops his brave associate grace in close engagement an unpractised race the locrian squadrons nor the javelin wield nor bear the helm nor lift the moony shield but skilld from far the flying shaft to wing or whirl the sounding pebble from the sling dexterous with these they aim a certain wound or fell the distant warrior to the ground thus in the van the telamonian train throngd in bright arms a pressing fight maintain far in the rear the locrian archers lie whose stones and arrows intercept the sky the mingled tempest on the foes they pour troys scattering orders open to the shower now had the greeks eternal fame acquired and the galld ilians to their walls retired but sage polydamas discreetly brave addressd great hector and this counsel gave though great in all thou seemst averse to lend impartial audience to a faithful friend to gods and men thy matchless worth is known and every art of glorious war thy own but in cool thought and counsel to excel how widely differs this from warring well content with what the bounteous gods have given seek not alone to engross the gifts of heaven to some the powers of bloody war belong to some sweet music and the charm of song to few and wondrous few has jove assignd a wise extensive allconsidering mind their guardians these the nations round confess and towns and empires for their safety bless if heaven have lodged this virtue in my breast attend o hector what i judge the best see as thou movst on dangers dangers spread and wars whole fury burns around thy head behold distressd within yon hostile wall how many trojans yield disperse or fall what troops outnumberd scarce the war maintain and what brave heroes at the ships lie slain here cease thy fury and the chiefs and kings convoked to council weigh the sum of things whether the gods succeeding our desires to yon tall ships to bear the trojan fires or quit the fleet and pass unhurt away contented with the conquest of the day i fear i fear lest greece not yet undone pay the large debt of last revolving sun achilles great achilles yet remains on yonder decks and yet oerlooks the plains the counsel pleased and hector with a bound leapd from his chariot on the trembling ground swift as he leapd his clanging arms resound to guard this post he cried thy art employ and here detain the scatterd youth of troy where yonder heroes faint i bend my way and hasten back to end the doubtful day this said the towering chief prepares to go shakes his white plumes that to the breezes flow and seems a moving mountain toppd with snow through all his host inspiring force he flies and bids anew the martial thunder rise to panthus son at hectors high command haste the bold leaders of the trojan band but round the battlements and round the plain for many a chief he lookd but lookd in vain deiphobus nor helenus the seer nor asius son nor asius self appear for these were pierced with many a ghastly wound some cold in death some groaning on the ground some low in dust a mournful object lay high on the wall some breathed their souls away far on the left amid the throng he found cheering the troops and dealing deaths around the graceful paris whom with fury moved opprobrious thus th impatient chief reproved illfated paris slave to womankind as smooth of face as fraudulent of mind where is deiphobus where asius gone the godlike father and th intrepid son the force of helenus dispensing fate and great othryoneus so feard of late black fate hangs oer thee from th avenging gods imperial troy from her foundations nods whelmd in thy countrys ruin shalt thou fall and one devouring vengeance swallow all when paris thus my brother and my friend thy warm impatience makes thy tongue offend in other battles i deserved thy blame though then not deedless nor unknown to fame but since yon rampart by thy arms lay low i scatterd slaughter from my fatal bow the chiefs you seek on yonder shore lie slain of all those heroes two alone remain deiphobus and helenus the seer each now disabled by a hostile spear go then successful where thy soul inspires this heart and hand shall second all thy fires what with this arm i can prepare to know till death for death be paid and blow for blow but tis not ours with forces not our own to combat strength is of the gods alone these words the heros angry mind assuage then fierce they mingle where the thickest rage around polydamas distaind with blood cebrion phalces stern orthaeus stood palmus with polyptes the divine and two bold brothers of hippotions line who reachd fair ilion from ascania far the former day the next engaged in war as when from gloomy clouds a whirlwind springs that bears joves thunder on its dreadful wings wide oer the blasted fields the tempest sweeps then gatherd settles on the hoary deeps the afflicted deeps tumultuous mix and roar the waves behind impel the waves before wide rolling foaming high and tumbling to the shore thus rank on rank the thick battalions throng chief urged on chief and man drove man along far oer the plains in dreadful order bright the brazen arms reflect a beamy light full in the blazing van great hector shined like mars commissiond to confound mankind before him flaming his enormous shield like the broad sun illumined all the field his nodding helm emits a streamy ray his piercing eyes through all the battle stray and while beneath his targe he flashd along shot terrors round that witherd een the strong thus stalkd he dreadful death was in his look whole nations feard but not an argive shook the towering ajax with an ample stride advanced the first and thus the chief defied hector come on thy empty threats forbear tis not thy arm tis thundering jove we fear the skill of war to us not idly given lo greece is humbled not by troy but heaven vain are the hopes that haughty mind imparts to force our fleet the greeks have hands and hearts long ere in flames our lofty navy fall your boasted city and your godbuilt wall shall sink beneath us smoking on the ground and spread a long unmeasured ruin round the time shall come when chased along the plain even thou shalt call on jove and call in vain even thou shalt wish to aid thy desperate course the wings of falcons for thy flying horse shalt run forgetful of a warriors fame while clouds of friendly dust conceal thy shame as thus he spoke behold in open view on sounding wings a dexter eagle flew to joves glad omen all the grecians rise and hail with shouts his progress through the skies farechoing clamours bound from side to side they ceased and thus the chief of troy replied from whence this menace this insulting strain enormous boaster doomd to vaunt in vain so may the gods on hector life bestow not that short life which mortals lead below but such as those of joves high lineage born the blueeyed maid or he that gilds the morn as this decisive day shall end the fame of greece and argos be no more a name and thou imperious if thy madness wait the lance of hector thou shalt meet thy fate that giantcorse extended on the shore shall largely feast the fowls with fat and gore he said and like a lion stalkd along with shouts incessant earth and ocean rung sent from his following host the grecian train with answering thunders filld the echoing plain a shout that tore heavens concave and above shook the fixd splendours of the throne of jove illustration greek earrings book xiv argument juno deceives jupiter by the girdle of venus nestor sitting at the table with machaon is alarmed with the increasing clamour of war and hastens to agamemnon on his way he meets that prince with diomed and ulysses whom he informs of the extremity of the danger agamemnon proposes to make their escape by night which ulysses withstands to which diomed adds his advice that wounded as they were they should go forth and encourage the army with their presence which advice is pursued juno seeing the partiality of jupiter to the trojans forms a design to overreach him she sets off her charms with the utmost care and the more surely to enchant him obtains the magic girdle of venus she then applies herself to the god of sleep and with some difficulty persuades him to seal the eyes of jupiter this done she goes to mount ida where the god at first sight is ravished with her beauty sinks in her embraces and is laid asleep neptune takes advantage of his slumber and succours the greeks hector is struck to the ground with a prodigious stone by ajax and carried off from the battle several actions succeed till the trojans much distressed are obliged to give way the lesser ajax signalizes himself in a particular manner but not the genial feast nor flowing bowl could charm the cares of nestors watchful soul his startled ears the increasing cries attend then thus impatient to his wounded friend what new alarm divine machaon say what mixd events attend this mighty day hark how the shouts divide and how they meet and now come full and thicken to the fleet here with the cordial draught dispel thy care let hecamede the strengthening bath prepare refresh thy wound and cleanse the clotted gore while i the adventures of the day explore he said and seizing thrasymedes shield his valiant offspring hastend to the field that day the son his fathers buckler bore then snatchd a lance and issued from the door soon as the prospect opend to his view his wounded eyes the scene of sorrow knew dire disarray the tumult of the fight the wall in ruins and the greeks in flight as when old oceans silent surface sleeps the waves just heaving on the purple deeps while yet the expected tempest hangs on high weighs down the cloud and blackens in the sky the mass of waters will no wind obey jove sends one gust and bids them roll away while wavering counsels thus his mind engage fluctuates in doubtful thought the pylian sage to join the host or to the general haste debating long he fixes on the last yet as he moves the sight his bosom warms the field rings dreadful with the clang of arms the gleaming falchions flash the javelins fly blows echo blows and all or kill or die him in his march the wounded princes meet by tardy steps ascending from the fleet the king of men ulysses the divine and who to tydeus owes his noble line their ships at distance from the battle stand in lines advanced along the shelving strand whose bay the fleet unable to contain at length beside the margin of the main rank above rank the crowded ships they moor who landed first lay highest on the shore supported on the spears they took their way unfit to fight but anxious for the day nestors approach alarmd each grecian breast whom thus the general of the host addressd o grace and glory of the achaian name what drives thee nestor from the field of fame shall then proud hector see his boast fulfilld our fleets in ashes and our heroes killd such was his threat ah now too soon made good on many a grecian bosom writ in blood is every heart inflamed with equal rage against your king nor will one chief engage and have i lived to see with mournful eyes in every greek a new achilles rise gerenian nestor then so fate has willd and allconfirming time has fate fulfilld not he that thunders from the aerial bower not jove himself upon the past has power the wall our late inviolable bound and best defence lies smoking on the ground even to the ships their conquering arms extend and groans of slaughterd greeks to heaven ascend on speedy measures then employ your thought in such distress if counsel profit aught arms cannot much though mars our souls incite these gaping wounds withhold us from the fight to him the monarch that our army bends that troy triumphant our high fleet ascends and that the rampart late our surest trust and best defence lies smoking in the dust all this from joves afflictive hand we bear who far from argos wills our ruin here past are the days when happier greece was blest and all his favour all his aid confessd now heaven averse our hands from battle ties and lifts the trojan glory to the skies cease we at length to waste our blood in vain and launch what ships lie nearest to the main leave these at anchor till the coming night then if impetuous troy forbear the fight bring all to sea and hoist each sail for flight better from evils well foreseen to run than perish in the danger we may shun thus he the sage ulysses thus replies while anger flashd from his disdainful eyes what shameful words unkingly as thou art fall from that trembling tongue and timorous heart oh were thy sway the curse of meaner powers and thou the shame of any host but ours a host by jove endued with martial might and taught to conquer or to fall in fight adventurous combats and bold wars to wage employd our youth and yet employs our age and wilt thou thus desert the trojan plain and have whole streams of blood been spilt in vain in such base sentence if thou couch thy fear speak it in whispers lest a greek should hear lives there a man so dead to fame who dares to think such meanness or the thought declares and comes it even from him whose sovereign sway the banded legions of all greece obey is this a generals voice that calls to flight while war hangs doubtful while his soldiers fight what more could troy what yet their fate denies thou givest the foe all greece becomes their prize no more the troops our hoisted sails in view themselves abandond shall the fight pursue but thy ships flying with despair shall see and owe destruction to a prince like thee thy just reproofs atrides calm replies like arrows pierce me for thy words are wise unwilling as i am to lose the host i force not greece to quit this hateful coast glad i submit whoeer or young or old aught more conducive to our weal unfold tydides cut him short and thus began such counsel if you seek behold the man who boldly gives it and what he shall say young though he be disdain not to obey a youth who from the mighty tydeus springs may speak to councils and assembled kings hear then in me the great oenides son whose honoured dust his race of glory run lies whelmd in ruins of the theban wall brave in his life and glorious in his fall with three bold sons was generous prothous blessd who pleurons walls and calydon possessd melas and agrius but who far surpassd the rest in courage neus was the last from him my sire from calydon expelld he passd to argos and in exile dwelld the monarchs daughter there so jove ordaind he won and flourishd where adrastus reignd there rich in fortunes gifts his acres tilld beheld his vines their liquid harvest yield and numerous flocks that whitend all the field such tydeus was the foremost once in fame nor lives in greece a stranger to his name then what for common good my thoughts inspire attend and in the son respect the sire though sore of battle though with wounds oppressd let each go forth and animate the rest advance the glory which he cannot share though not partaker witness of the war but lest new wounds on wounds oerpower us quite beyond the missile javelins sounding flight safe let us stand and from the tumult far inspire the ranks and rule the distant war he added not the listening kings obey slow moving on atrides leads the way the god of ocean to inflame their rage appears a warrior furrowed oer with age pressd in his own the generals hand he took and thus the venerable hero spoke atrides lo with what disdainful eye achilles sees his countrys forces fly blind impious man whose anger is his guide who glories in unutterable pride so may he perish so may jove disclaim the wretch relentless and oerwhelm with shame but heaven forsakes not thee oer yonder sands soon shall thou view the scattered trojan bands fly diverse while proud kings and chiefs renownd driven heaps on heaps with clouds involved around of rolling dust their winged wheels employ to hide their ignominious heads in troy he spoke then rushd amid the warrior crew and sent his voice before him as he flew loud as the shout encountering armies yield when twice ten thousand shake the labouring field such was the voice and such the thundering sound of him whose trident rends the solid ground each argive bosom beats to meet the fight and grisly war appears a pleasing sight meantime saturnia from olympus brow highthroned in gold beheld the fields below with joy the glorious conflict she surveyd where her great brother gave the grecians aid but placed aloft on idas shady height she sees her jove and trembles at the sight jove to deceive what methods shall she try what arts to blind his allbeholding eye at length she trusts her power resolved to prove the old yet still successful cheat of love against his wisdom to oppose her charms and lull the lord of thunders in her arms swift to her bright apartment she repairs sacred to dress and beautys pleasing cares with skill divine had vulcan formd the bower safe from access of each intruding power touchd with her secret key the doors unfold selfclosed behind her shut the valves of gold here first she bathes and round her body pours soft oils of fragrance and ambrosial showers the winds perfumed the balmy gale convey

the winds that from the olian hall roar through the woods and make whole forests fall less loud the woods when flames in torrents pour catch the dry mountain and its shades devour with such a rage the meeting hosts are driven and such a clamour shakes the sounding heaven the first bold javelin urged by hectors force direct at ajax bosom winged its course but there no pass the crossing belts afford one braced his shield and one sustaind his sword then back the disappointed trojan drew and cursed the lance that unavailing flew but scaped not ajax his tempestuous hand a ponderous stone upheaving

his load of armour sinking to the ground clanks on the field a dead and hollow sound loud shouts of triumph fill the crowded plain greece sees in hope troys great defender slain all spring to seize

wings of death oertook thee on the dart swift to perform heavens fatal will it fled full on the juncture of the neck and head and took the joint and cut the nerves in twain the dropping head first

phorbas the rich of all the trojan train whom hermes loved and taught the arts of gain full in his eye the weapon chanced to fall and from the fibres scoopd the rooted ball drove through the neck and hurld him to the plain he lifts his miserable arms in vain swift his broad falchion fierce peneleus spread and from the spouting shoulders struck his head to earth at once the head and helmet fly the lance yet sticking through the bleeding eye the victor seized and as aloft he shook the gory visage thus insulting spoke trojans your great ilioneus behold haste to his father let the tale be told let

swoon and neptune at the head of the greeks he is highly incensed at the artifice of juno who appeases him by her submissions she is then sent to iris and apollo juno repairing to the assembly of the gods attempts with extraordinary address to incense them against jupiter in particular she touches mars with a violent resentment he is ready to take arms but is prevented by minerva iris and apollo obey the orders of jupiter iris commands neptune to leave the battle to which after much reluctance and passion he consents apollo reinspires hector with vigour brings him back to the battle marches before him with his gis and turns the fortune of the fight he breaks down great part of the grecian wall the trojans rush in and attempt to fire the first line of the fleet but are as yet repelled by the greater ajax with a prodigious slaughter now in swift flight they pass the trench profound and many a chief lay gasping on the ground then stoppd and panted where the chariots lie fear on their cheek and horror in their eye meanwhile awakend from his dream of love on idas summit sat imperial jove round the wide fields he cast a careful view there saw the trojans fly the greeks pursue these proud in arms those scatterd oer the plain and midst the war the monarch of the main not far great hector on the dust he spies his sad associates round with weeping eyes ejecting blood and panting yet for breath his senses wandering to the verge of death the god beheld him with a pitying look and thus incensed to fraudful juno spoke o thou still adverse to the eternal will for ever studious in promoting ill thy arts have made the godlike hector yield and driven his conquering squadrons from the field canst thou unhappy in thy wiles withstand our power immense and brave the almighty hand hast thou forgot when bound and fixd on high from the vast concave of the spangled sky i hung thee trembling in a golden chain and all the raging gods opposed in vain headlong i hurld them from the olympian hall stunnd in the whirl and breathless with the fall for godlike hercules these deeds were done nor seemd the vengeance worthy such a son when by thy wiles induced fierce boreas tossd the shipwreckd hero on the coan coast him through a thousand forms of death i bore and sent to argos and his native shore hear this remember and our fury dread nor pull the unwilling vengeance on thy head lest arts and blandishments successless prove thy soft deceits and welldissembled love the thunderer spoke imperial juno mournd and trembling these submissive words returnd by every oath that powers immortal ties the foodful earth and allinfolding skies by thy black waves tremendous styx that flow through the drear realms of gliding ghosts below by the dread honours of thy sacred head and that unbroken vow our virgin bed not by my arts the ruler of the main steeps troy in blood and ranges round the plain by his own ardour his own pity swayd to help his greeks he fought and disobeyd else had thy juno better counsels given and taught submission to the sire of heaven thinkst thou with me fair empress of the skies the immortal father with a smile replies then soon the haughty seagod shall obey nor dare to act but when we point the way if truth inspires thy tongue proclaim our will to yon bright synod on the olympian hill our high decree let various iris know and call the god that bears the silver bow let her descend and from the embattled plain command the seagod to his watery reign while phbus hastes great hector to prepare to rise afresh and once more wake the war his labouring bosom reinspires with breath and calls his senses from the verge of death greece chased by troy even to achilles fleet shall fall by thousands at the heros feet he not untouchd with pity to the plain shall send patroclus but shall send in vain what youths he slaughters under ilions walls even my loved son divine sarpedon falls vanquishd at last by hectors lance he lies then nor till then shall great achilles rise and lo that instant godlike hector dies from that great hour the wars whole fortune turns pallas assists and lofty ilion burns not till that day shall jove relax his rage nor one of all the heavenly host engage in aid of greece the promise of a god i gave and seald it with the almighty nod achilles glory to the stars to raise such was our word and fate the word obeys the trembling queen the almighty order given swift from the idaean summit shot to heaven as some wayfaring man who wanders oer in thought a length of lands he trod before sends forth his active mind from place to place joins hill to dale and measures space with space so swift flew juno to the blessd abodes if thought of man can match the speed of gods there sat the powers in awful synod placed they bowd and made obeisance as she passd through all the brazen dome with goblets crownd they hail her queen the nectar streams around fair themis first presents the golden bowl and anxious asks what cares disturb her soul to whom the whitearmd goddess thus replies enough thou knowst the tyrant of the skies severely bent his purpose to fulfil unmoved his mind and unrestraind his will go thou the feasts of heaven attend thy call bid the crownd nectar circle round the hall but jove shall thunder through the ethereal dome such stern decrees such threatend woes to come as soon shall freeze mankind with dire surprise and damp the eternal banquets of the skies the goddess said and sullen took her place black horror saddend each celestial face to see the gathering grudge in every breast smiles on her lips a spleenful joy expressd while on her wrinkled front and eyebrow bent sat stedfast care and lowering discontent thus she proceedsattend ye powers above but know tis madness to contest with jove supreme he sits and sees in pride of sway your vassal godheads grudgingly obey fierce in the majesty of power controls shakes all the thrones of heaven and bends the poles submiss immortals all he wills obey and thou great mars begin and show the way behold ascalaphus behold him die but dare not murmur dare not vent a sigh thy own loved boasted offspring lies oerthrown if that loved boasted offspring be thy own stern mars with anguish for his slaughterd son smote his rebelling breast and fierce begun thus then immortals thus shall mars obey forgive me gods and yield my vengeance way descending first to yon forbidden plain the god of battles dares avenge the slain dares though the thunder bursting oer my head should hurl me blazing on those heaps of dead with that he gives command to fear and flight to join his rapid coursers for the fight then grim in arms with hasty vengeance flies arms that reflect a radiance through the skies and now had jove by bold rebellion driven discharged his wrath on half the host of heaven but pallas springing through the bright abode starts from her azure throne to calm the god struck for the immortal race with timely fear from frantic mars she snatchd the shield and spear then the huge helmet lifting from his head thus to the impetuous homicide she said by what wild passion furious art thou tossd strivst thou with jove thou art already lost shall not the thunderers dread command restrain and was imperial juno heard in vain back to the skies wouldst thou with shame be driven and in thy guilt involve the host of heaven ilion and greece no more should jove engage the skies would yield an ampler scene of rage guilty and guiltless find an equal fate and one vast ruin whelm the olympian state cease then thy offsprings death unjust to call heroes as great have died and yet shall fall why should heavens law with foolish man comply exempted from the race ordaind to die this menace fixd the warrior to his throne sullen he sat and curbd the rising groan then juno calld joves orders to obey the winged iris and the god of day go wait the thunderers will saturnia cried on yon tall summit of the fountful ide there in the fathers awful presence stand receive and execute his dread command she said and sat the god that gilds the day and various iris wing their airy way swift as the wind to idas hills they came fair nurse of fountains and of savage game there sat the eternal he whose nod controls the trembling world and shakes the steady poles veild in a mist of fragrance him they found with clouds of gold and purple circled round wellpleased the thunderer saw their earnest care and prompt obedience to the queen of air then while a smile serenes his awful brow commands the goddess of the showery bow iris descend and what we here ordain report to yon mad tyrant of the main bid him from fight to his own deeps repair or breathe from slaughter in the fields of air if he refuse then let him timely weigh our elder birthright and superior sway how shall his rashness stand the dire alarms if heavens omnipotence descend in arms strives he with me by whom his power was given and is there equal to the lord of heaven the allmighty spoke the goddess wingd her flight to sacred ilion from the idaean height swift as the rattling hail or fleecy snows drive through the skies when boreas fiercely blows so from the clouds descending iris falls and to blue neptune thus the goddess calls attend the mandate of the sire above in me behold the messenger of jove he bids thee from forbidden wars repair to thine own deeps or to the fields of air this if refused he bids thee timely weigh his elder birthright and superior sway how shall thy rashness stand the dire alarms if heavens omnipotence descend in arms strivst thou with him by whom all power is given and art thou equal to the lord of heaven what means the haughty sovereign of the skies the king of ocean thus incensed replies rule as he will his portiond realms on high no vassal god nor of his train am i three brother deities from saturn came and ancient rhea earths immortal dame assignd by lot our triple rule we know infernal pluto sways the shades below oer the wide clouds and oer the starry plain ethereal jove extends his high domain my court beneath the hoary waves i keep and hush the roarings of the sacred deep olympus and this earth in common lie what claim has here the tyrant of the sky far in the distant clouds let him control and awe the younger brothers of the pole there to his children his commands be given the trembling servile second race of heaven and must i then said she o sire of floods bear this fierce answer to the king of gods correct it yet and change thy rash intent a noble mind disdains not to repent to elder brothers guardian fiends are given to scourge the wretch insulting them and heaven great is the profit thus the god rejoind when ministers are blest with prudent mind warnd by thy words to powerful jove i yield and quit though angry the contended field not but his threats with justice i disclaim the same our honours and our birth the same if yet forgetful of his promise given to hermes pallas and the queen of heaven to favour ilion that perfidious place he breaks his faith with half the ethereal race give him to know unless the grecian train lay yon proud structures level with the plain howeer the offence by other gods be passd the wrath of neptune shall for ever last thus speaking furious from the field he strode and plunged into the bosom of the flood the lord of thunders from his lofty height beheld and thus bespoke the source of light behold the god whose liquid arms are hurld around the globe whose earthquakes rock the world desists at length his rebelwar to wage seeks his own seas and trembles at our rage else had my wrath heavens thrones all shaking round burnd to the bottom of his seas profound and all the gods that round old saturn dwell had heard the thunders to the deeps of hell well was the crime and well the vengeance spared even power immense had found such battle hard go thou my son the trembling greeks alarm shake my broad gis on thy active arm be godlike hector thy peculiar care swell his bold heart and urge his strength to war let ilion conquer till the achaian train fly to their ships and hellespont again then greece shall breathe from toils the godhead said his will divine the son of jove obeyd not half so swift the sailing falcon flies that drives a turtle through the liquid skies as phbus shooting from the idaean brow glides down the mountain to the plain below there hector seated by the stream he sees his sense returning with the coming breeze again his pulses beat his spirits rise again his loved companions meet his eyes jove thinking of his pains they passd away to whom the god who gives the golden day why sits great hector from the field so far what grief what wound withholds thee from the war the fainting hero as the vision bright stood shining oer him half unseald his sight what blest immortal with commanding breath thus wakens hector from the sleep of death has fame not told how while my trusty sword bathed greece in slaughter and her battle gored the mighty ajax with a deadly blow had almost sunk me to the shades below even yet methinks the gliding ghosts i spy and hells black horrors swim before my eye to him apollo be no more dismayd see and be strong the thunderer sends thee aid behold thy phbus shall his arms employ phbus propitious still to thee and troy inspire thy warriors then with manly force and to the ships impel thy rapid horse even i will make thy fiery coursers way and drive the grecians headlong to the sea thus to bold hector spoke the son of jove and breathed immortal ardour from above as when the pamperd steed with reins unbound breaks from his stall and pours along the ground with ample strokes he rushes to the flood to bathe his sides and cool his fiery blood his head now freed he tosses to the skies his mane dishevelld oer his shoulders flies he snuffs the females in the wellknown plain and springs exulting to his fields again urged by the voice divine thus hector flew full of the god and all his hosts pursue as when the force of men and dogs combined invade the mountain goat or branching hind far from the hunters rage secure they lie close in the rock not fated yet to die when lo a lion shoots across the way they fly at once the chasers and the prey so greece that late in conquering troops pursued and markd their progress through the ranks in blood soon as they see the furious chief appear forget to vanquish and consent to fear thoas with grief observed his dreadful course thoas the bravest of the tolian force skilld to direct the javelins distant flight and bold to combat in the standing fight not more in councils famed for solid sense than winning words and heavenly eloquence gods what portent he cried these eyes invades lo hector rises from the stygian shades we saw him late by thundering ajax killd what god restores him to the frighted field and not content that half of greece lie slain pours new destruction on her sons again he comes not jove without thy powerful will lo still he lives pursues and conquers still yet hear my counsel and his worst withstand the greeks main body to the fleet command but let the few whom brisker spirits warm stand the first onset and provoke the storm thus point your arms and when such foes appear fierce as he is let hector learn to fear the warrior spoke the listening greeks obey thickening their ranks and form a deep array each ajax teucer merion gave command the valiant leader of the cretan band and marslike meges these the chiefs excite approach the foe and meet the coming fight behind unnumberd multitudes attend to flank the navy and the shores defend full on the front the pressing trojans bear and hector first came towering to the war phbus himself the rushing battle led a veil of clouds involved his radiant head high held before him joves enormous shield portentous shone and shaded all the field vulcan to jove the immortal gift consignd to scatter hosts and terrify mankind the greeks expect the shock the clamours rise from different parts and mingle in the skies dire was the hiss of darts by heroes flung and arrows leaping from the bowstring sung these drink the life of generous warriors slain those guiltless fall and thirst for blood in vain as long as phbus bore unmoved the shield sat doubtful conquest hovering oer the field but when aloft he shakes it in the skies shouts in their ears and lightens in their eyes deep horror seizes every grecian breast their force is humbled and their fear confessd so flies a herd of oxen scatterd wide no swain to guard them and no day to guide when two fell lions from the mountain come and spread the carnage through the shady gloom impending phbus pours around them fear and troy and hector thunder in the rear heaps fall on heaps the slaughter hector leads first great arcesilas then stichius bleeds one to the bold botians ever dear and one menestheus friend and famed compeer medon and iasus neas sped this sprang from phelus and the athenians led but hapless medon from oleus came him ajax honourd with a brothers name though born of lawless love from home expelld a banishd man in phylac he dwelld pressd by the vengeance of an angry wife troy ends at last his labours and his life mecystes next polydamas oerthrew and thee brave clonius great agenor slew by paris deiochus inglorious dies pierced through the shoulder as he basely flies polites arm laid echius on the plain stretchd on one heap the victors spoil the slain the greeks dismayd confused disperse or fall some seek the trench some skulk behind the wall while these fly trembling others pant for breath and oer the slaughter stalks gigantic death on rushd bold hector gloomy as the night forbids to plunder animates the fight points to the fleet for by the gods who flies who dares but linger by this hand he dies no weeping sister his cold eye shall close no friendly hand his funeral pyre compose who stops to plunder at this signal hour the birds shall tear him and the dogs devour furious he said the smarting scourge resounds the coursers fly the smoking chariot bounds the hosts rush on loud clamours shake the shore the horses thunder earth and ocean roar apollo planted at the trenchs bound pushd at the bank down sank the enormous mound rolld in the ditch the heapy ruin lay a sudden road a long and ample way oer the dread fosse a late impervious space now steeds and men and cars tumultuous pass the wondering crowds the downward level trod before them flamed the shield and marchd the god then with his hand he shook the mighty wall and lo the turrets nod the bulwarks fall easy as when ashore an infant stands and draws imagined houses in the sands the sportive wanton pleased with some new play sweeps the slight works and fashiond domes away thus vanishd at thy touch the towers and walls the toil of thousands in a moment falls the grecians gaze around with wild despair confused and weary all the powers with prayer exhort their men with praises threats commands and urge the gods with voices eyes and hands experienced nestor chief obtests the skies and weeps his country with a fathers eyes o jove if ever on his native shore one greek enrichd thy shrine with offerd gore if eer in hope our country to behold we paid the fattest firstlings of the fold if eer thou signst our wishes with thy nod perform the promise of a gracious god this day preserve our navies from the flame and save the relics of the grecian name thus prayed the sage the eternal gave consent and peals of thunder shook the firmament presumptuous troy mistook the accepting sign and catchd new fury at the voice divine as when black tempests mix the seas and skies the roaring deeps in watery mountains rise above the sides of some tall ship ascend its womb they deluge and its ribs they rend thus loudly roaring and oerpowering all mount the thick trojans up the grecian wall legions on legions from each side arise thick

inch of barren sands still pressd and pressd by such inglorious hands the listening grecians feel their leaders flame and every kindling bosom pants for fame then mutual slaughters spread on either side by hector here the phocian schedius died there pierced by ajax sunk laodamas chief of the foot of old antenors race polydamas laid otus on the sand the fierce commander of the epeian band his

and battles won had saved the father and now saves the son full at the trojans head he urged his lance where the high plumes above the helmet dance new tingd with tyrian dye in dust below shorn from

panting heart and issued at his breast with thundering sound the warrior falls extended on the ground in rush the conquering greeks to spoil the slain but hectors voice excites his kindred train the hero most from hicetaon sprung fierce melanippus gallant brave and young he ere to troy the grecians crossd the main fed his large oxen on percots plain but when oppressd his country claimd his care returnd to ilion and excelld in war for this in priams court he held his place beloved no less than priams royal race him hector singled as his troops he led and thus inflamed him pointing to the dead

this said rushd forward on the foes with equal ardour melanippus glows then ajax thuso greeks respect your fame respect yourselves and learn an honest shame let mutual reverence mutual warmth inspire and catch from breast to breast the noble fire on valours side the odds of combat lie the brave live glorious or lamented die the wretch that trembles in the field of fame meets death and worse than death eternal shame his generous sense he not in vain imparts it sunk and rooted in the grecian hearts they join they throng they thicken at his call and flank the navy with a brazen wall shields touching shields in order blaze above and stop the trojans though impelld by jove the fiery spartan first with loud applause warms the bold son of nestor in his cause is there he said in arms a youth like you so strong to fight so active to pursue why stand you distant nor attempt a deed lift the bold lance and make some trojan bleed he said and backward to the lines retired forth rushd the youth with martial fury fired beyond the foremost ranks his lance he threw and round the black battalions cast his view the troops of troy recede with sudden fear while the swift javelin hissd along in air advancing melanippus met the dart with his bold breast and felt it in his heart thundering he falls his falling arms resound and his broad buckler rings against the ground the victor leaps upon his prostrate prize thus on a roe the wellbreathd beagle flies and rends his side freshbleeding with the dart the distant hunter sent into his heart observing hector to the rescue flew bold as he was antilochus withdrew so when a savage ranging oer the plain has torn the shepherds dog or shepherds swain while conscious of the deed he glares around and hears the gathering multitude resound timely he flies the yetuntasted food and gains the friendly shelter of the wood so fears the youth all troy with shouts pursue while stones and darts in mingled tempest flew but enterd in the grecian ranks he turns his manly breast and with new fury burns now on the fleet the tides of trojans drove fierce to fulfil the stern decrees of jove the sire of gods confirming thetis prayer the grecian ardour quenchd in deep despair but lifts to glory troys prevailing bands swells all their hearts and strengthens all their hands on idas top he waits with longing eyes to view the navy blazing to the skies then nor till then the scale of war shall turn the trojans fly and conquerd ilion burn these fates revolved in his almighty mind he raises hector to the work designd bids him with more than mortal fury glow and drives him like a lightning on the foe so mars when human crimes for vengeance call shakes his huge javelin and whole armies fall not with more rage a conflagration rolls wraps the vast mountains and involves the poles he foams with wrath beneath his gloomy brow like fiery meteors his red eyeballs glow the radiant helmet on his temple burns waves when he nods and lightens as he turns for jove his splendour round the chief had thrown and cast the blaze of both the hosts on one unhappy glories for his fate was near due to stern pallas and pelides spear yet jove deferrd the death he was to pay and gave what fate allowd the honours of a day now all on fire for fame his breast his eyes burn at each foe and single every prize still at the closest ranks the thickest fight he points his ardour and exerts his might the grecian phalanx moveless as a tower on all sides batterd yet resists his power so some tall rock oerhangs the hoary main by winds assaild by billows beat in vain unmoved it hears above the tempest blow and sees the watery mountains break below girt in surrounding flames he seems to fall like fire from jove and bursts upon them all bursts as a wave that from the cloud impends and swelld with tempests on the ship descends white are the decks with foam the winds aloud howl oer the masts and sing through every shroud pale trembling tired the sailors freeze with fears and instant death on every wave appears so pale the greeks the eyes of hector meet the chief so thunders and so shakes the fleet as when a lion rushing from his den amidst the plain of some widewaterd fen where numerous oxen as at ease they feed at large expatiate oer the ranker mead leaps on the herds before the herdsmans eyes the trembling herdsman far to distance flies some lordly bull the rest dispersed and fled he singles out arrests and lays him dead thus from the rage of jovelike hector flew all greece in heaps but one he seized and slew mycenian periphes a mighty name in wisdom great in arms well known to fame the minister of stern eurystheus ire against alcides copreus was his sire the son redeemd the honours of the race a son as generous as the sire was base oer all his countrys youth conspicuous far in every virtue or of peace or war but doomd to hectors stronger force to yield against the margin of his ample shield he struck his hasty foot his heels upsprung supine he fell his brazen helmet rung on the fallen chief the invading trojan pressd and plunged the pointed javelin in his breast his circling friends who strove to guard too late the unhappy hero fled or shared his fate chased from the foremost line the grecian train now man the next receding toward the main wedged in one body at the tents they stand walld round with sterns a gloomy desperate band now manly shame forbids the inglorious flight now fear itself confines them to the fight man courage breathes in man but nestor most the sage preserver of the grecian host exhorts adjures to guard these utmost shores and by their parents by themselves implores oh friends be men your generous breasts inflame with mutual honour and with mutual shame think of your hopes your fortunes all the care your wives your infants and your parents share think of each living fathers reverend head think of each ancestor with glory dead absent by me they speak by me they sue they ask their safety and their fame from you the gods their fates on this one action lay and all are lost if you desert the day he spoke and round him breathed heroic fires minerva seconds what the sage inspires the mist of

swings around nor fights like others fixd to certain stands but looks a moving tower above the bands high on the decks with vast gigantic stride the godlike hero stalks from side to side so when a horseman from the watery mead skilld in the manage of the bounding steed drives four fair coursers practised to obey to some great city through the public way safe in his art as side by side they run he shifts his seat and vaults from one to one and now to this and now to that he flies admiring numbers follow with their eyes from ship to ship thus ajax swiftly flew no less the wonder of the warring crew as furious hector thunderd threats aloud and rushd enraged before the trojan crowd then swift invades the ships whose beaky prores lay rankd contiguous on the bending shores so the strong eagle from his airy height who marks the swans or cranes embodied flight stoops down impetuous while they light for food and stooping darkens with his wings the flood jove leads him on with his

his peneleus sped full on the juncture of the neck and head the head divided by a stroke so just hung by the skin the body sunk to dust oertaken neamas by merion bleeds pierced through the shoulder as he mounts his steeds back from the car he tumbles to the ground his swimming eyes eternal shades surround next erymas was doomd his fate to feel his opend mouth received the cretan steel beneath the brain the point a passage tore crashd the thin bones and drownd the teeth in gore his mouth his eyes his nostrils pour a flood he sobs his soul out in the gush of blood as when the flocks neglected by the swain or kids or lambs lie scatterd oer the plain a troop of wolves the unguarded charge survey and rend the trembling unresisting prey thus on the foe the greeks impetuous came troy fled unmindful of her former fame but still at hector godlike ajax aimd still pointed at his breast his javelin flamed the trojan chief experienced in the field oer his broad shoulders spread the massy shield observed the storm of darts the grecians pour and on his buckler caught the ringing shower he sees for greece the scale of conquest rise yet stops and turns and saves his loved allies as when the hand of jove a tempest forms and rolls the cloud to blacken heaven with storms dark oer the fields the ascending vapour flies and shades the sun and blots the golden skies so from the ships along the dusky plain dire flight and terror drove the trojan train even hector fled through heads of disarray the fiery coursers forced their lord away while far behind his trojans fall confused wedged in the trench in one vast carnage bruised chariots on chariots roll the clashing spokes shock while the madding steeds break short their yokes in vain they labour up the steepy mound their charioteers lie foaming on the ground fierce on the rear with shouts patroclus flies tumultuous clamour fills the fields and skies thick drifts of dust involve their rapid flight clouds rise on clouds and heaven is snatchd from sight the affrighted steeds their dying lords cast down scour oer the fields and stretch to reach the town loud oer the rout was heard the victors cry where the war bleeds and where the thickest die where horse and arms and chariots lie oerthrown and bleeding heroes under axles groan no stop no check the steeds of peleus knew from bank to bank the immortal coursers flew highbounding oer the fosse the whirling car smokes through the ranks oertakes the flying war and thunders after hector hector flies patroclus shakes his lance but fate denies not with less noise with less impetuous force the tide of trojans urge their desperate course than when in autumn jove his fury pours and earth is loaden with incessant showers when guilty mortals break the eternal laws or judges bribed betray the righteous cause from their deep beds he bids the rivers rise and opens all the floodgates of the skies the impetuous torrents from their hills obey whole fields are drownd and mountains swept away loud roars the deluge till it meets the main and trembling man sees all his labours vain and now the chief the foremost troops repelld back to the ships his destined progress held bore down half troy in his resistless way and forced the routed ranks to stand the day between the space where silver simois flows where lay the fleets and where the rampires rose all grim in dust and blood patroclus stands and turns the slaughter on the conquering bands first pronous died beneath his fiery dart which pierced below the shield his valiant heart thestor was next who saw the chief appear and fell the victim of his coward fear shrunk up he sat with wild and haggard eye nor stood to combat nor had force to fly patroclus markd him as he shunnd the war and with unmanly tremblings shook the car and droppd the flowing reins him twixt the jaws the javelin sticks and from the chariot draws as on a rock that overhangs the main an angler studious of the line and cane some mighty fish draws panting to the shore not with less ease the barbed javelin bore the gaping dastard as the spear was shook he fell and life his heartless breast forsook next on eryalus he flies a stone large as a rock was by his fury thrown full on his crown the ponderous fragment flew and burst the helm and cleft the head in two prone to the ground the breathless warrior fell and death involved him with the shades of hell then low in dust epaltes echius lie ipheas evippus polymelus die amphoterus and erymas succeed and last tlepolemus and pyres bleed whereer he moves the growing slaughters spread in heaps on heaps a monument of dead when now sarpedon his brave friends beheld grovelling in dust and gasping on the field with this reproach his flying host he warms oh stain to honour oh disgrace to arms forsake inglorious the contended plain this hand unaided shall the war sustain the task be mine this heros strength to try who mows whole troops and makes an army fly he spake and speaking leaps from off the car patroclus lights and sternly waits the war as when two vultures on the mountains height stoop with resounding pinions to the fight they cuff they tear they raise a screaming cry the desert echoes and the rocks reply the warriors thus opposed in arms engage with equal clamours and with equal rage jove viewd the combat whose event foreseen he thus bespoke his sister and his queen the hour draws on the destinies ordain my godlike son shall press the phrygian plain already on the verge of death he stands his life is owed to fierce patroclus hands what passions in a parents breast debate say shall i snatch him from impending fate and send him safe to lycia distant far from all the dangers and the toils of war or to his doom my bravest offspring yield and fatten with celestial blood the field then thus the goddess with the radiant eyes what words are these o sovereign of the skies short is the date prescribed to mortal man shall jove for one extend the narrow span whose bounds were fixd before his race began how many sons of gods foredoomd to death before proud ilion must resign their breath were thine exempt debate would rise above and murmuring powers condemn their partial jove give the bold chief a glorious fate in fight and when the ascending soul has wingd her flight let sleep and death convey by thy command the breathless body to his native land his friends and people to his future praise a marble tomb and pyramid shall raise and lasting honours to his ashes give his fame tis all the dead can have shall live she said the cloudcompeller overcome assents to fate and ratifies the doom then touchd with grief the weeping heavens distilld a shower of blood oer all the fatal field the god his eyes averting from the plain laments his son predestined to be slain far from the lycian shores his happy native reign now met in arms the combatants appear each heaved the shield and poised the lifted spear from strong patroclus hand the javelin fled and passd the groin of valiant thrasymed the nerves unbraced no more his bulk sustain he falls and falling bites the bloody plain two sounding darts the lycian leader threw the first aloof with erring fury flew the next transpierced achilles mortal steed the generous pedasus of theban breed fixd in the shoulders joint he reeld around rolld in the bloody dust and pawd the slippery ground his sudden fall the entangled harness broke each axle crackled and the chariot shook when bold automedon to disengage the starting coursers and restrain their rage divides the traces with his sword and freed the encumbered chariot from the dying steed the rest move on obedient to the rein the car rolls slowly oer the dusty plain the towering chiefs to fiercer fight advance and first sarpedon whirld his weighty lance which oer the warriors shoulder took its course and spent in empty air its dying force not so patroclus nevererring dart aimd at his breast it pierced a mortal part where the strong fibres bind the solid heart then as the mountain oak or poplar tall or pine fit mast for some great admiral nods to the axe till with a groaning sound it sinks and spreads its honours on the ground thus fell the king and laid on earth supine before his chariot stretchd his form divine he graspd the dust distaind with streaming gore and pale in death lay groaning on the shore so lies a bull beneath the lions paws while the grim savage grinds with foamy jaws the trembling limbs and sucks the smoking blood deep groans and hollow roars rebellow through the wood then to the leader of the lycian band the dying chief addressd his last command glaucus be bold thy task be first to dare the glorious dangers of destructive war to lead my troops to combat at their head incite the living and supply the dead tell them i charged them with my latest breath not unrevenged to bear sarpedons death what grief what shame must glaucus undergo if these spoild arms adorn a grecian foe then as a friend and as a warrior fight defend my body conquer in my right that taught by great examples all may try like thee to vanquish or like me to die he ceased the fates suppressd his labouring breath and his eyes darkend with the shades of death the insulting victor with disdain bestrode the prostrate prince and on his bosom trod then drew the weapon from his panting heart the reeking fibres clinging to the dart from the wide wound gushd out a stream of blood and the soul issued in the purple flood his flying steeds the myrmidons detain unguided now their mighty master slain allimpotent of aid transfixd with grief unhappy glaucus heard the dying chief his painful arm yet useless with the smart inflicted late by teucers deadly dart supported on his better hand he stayd to phbus then twas all he could he prayd allseeing monarch whether lycias coast or sacred ilion thy bright presence boast powerful alike to ease the wretchs smart o hear me god of every healing art lo stiff with clotted blood and pierced with pain that thrills my arm and shoots through every vein i stand unable to sustain the spear and sigh at distance from the glorious war low in the dust is great sarpedon laid nor jove vouchsafed his hapless offspring aid but thou o god of health thy succour lend to guard the relics of my slaughterd friend for thou though distant canst restore my might to head my lycians and support the fight apollo heard and suppliant as he stood his heavenly hand restraind the flux of blood he drew the dolours from the wounded part and breathed a spirit in his rising heart renewd by art divine the hero stands and owns the assistance of immortal hands first to the fight his native troops he warms then loudly calls on troys vindictive arms with ample strides he stalks from place to place now fires agenor now polydamas neas next and hector he accosts inflaming thus the rage of all their hosts what thoughts regardless chief thy breast employ oh too forgetful of the friends of troy those generous friends who from their country far breathe their brave souls out in anothers war see where in dust the great sarpedon lies in action valiant and in council wise who guarded right and kept his people free to all his lycians lost and lost to thee stretchd by patroclus arm on yonder plains o save from hostile rage his loved remains ah let not greece his conquerd trophies boast nor on his corse revenge her heroes lost he spoke each leader in his grief partook troy at the loss through all her legions shook transfixd with deep regret they view oerthrown at once his countrys pillar and their own a chief who led to troys beleaguerd wall a host of heroes and outshined them all fired they rush on first hector seeks the foes and with superior vengeance greatly glows but oer the dead the fierce patroclus stands and rousing ajax roused the listening bands heroes be men be what you were before or weigh the great occasion and be more the chief who taught our lofty walls to yield lies pale in death extended on the field to guard his body troy in numbers flies tis half the glory to maintain our prize haste strip his arms the slaughter round him spread and send the living lycians to the dead the heroes kindle at his fierce command the martial squadrons close on either hand here troy and lycia charge with loud alarms thessalia there and greece oppose their arms with horrid shouts they circle round the slain the clash of armour rings oer all the plain great jove to swell the horrors of the fight oer the fierce armies pours pernicious night and round his son confounds the warring hosts his fate ennobling with a crowd of ghosts now greece gives way and great epigeus falls agacleus son from budiums lofty walls who chased for murder thence a suppliant came to peleus and the silverfooted dame now sent to troy achilles arms to aid he pays due vengeance to his kinsmans shade soon as his luckless hand had touchd the dead a rocks large fragment thunderd on his head hurld by hectorean force it cleft in twain his shatterd helm and stretchd him oer the slain fierce to the van of fight patroclus came and like an eagle darting at his game sprung on the trojan and the lycian band what grief thy heart what fury urged thy hand o generous greek when with full vigour thrown at sthenelaus flew the weighty stone which sunk him to the dead when troy too near that arm drew back and hector learnd to fear far as an able hand a lance can throw or at the lists or at the fighting foe so far the trojans from their lines retired till glaucus turning all the rest inspired then bathyclaeus fell beneath his rage the only hope of chalcons trembling age wide oer the land was stretchd his large domain with stately seats and riches blest in vain him bold with youth and eager to pursue the flying lycians glaucus met and slew pierced through the bosom with a sudden wound he fell and falling made the fields resound the achaians sorrow for their heroes slain with conquering shouts the trojans shake the plain and crowd to spoil the dead the greeks oppose an iron circle round the carcase grows then brave laogonus resignd his breath despatchd by merion to the shades of death on idas holy hill he made abode the priest of jove and honourd like his god between the jaw and ear the javelin went the soul exhaling issued at the vent his spear neas at the victor threw who stooping forward from the death withdrew the lance hissd harmless oer his covering shield and trembling struck and rooted in the field there yet scarce spent it quivers on the plain sent by the great neas arm in vain swift as thou art the raging hero cries and skilld in dancing to dispute the prize my spear the destined passage had it found had fixd thy active vigour to the ground o valiant leader of the dardan host insulted merion thus retorts the boast strong as you are tis mortal force you trust an arm as strong may stretch thee in the dust and if to this my lance thy fate be given vain are thy vaunts success is still from heaven this instant sends thee down to plutos coast mine is the glory his thy parting ghost o friend menoetius son this answer gave with words to combat ill befits the brave not empty boasts the sons of troy repel your swords must plunge them to the shades of hell to speak beseems the council but to dare in glorious action is the task of war this said patroclus to the battle flies great merion follows and new shouts arise shields helmets rattle as the warriors close and thick and heavy sounds the storm of blows as through the shrilling vale or mountain ground the labours of the woodmans axe resound blows following blows are heard reechoing wide while crackling forests fall on every side thus echoed all the fields with loud alarms so fell the warriors and so rung their arms now great sarpedon on the sandy shore his heavenly form defaced with dust and gore and stuck with darts by warring heroes shed lies undistinguishd from the vulgar dead his longdisputed corse the chiefs enclose on every side the busy combat grows thick as beneath some shepherds thatchd abode the pails high foaming with a milky flood the buzzing flies a persevering train incessant swarm and chased return again jove viewd the combat with a stern survey and eyes that flashd intolerable day fixd on the field his sight his breast debates the vengeance due and meditates the fates whether to urge their prompt effect and call the force of hector to patroclus fall this instant see his shortlived trophies won and stretch him breathless on his slaughterd son or yet with many a souls untimely flight augment the fame and horror of the fight to crown achilles valiant friend with praise at length he dooms and that his last of days shall set in glory bids him drive the foe nor unattended see the shades below then hectors mind he fills with dire dismay he mounts his car and calls his hosts away sunk with troys heavy fates he sees decline the scales of jove and pants with awe divine then nor before the hardy lycians fled and left their monarch with the common dead around in heaps on heaps a dreadful wall of carnage rises as the heroes fall so jove decreed at length the greeks obtain the prize contested and despoil the slain the radiant arms are by patroclus borne patroclus ships the glorious spoils adorn then thus to phbus in the realms above spoke from his throne the cloudcompelling jove descend my phbus on the phrygian plain and from the fight convey sarpedon slain then bathe his body in the crystal flood with dust dishonourd and deformd with blood oer all his limbs ambrosial odours shed and with celestial robes adorn the dead those rites discharged his sacred corse bequeath to the soft arms of silent sleep and death they to his friends the immortal charge shall bear his friends a tomb and pyramid shall rear what honour mortals after death receive those unavailing honours we may give illustration sleep and death conveying the body of sarpedon to lycia apollo bows and from mount idas height swift to the field precipitates his flight thence from the war the breathless hero bore veild in a cloud to silver simois shore there bathed his honourable wounds and dressd his manly members in the immortal vest and with perfumes of sweet ambrosial dews restores his freshness and his form renews then sleep and death two twins of winged race of matchless swiftness but of silent pace received sarpedon at the gods command and in a moment reachd the lycian land the corse amidst his weeping friends they laid where endless honours wait the sacred shade meanwhile patroclus pours along the plains with foaming coursers and with loosend reins fierce on the trojan and the lycian crew ah blind to fate thy headlong fury flew against what fate and powerful jove ordain vain was thy friends command thy courage vain for he the god whose counsels uncontrolld dismay the mighty and confound the bold the god who gives resumes and orders all he urged thee on and urged thee on to fall who first brave hero by that arm was slain who last beneath thy vengeance pressd the plain when heaven itself thy fatal fury led and calld to fill the number of the dead adrestus first autonous then succeeds echeclus follows next young megas bleeds epistor melanippus bite the ground the slaughter elasus and mulius crownd then sunk pylartes to eternal night the rest dispersing trust their fates to flight now troy had stoopd beneath his matchless power but flaming phbus kept the sacred tower thrice at the battlements patroclus strook his blazing gis thrice apollo shook he tried the fourth when bursting from the cloud a more than mortal voice was heard aloud patroclus cease this heavendefended wall defies thy lance not fated yet to fall thy friend thy greater far it shall withstand troy shall not stoop even to achilles hand so spoke the god who darts celestial fires the greek obeys him and with awe retires while hector checking at the scan gates his panting coursers in his breast debates or in the field his forces to employ or draw the troops within the walls of troy thus while he thought beside him phbus stood in asius shape who reigned by sangars flood thy brother hecuba from dymas sprung a valiant warrior haughty bold and young thus he accosts him what a shameful sight god is it hector that forbears the fight were thine my vigour this successful spear should soon convince thee of so false a fear turn thee ah turn thee to the field of fame and in patroclus blood efface thy shame perhaps apollo shall thy arms succeed and heaven ordains him by thy lance to bleed so spoke the inspiring god then took his flight and plunged amidst the tumult of the fight he bids cebrion drive the rapid car the lash resounds the coursers rush to war the god the grecians sinking souls depressd and pourd swift spirits through each trojan breast patroclus lights impatient for the fight a spear his left a stone employs his right with all his nerves he drives it at the foe pointed above and rough and gross below the falling ruin crushd cebrions head the lawless offspring of king priams bed his front brows eyes one undistinguishd wound the bursting balls drop sightless to the ground the charioteer while yet he held the rein struck from the car falls headlong on the plain to the dark shades the soul unwilling glides while the proud victor thus his fall derides good heaven what active feats yon artist shows what skilful divers are our phrygian foes mark with what ease they sink into the sand pity that all their practice is by land then rushing sudden on his prostrate prize to spoil the carcase fierce patroclus flies swift as a lion terrible and bold that sweeps the field depopulates the fold pierced through the dauntless heart then tumbles slain and from his fatal courage finds his bane at once bold hector leaping from his car defends the body and provokes the war thus for some slaughterd hind with equal rage two lordly rulers of the wood engage stung with fierce hunger each the prey invades and echoing roars rebellow through the shades stern hector fastens on the warriors head and by the foot patroclus drags the dead while all around confusion rage and fright mix the contending hosts in mortal fight so pent by hills the wild winds roar aloud in the deep bosom of some gloomy wood leaves arms and trees aloft in air are blown the broad oaks crackle and the sylvans groan this way and that the rattling thicket bends and the whole forest in one crash descends not with less noise with less tumultuous rage in dreadful shock the mingled hosts engage darts showerd on darts now round the carcase ring now flights of arrows bounding from the string stones follow stones some clatter on the fields some hard and heavy shake the sounding shields but where the rising whirlwind clouds the plains sunk in soft dust the mighty chief remains and stretchd in death forgets the guiding reins now flaming from the zenith sol had driven his fervid orb through half the vault of heaven while on each host with equal tempests fell the showering darts and numbers sank to hell but when his evening wheels oerhung the main glad conquest rested on the grecian train then from amidst the tumult and alarms they draw the conquerd corse and radiant arms then rash patroclus with new fury glows and breathing slaughter pours amid the foes thrice on the press like mars himself he flew and thrice three heroes at each onset slew there ends thy glory there the fates untwine the last black remnant of so bright a line apollo dreadful stops thy middle way death calls and heaven allows no longer day for lo the god in dusky clouds enshrined approaching dealt a staggering blow behind the weighty shock his neck and shoulders feel his eyes flash sparkles his stunnd senses reel in giddy darkness far to distance flung his bounding helmet on the champaign rung achilles plume is staind with dust and gore that plume which never stoopd to earth before long used untouchd in fighting fields to shine and shade the temples of the mad divine jove dooms it now on hectors helm to nod not longfor fate pursues him and the god his spear in shivers falls his ample shield drops from his arm his baldric strows the field the corslet his astonishd breast forsakes loose is each joint each nerve with horror shakes stupid he stares and allassistless stands such is the force of more than mortal hands a dardan youth there was well known to fame from panthus sprung euphorbus was his name famed for the manage of the foaming horse skilld in the dart and matchless in the course full twenty knights he tumbled from the car while yet he learnd his rudiments of war his venturous spear first drew the heros gore he struck he wounded but he durst no more nor though disarmd patroclus fury stood but swift withdrew the longprotended wood and turnd him short and herded in the crowd thus by an arm divine and mortal spear wounded at once patroclus yields to fear retires for succour to his social train and flies the fate which heaven decreed in vain stern hector as the bleeding chief he views breaks through the ranks and his retreat pursues the lance arrests him with a mortal wound he falls earth thunders and his arms resound with him all greece was sunk that moment all her yetsurviving heroes seemd to fall so scorchd with heat along the desert score the roaming lion meets a bristly boar fast by the spring they both dispute the flood with flaming eyes and jaws besmeard with blood at length the sovereign savage wins the strife and the torn boar resigns his thirst and life patroclus thus so many chiefs oerthrown so many lives effused expires his own as dying now at hectors feet he lies he sternly views him and triumphant cries lie there patroclus and with thee the joy thy pride once promised of subverting troy the fancied scenes of ilion wrapt in flames and thy soft pleasures served with captive dames unthinking man i fought those towers to free and guard that beauteous race from lords like thee but thou a prey to vultures shalt be made thy own achilles cannot lend thee aid though much at parting that great chief might say and much enjoin thee this important day return not my brave friend perhaps he said without the bloody arms of hector dead he spoke patroclus marchd and thus he sped supine and wildly gazing on the skies with faint expiring breath the chief replies vain boaster cease and know the powers divine joves and apollos is this deed not thine to heaven is owed whateer your own you call and heaven itself disarmd me ere my fall had twenty mortals each thy match in might opposed me fairly they had sunk in fight by fate and phbus was i first oerthrown euphorbus next the third mean part thy own but thou imperious hear my latest breath the gods inspire it and it sounds thy death insulting man thou shalt be soon as i black fate oerhangs thee and thy hour draws nigh even now on lifes last verge i see thee stand i see thee fall and by achilles hand he faints the soul unwilling wings her way the beauteous body left a load of clay flits to the lone uncomfortable coast a naked wandering melancholy ghost then hector pausing as his eyes he fed on the pale carcase thus addressd the dead from whence this boding speech the stern decree of death denounced or why denounced to me why not as well achilles fate be given to hectors lance who knows the will of heaven pensive he said then pressing as he lay his breathless bosom tore the lance away and upwards cast the corse the reeking spear he shakes and charges the bold charioteer but swift automedon with loosend reins rapt in the chariot oer the distant plains far from his rage the immortal coursers drove the immortal coursers were the gift of jove illustration sculapius book xvii argument the seventh battle for the body of patroclusthe acts of menelaus menelaus upon the death of patroclus defends his body from the enemy euphorbus who attempts it is slain hector advancing menelaus retires but soon returns with ajax and drives him off this glaucus objects to hector as a flight who thereupon puts on the armour he had won from patroclus and renews the battle the greeks give way till ajax rallies them neas sustains the trojans neas and hector attempt the chariot of achilles which is borne off by automedon the horses of achilles deplore the loss of patroclus jupiter covers his body with a thick darkness the noble prayer of ajax on that occasion menelaus sends antilochus to achilles with the news of patroclus death then returns to the fight where though attacked with the utmost fury he and meriones assisted by the ajaces bear off the body to the ships the time is the evening of the eightandtwentieth day the scene lies in the fields before troy on the cold earth divine patroclus spread lies pierced with wounds among the vulgar dead great menelaus touchd with generous woe springs to the front and guards him from the foe thus round her newfallen young the heifer moves fruit of her throes and firstborn of her loves and anxious helpless as he lies and bare turns and returns her with a mothers care opposed to each that near the carcase came his broad shield glimmers and his lances flame the son of panthus skilld the dart to send eyes the dead hero and insults the friend this hand atrides laid patroclus low warrior desist nor tempt an equal blow to me the spoils my prowess won resign depart with life and leave the glory mine the trojan thus the spartan monarch burnd with generous anguish and in scorn returnd laughst thou not jove from thy superior throne when mortals boast of prowess not their own not thus the lion glories in his might nor panther braves his spotted foe in fight nor thus the boar those terrors of the plain man only vaunts his force and vaunts in vain but far the vainest of the boastful kind these sons of panthus vent their haughty mind yet twas but late beneath my conquering steel this boasters brother hyperenor fell against our arm which rashly he defied vain was his vigour and as vain his pride these eyes beheld him on the dust expire no more to cheer his spouse or glad his sire presumptuous youth like his shall be thy doom go wait thy brother to the stygian gloom or while thou mayst avoid the threatend fate fools stay to feel it and are wise too late unmoved euphorbus thus that action known come for my brothers blood repay thy own his weeping father claims thy destined head and spouse a widow in her bridal bed on these thy conquerd spoils i shall bestow to soothe a consorts and a parents woe no longer then defer the glorious strife let heaven decide our fortune fame and life swift as the word the missile lance he flings the wellaimd weapon on the buckler rings but blunted by the brass innoxious falls on jove the father great atrides calls nor flies the javelin from his arm in vain it pierced his throat and bent him to the plain wide through the neck appears the grisly wound prone sinks the warrior and his arms resound the shining circlets of his golden hair which even the graces might be proud to wear instarrd with gems and gold bestrow the shore with dust dishonourd and deformd with gore as the young olive in some sylvan scene crownd by fresh fountains with eternal green lifts the gay head in snowy flowerets fair and plays and dances to the gentle air when lo a whirlwind from high heaven invades the tender plant and withers all its shades it lies uprooted from its genial bed a lovely ruin now defaced and dead thus young thus beautiful euphorbus lay while the fierce spartan tore his arms away proud of his deed and glorious in the prize affrighted troy the towering victor flies flies as before some mountain lions ire the village curs and trembling swains retire when oer the slaughterd bull they hear him roar and see his jaws distil with smoking gore all pale with fear at distance scatterd round they shout incessant and the vales resound meanwhile apollo viewd with envious eyes and urged great hector to dispute the prize in mentes shape beneath whose martial care the rough ciconians learnd the trade of war forbear he cried with fruitless speed to chase achilles coursers of ethereal race they stoop not these to mortal mans command or stoop to none but great achilles hand too long amused with a pursuit so vain turn and behold the brave euphorbus slain by sparta slain for ever now suppressd the fire which burnd in that undaunted breast thus having spoke apollo wingd his flight and mixd with mortals in the toils of fight his words infixd unutterable care deep in great hectors soul through all the war he darts his anxious eye and instant viewd the breathless hero in his blood imbued forth welling from the wound as prone he lay and in the victors hands the shining prey sheathd in bright arms through cleaving ranks he flies and sends his voice in thunder to the skies fierce as a flood of flame by vulcan sent it flew and fired the nations as it went atrides from the voice the storm divined and thus explored his own unconquerd mind then shall i quit patroclus on the plain slain in my cause and for my honour slain desert the arms the relics of my friend or singly hector and his troops attend sure where such partial favour heaven bestowd to brave the hero were to brave the god forgive me greece if once i quit the field tis not to hector but to heaven i yield yet nor the god nor heaven should give me fear did but the voice of ajax reach my ear still would we turn still battle on the plains and give achilles all that yet remains of his and our patroclus this no more the time allowd troy thickend on the shore a sable scene the terrors hector led slow he recedes and sighing quits the dead so from the fold the unwilling lion parts forced by loud clamours and a storm of darts he flies indeed but threatens as he flies with heart indignant and retorted eyes now enterd in the spartan ranks he turnd his manly breast and with new fury burnd oer all the black battalions sent his view and through the cloud the godlike ajax knew where labouring on the left the warrior stood all grim in arms and coverd oer with blood there breathing courage where the god of day had sunk each heart with terror and dismay to him the king oh ajax oh my friend haste and patroclus loved remains defend the body to achilles to restore demands our care alas we can no more for naked now despoiled of arms he lies and hector glories in the dazzling prize he said and touchd his heart the raging pair pierced the thick battle and provoke the war already had stern hector seized his head and doomd to trojan gods the unhappy dead but soon as ajax reard his towerlike shield sprung to his car and measured back the field his train to troy the radiant armour bear to stand a trophy of his fame in war meanwhile great ajax his broad shield displayd guards the dead hero with the dreadful shade and now before and now behind he stood thus in the centre of some gloomy wood with many a step the lioness surrounds her tawny young beset by men and hounds elate her heart and rousing all her powers dark oer the fiery balls each hanging eyebrow lours fast by his side the generous spartan glows with great revenge and feeds his inward woes but glaucus leader of the lycian aids on hector frowning thus his flight upbraids where now in hector shall we hector find a manly form without a manly mind is this o chief a heros boasted fame how vain without the merit is the name since battle is renounced thy thoughts employ what other methods may preserve thy troy tis time to try if ilions state can stand by thee alone nor ask a foreign hand mean empty boast but shall the lycians stake their lives for you those lycians you forsake what from thy thankless arms can we expect thy friend sarpedon proves thy base neglect say shall our slaughterd bodies guard your walls while unrevengd the great sarpedon falls even where he died for troy you left him there a feast for dogs and all the fowls of air on my command if any lycian wait hence let him march and give up troy to fate did such a spirit as the gods impart impel one trojan hand or trojan heart such as should burn in every soul that draws the sword for glory and his countrys cause even yet our mutual arms we might employ and drag yon carcase to the walls of troy oh were patroclus ours we might obtain sarpedons arms and honourd corse again greece with achilles friend should be repaid and thus due honours purchased to his shade but words are vainlet ajax once appear and hector trembles and recedes with fear thou darst not meet the terrors of his eye and lo already thou preparst to fly the trojan chief with fixd resentment eyed the lycian leader and sedate replied say is it just my friend that hectors ear from such a warrior such a speech should hear i deemd thee once the wisest of thy kind but ill this insult suits a prudent mind i shun great ajax i desert my train tis mine to prove the rash assertion vain i joy to mingle where the battle bleeds and hear the thunder of the sounding steeds but joves high will is ever uncontrolld the strong he withers and confounds the bold now crowns with fame the mighty man and now strikes the fresh garland from the victors brow come through yon squadrons let us hew the way and thou be witness if i fear today if yet a greek the sight of hector dread or yet their hero dare defend the dead then turning to the martial hosts he cries ye trojans

asteropeus with grief beheld the slain and rushd to combat but he rushd in vain indissolubly firm around the dead rank within rank on buckler buckler spread and hemmd with bristled spears the grecians stood a brazen bulwark and an iron wood great ajax eyes them with incessant care and in an orb contracts the crowded war close in their ranks commands to fight or fall and stands the centre and the soul of all fixd on the spot they war and wounded wound a sanguine torrent steeps the reeking ground on heaps the greeks on heaps the trojans bled and thickening round them rise the hills of dead greece in close order and collected might yet suffers least and sways the wavering fight fierce as conflicting fires the combat burns and now it rises now it sinks by turns in one thick darkness all the fight was lost the sun the moon and all the ethereal host seemd as extinct day ravishd from their eyes and all heavens splendours blotted from the skies such oer patroclus body hung the night the rest in sunshine fought and open light unclouded there the aerial azure spread no vapour rested on the mountains head the golden sun pourd forth a stronger ray and all the broad expansion flamed with day dispersed around the plain by fits they fight and here and there their scatterd arrows light but death and darkness oer the carcase spread there burnd the war and there the mighty bled meanwhile the sons of nestor in the rear their fellows routed toss the distant spear and skirmish wide so nestor gave command when from the ships he sent the pylian band the youthful brothers thus for fame contend nor knew the fortune of achilles friend in thought they viewd him still with martial joy glorious in arms and dealing death to troy but round the corse the heroes pant for breath and thick and heavy grows the work of death oerlabourd now with dust and sweat and gore their knees their legs their feet are covered oer drops follow drops the clouds on clouds arise and carnage clogs their hands and darkness fills their eyes as when a slaughterd bulls yet reeking hide straind with full force and tuggd from side to side the brawny curriers stretch and labour oer the extended surface drunk with fat and gore so tugging round the corse both armies stood the mangled body bathed in sweat and blood while greeks and ilians equal strength employ now to the ships to force it now to troy not pallas self her breast when fury warms nor he whose anger sets the world in arms could blame this scene such rage such horror reignd such jove to honour the great dead ordaind achilles in his ships at distance lay nor knew the fatal fortune of the day he yet unconscious of patroclus fall in dust extended under ilions wall expects him glorious from the conquered plain and for his wishd return prepares in vain though well he knew to make proud ilion bend was more than heaven had destined to his friend perhaps to him this thetis had reveald the rest in pity to her son conceald still raged the conflict round the hero dead and heaps on heaps by mutual wounds they bled cursed be the man even private greeks would say who dares desert this welldisputed day first may the cleaving earth before our eyes gape wide and drink our blood for sacrifice first perish all ere haughty troy shall boast we lost patroclus and our glory lost thus they while with one voice the trojans said grant this day jove or heap us on the dead then clash their sounding arms the clangours rise and shake the brazen concave of the skies meantime at distance from the scene of blood the pensive steeds of great achilles stood their godlike master slain before their eyes they wept and shared in human miseries in vain automedon now shakes the rein now plies the lash and soothes and threats in vain nor to the fight nor hellespont they go restive they stood and obstinate in woe still as a tombstone never to be moved on some good man or woman unreproved lays its eternal weight or fixd as stands a marble

with sacred darkness shades the face of all he said and breathing in the immortal horse excessive spirit urged them to the course from their high manes they shake the dust and bear the kindling chariot through the parted war so flies a vulture through the clamorous train of geese that scream and scatter round the plain from danger now with swiftest speed they flew and now to conquest with

alcimedon now greets my eyes no greek like him the heavenly steeds restrains or holds their fury in suspended reins patroclus while he lived their rage could tame but now patroclus is an empty name to thee i yield the seat to thee resign the ruling charge the task of fight be mine he said alcimedon with active heat snatches the reins and vaults into the seat his friend descends the chief of troy

foaming coursers close behind full on my shoulders let their nostrils blow for hard the fight determined is the foe tis hector comes and when he seeks the prize war knows no mean he wins it or he dies then through the field he sends his voice aloud and calls the ajaces from the warring crowd with great atrides hither turn he said turn where distress demands immediate aid the dead encircled by his friends forego and save the living from a fiercer foe unhelpd we stand unequal to engage the force of hector and neas rage yet mighty as they are my force to prove is only mine the event belongs to jove he spoke and high the sounding javelin flung which passd the shield of aretus the young it pierced his belt embossd with curious art then in the lower belly struck the dart as when a ponderous axe descending full cleaves the broad forehead of some brawny bull struck twixt the horns he springs with many a bound then tumbling rolls enormous on the ground thus fell the youth the air his soul received and the spear trembled as his entrails heaved now at automedon the trojan foe discharged his lance the meditated blow stooping he shunnd the javelin idly fled and hissd innoxious oer the heros head deep rooted in the ground the forceful spear in long vibrations spent its fury there with clashing falchions now the chiefs had closed but each brave ajax heard and interposed nor longer hector with his trojans stood but left their slain companion in his blood his arms automedon divests and cries accept patroclus this mean sacrifice thus have i soothed my griefs and thus have paid poor as it is some offering to thy shade so looks the lion oer a mangled boar all grim with rage and horrible with gore high on the chariot at one bound he sprung and oer his seat the bloody trophies hung and now minerva from the realms of air descends impetuous and renews the war for pleased at length the grecian arms to aid the lord of thunders sent the blueeyed maid as when high jove denouncing future woe oer the dark clouds extends his purple bow in sign of tempests from the troubled air or from the rage of man destructive war the drooping cattle dread the impending skies and from his halftilld field the labourer flies in such a form the goddess round her drew a livid cloud and to the battle flew assuming phnix shape on earth she falls and in his wellknown voice to sparta calls and lies achilles friend beloved by all a prey to dogs beneath the trojan wall what shame o greece for future times to tell to thee the greatest in whose cause he fell o chief o father atreus son replies o full of days by long experience wise what more desires my soul than here unmoved to guard the body of the man i loved ah would minerva send me strength to rear this wearied arm and ward the storm of war but hector like the rage of fire we dread and joves own glories blaze around his head pleased to be first of all the powers addressd she breathes new vigour in her heros breast and fills with keen revenge with fell despite desire of blood and rage and lust of fight so burns the vengeful hornet soul all oer repulsed in vain and thirsty still of gore bold son of air and heat on angry wings untamed untired he turns attacks and stings fired with like ardour fierce atrides flew and sent his soul with every lance he threw there stood a trojan not unknown to fame ations son and podes was his

side apollo stood like phaenops asius son appeard the god asius the great who held his wealthy reign in fair abydos by the rolling main oh prince he cried oh foremost once in fame what grecian now shall tremble at thy name dost thou at length to menelaus yield a chief once thought no terror of the field yet singly now the longdisputed prize he bears victorious while our army flies by the same arm illustrious podes bled the friend of hector unrevenged is dead this heard oer hector spreads a cloud of woe rage lifts his lance and drives him on the foe but now the eternal shook his sable shield that shaded ide and all the subject field beneath its ample verge a rolling cloud involved the mount the thunder roard aloud the affrighted hills from their foundations nod and blaze beneath the lightnings of the god at one regard of his allseeing eye the vanquishd triumph and the victors fly then trembled greece the flight peneleus led for as the brave botian turnd his head to face the foe polydamas drew near and razed his shoulder with a shortend spear by hector wounded leitus quits the plain pierced through the wrist and raging with the pain grasps his once formidable lance in vain as hector followd idomen addressd the flaming javelin to his manly breast the brittle point before his corslet yields exulting troy with clamour fills the fields high on his chariots the cretan stood the son of priam whirld the massive wood but erring from its aim the impetuous spear struck to the dust the squire and charioteer of martial merion coeranus his name who left fair lyctus for the fields of fame on foot bold merion fought and now laid low had graced the triumphs of his trojan foe but the brave squire the ready coursers brought and with his life his masters safety bought between his cheek and ear the weapon went the teeth it shatterd and the tongue it rent prone from the seat he tumbles to the plain his dying hand forgets the falling rein this merion reaches bending from the car and urges to desert the hopeless war idomeneus consents the lash applies and the swift chariot to the navy flies not ajax less the will of heaven descried and conquest shifting to the trojan side turnd by the hand of jove then thus begun to atreuss seed the godlike telamon alas who sees not joves almighty hand transfers the glory to the trojan band whether the weak or strong discharge the dart he guides each arrow to a grecian heart not so our spears incessant though they rain he suffers every lance to fall in vain deserted of the god yet let us try what human strength and prudence can supply if yet this honourd corse in triumph borne may glad the fleets that hope not our return who tremble yet scarce rescued from their fates and still hear hector thundering at their gates some hero too must be despatchd to bear the mournful message to pelides ear for sure he knows not distant on the shore his friend his loved patroclus is no more but such a chief i spy not through the host the men the steeds the armies all are lost in general darknesslord of earth and air oh king oh father hear my humble prayer dispel this cloud the light of heaven restore give me to see and ajax asks no more if greece must perish we thy will obey but let us perish in the face of day with tears the hero spoke and at his prayer the god relenting cleard the clouded air forth burst the sun with allenlightening ray the blaze of armour flashd against the day now now atrides cast around thy sight if yet antilochus survives the fight let him to great achilles ear convey the fatal newsatrides hastes away so turns the lion from the nightly fold though high in courage and with hunger bold long galld by herdsmen and long vexd by hounds stiff with fatigue and fretted sore with wounds the darts fly round him from a hundred hands and the red terrors of the blazing brands till late reluctant at the dawn of day sour he departs and quits the untasted prey so moved atrides from his dangerous place with weary limbs but with unwilling pace the foe he feard might yet patroclus gain and much admonishd much adjured his train o guard these relics to your charge consignd and bear the merits of the dead in mind how skilld he was in each obliging art the mildest manners and the gentlest heart he was alas but fate decreed his end in death a hero as in life a friend so parts the chief from rank to rank he flew and round on all sides sent his piercing view as the bold bird endued with sharpest eye of all that wings the mid arial sky the sacred eagle from his walks above looks down and sees the distant thicket move then stoops and sousing on the quivering hare snatches his life amid the clouds of air not with less quickness his exerted sight passd this and that way through the ranks of fight till on the left the chief he sought he found cheering his men and spreading deaths around to him the king beloved of jove draw near for sadder tidings never touchd thy ear thy eyes have witnessd what a fatal turn how ilion triumphs and the achaians mourn this is not all patroclus on the shore now pale and dead shall succour greece no more fly to the fleet this instant fly and tell the sad achilles how his lovedone fell he too may haste the naked corse to gain the arms are hectors who despoild the slain the youthful warrior heard with silent woe from his fair eyes the tears began to flow big with the mighty grief he strove to say what sorrow dictates but no word found way to brave laodocus his arms he flung who near him wheeling drove his steeds along then ran the mournful message to impart with tearful eyes and with dejected heart swift fled the youth nor menelaus stands though sore distressd to aid the pylian bands but bids bold thrasymede those troops sustain himself returns to his patroclus slain gone is antilochus the hero said but hope not warriors for achilles aid though fierce his rage unbounded be his woe unarmd he fights not with the trojan foe tis in our hands alone our hopes remain tis our own vigour must the dead regain and save ourselves while with impetuous hate troy pours along and this way rolls our fate tis well said ajax be it then thy care with merions aid the weighty corse to rear myself and my bold brother will sustain the shock of hector and his charging train nor fear we armies fighting side by side what troy can dare we have already tried have tried it and have stood the hero said high from the ground the warriors heave the dead a general clamour rises at the sight loud shout the trojans and renew the fight not fiercer rush along the gloomy wood with rage insatiate and with thirst of blood voracious hounds that many a length before their furious hunters drive the wounded boar but if the savage turns his glaring eye they howl aloof and round the forest fly thus on retreating greece the trojans pour wave their thick falchions and their javelins shower but ajax turning to their fears they yield all pale they tremble and forsake the field while thus aloft the heros corse they bear behind them rages all the storm of war confusion tumult horror oer the throng of men steeds chariots urged the rout along less fierce the winds with rising flames conspire to whelm some city under waves of fire now sink in gloomy clouds the proud abodes now crack the blazing temples of the gods the rumbling torrent through the ruin rolls and sheets of smoke mount heavy to the poles the heroes sweat beneath their honourd load as when two mules along the rugged road from the steep mountain with exerted strength drag some vast beam or masts unwieldy length inly they groan big drops of sweat distil the enormous timber lumbering down the hill so thesebehind the bulk of ajax stands and breaks the torrent of the rushing bands thus when a river swelld with sudden rains spreads his broad waters oer the level plains some interposing hill the stream divides and breaks its force and turns the winding tides still close they follow close the rear engage neas storms and hector foams with rage while greece a heavy thick retreat maintains wedged in one body like a flight of cranes that shriek incessant while the falcon hung high on poised pinions threats their callow young so from the trojan chiefs the grecians fly such the wild terror and the mingled cry within without the trench and all the way strowd in bright heaps their arms and armour lay such horror jove impressd yet still proceeds the work of death and still the battle bleeds illustration vulcan from an antique gem book xviii argument the grief of achilles and new armour made him by vulcan the news of the death of patroclus is brought to achilles by antilochus thetis hearing his lamentations comes with all her sea nymphs to comfort him the speeches of the mother and son on this occasion iris appears to achilles by the command of juno and orders him to show himself at the head of the intrenchments the sight of him turns the fortunes of the day and the body of patroclus is carried off by the greeks the trojans call a council where hector and polydamas disagree in their opinions but the advice of the former prevails to remain encamped in the field the grief of achilles over the body of patroclus thetis goes to the palace of vulcan to obtain new arms for her son the description of the wonderful works of vulcan and lastly that noble one of the shield of achilles the latter part of the nineandtwentieth day and the night ensuing take up this book the scene is at achilles tent on the seashore from whence it changes to the palace of vulcan thus like the rage of fire the combat burns and now it rises now it sinks by turns meanwhile where hellesponts broad waters flow stood nestors son the messenger of woe there sat achilles shaded by his sails on hoisted yards extended to the gales pensive he sat for all that fate designd rose in sad prospect to his boding mind thus to his soul he said ah what constrains the greeks late victors now to quit the plains is this the day which heaven so long ago ordaind to sink me with the weight of woe so thetis warnd when by a trojan hand the bravest of the myrmidonian band should lose the light fulfilled is that decree fallen is the warrior and patroclus he in vain i charged him soon to quit the plain and warnd to shun hectorean force in vain thus while he thinks antilochus appears and tells the melancholy tale with tears sad tidings son of peleus thou must hear and wretched i the unwilling messenger dead is patroclus for his corse they fight his naked corse his arms are hectors right a sudden horror shot through all the chief and wrappd his senses in the cloud of grief cast on the ground with furious hands he spread the scorching ashes oer his graceful head his purple garments and his golden hairs those he deforms with dust and these he tears on the hard soil his groaning breast he threw and rolld and grovelld as to earth he grew the virgin captives with disorderd charms won by his own or by patroclus arms rushd from their tents with cries and gathering round beat their white breasts and fainted on the ground while nestors son sustains a manlier part and mourns the warrior with a warriors heart hangs on his arms amidst his frantic woe and oft prevents the meditated blow far in the deep abysses of the main with hoary nereus and the watery train the

resignd what banquet but revenge can glad my mind what greater sorrow could afflict my breast what more if hoary peleus were deceased who now perhaps in phthia dreads to hear his sons sad fate and drops a tender tear what more should neoptolemus the brave my only offspring sink into the grave if yet that offspring lives i distant far of all neglectful wage a hateful war i could not this this cruel stroke attend fate claimd achilles but might spare his friend i hoped patroclus might survive to rear my tender orphan with a parents care from scyros isle conduct him oer the main and glad his eyes with his paternal reign the lofty palace and the large domain for peleus breathes no more the vital air or drags a wretched life of age and care but till the news of my sad fate invades his hastening soul and sinks him to the shades sighing he said his grief the heroes joind each stole a tear for what he left behind their mingled grief the sire of heaven surveyd and thus with pity to his blueeyed maid is then achilles now no more thy care and dost thou thus desert the great in war lo where yon sails their canvas wings extend all comfortless he sits and wails his friend ere thirst and want his forces have oppressd haste and infuse ambrosia in his breast he spoke and sudden at the word of jove shot the descending goddess from above so swift through ether the shrill harpy springs the

abodes now issued from the ships the warriortrain and like a deluge pourd upon the plain as when the piercing blasts of boreas blow and scatter oer the fields the driving snow from dusky clouds the fleecy winter flies whose dazzling lustre whitens all the skies so helms succeeding helms so shields from shields catch the quick beams and brighten all the fields broad glittering breastplates spears with pointed rays mix in one stream reflecting blaze on blaze thick beats the centre as the coursers bound with splendour flame the skies and laugh the fields around full in the midst hightowering oer the rest his limbs in arms divine achilles dressd arms which the father of the fire bestowd forged on the eternal anvils of the god grief and revenge his furious heart inspire his glowing eyeballs roll with living fire he grinds his teeth and furious with delay oerlooks the embattled host and hopes the bloody day the silver cuishes first his thighs infold then oer his breast was braced the hollow gold the brazen sword a various baldric tied that starrd with gems hung glittering at his side and like the moon the broad refulgent shield blazed with long rays and gleamd athwart the field so to nightwandering sailors pale with fears wide oer the watery waste a light appears which on the farseen mountain blazing high streams from some lonely watchtower to the sky with mournful eyes they gaze and gaze again loud howls the storm and drives them oer the main next his high head the helmet graced behind the sweepy crest hung floating in the wind like the red star that from his flaming hair shakes down diseases pestilence and war so streamd the golden honours from his head trembled the sparkling plumes and the loose glories shed the chief beholds himself with wondering eyes his arms he poises and his motions tries buoyd by some inward force he seems to swim and feels a pinion lifting every limb and now he shakes his great paternal spear ponderous and huge which not a greek could rear from pelions cloudy top an ash entire old chiron felld and shaped it for his sire a spear which stern achilles only wields the death of heroes and the dread of fields automedon and alcimus prepare the immortal coursers and the radiant car the silver traces sweeping at their side their fiery mouths resplendent bridles tied the ivorystudded reins returnd behind waved oer their backs and to the chariot joind the charioteer then whirld the lash around and swift ascended at one active bound all bright in heavenly arms above his squire achilles mounts and sets the field on fire not brighter phbus in the ethereal way flames from his chariot and restores the day high oer the host all terrible he stands and thunders to his steeds these dread commands xanthus and balius of podarges strain unless ye boast that heavenly race in vain be swift be mindful of the load ye bear and learn to make your master more your care through falling squadrons bear my slaughtering sword nor as ye left patroclus leave your lord the generous xanthus as the words he said seemd sensible of woe and droopd his head trembling he stood before the golden wain and bowd to dust the honours of his mane when strange to tell so juno willd he broke eternal silence and portentous spoke achilles yes this day at least we bear thy rage in safety through the files of war but come it will the fatal time must come not ours the fault but god decrees thy doom not through our crime or slowness in the course fell thy patroclus but by heavenly force the bright farshooting god who gilds the day confessd we saw him tore his arms away nocould our swiftness oer the winds prevail or beat the pinions of the western gale all were in vainthe fates thy death demand due to a mortal and immortal hand then ceased for ever by the furies tied his fateful voice the intrepid chief replied with unabated rageso let it be portents and prodigies are lost on me i know my fate to die to see no more my muchloved parents and my native shore enoughwhen heaven ordains i sink in night now perish troy he said and rushd to fight illustration hercules book xx argument the battle of the gods and the acts of achilles jupiter upon achilles return to the battle calls a council of the gods and permits them to assist either party the terrors of the combat described when the deities are engaged apollo encourages neas to meet achilles after a long conversation these two heroes encounter but neas is preserved by the assistance of neptune achilles falls upon the rest of the trojans and is upon the point of killing hector but apollo conveys him away in a cloud achilles pursues the trojans with a great slaughter the same day continues the scene is in the field before troy thus round pelides breathing war and blood greece sheathed in arms beside her vessels stood while near impending from a neighbouring height troys black battalions wait the shock of fight then jove to themis gives command to call the gods to council in the starry hall swift oer olympus hundred hills she flies and summons all the senate of the skies these shining on in long procession come to joves eternal adamantine dome not one was absent not a rural power that haunts the verdant gloom or rosy bower each fairhaird dryad of the shady wood each azure sister of the silver flood all but old ocean hoary sire who keeps his ancient seat beneath the sacred deeps on marble thrones with lucid columns crownd the work of vulcan sat the powers around even he whose trident sways the watery reign heard the loud summons and forsook the main assumed his throne amid the bright abodes and questiond thus the sire of men and gods what moves the god who heaven and earth commands and grasps the thunder in his awful hands thus to convene the whole ethereal state is greece and troy the subject in debate already met the louring hosts appear and death stands ardent on the edge of war tis true the cloudcompelling power replies this day we call the council of the skies in care of human race even joves own eye sees with regret unhappy mortals die far on olympus top in secret state ourself will sit and see the hand of fate work out our will celestial powers descend and as your minds direct your succour lend to either host troy soon must lie oerthrown if uncontrolld achilles fights alone their troops but lately durst not meet his eyes what can they now if in his rage he rise assist them gods or ilions sacred wall may fall this day though fate forbids the fall he said and fired their heavenly breasts with rage on adverse parts the warring gods engage heavens awful queen and he whose azure round girds the vast globe the maid in arms renownd hermes of profitable arts the sire and vulcan the black sovereign of the fire these to the fleet repair with instant flight the vessels tremble as the gods alight in aid of troy latona phbus came mars fieryhelmd the laughterloving dame xanthus whose streams in golden currents flow and the chaste huntress of the silver bow ere yet the gods their various aid employ each argive bosom swelld with manly joy while great achilles terror of the plain long lost to battle shone in arms again dreadful he stood in front of all his host pale troy beheld and seemd already lost her bravest heroes pant with inward fear and trembling see another god of war but when the powers descending swelld the fight then tumult rose fierce rage and pale affright varied each face then discord sounds alarms earth echoes and the nations rush to arms now through the trembling shores minerva calls and now she thunders from the grecian walls mars hovering oer his troy his terror shrouds in gloomy tempests and a night of clouds now through each trojan heart he fury pours with voice divine from ilions topmost towers now shouts to simois from her beauteous hill the mountain shook the rapid stream stood still above the sire of gods his thunder rolls and peals on peals redoubled rend the poles beneath stern neptune shakes the solid ground the forests wave the mountains nod around through all their summits tremble idas woods and from their sources boil her hundred floods troys turrets totter on the rocking plain and the tossd navies beat the heaving main deep in the dismal regions of the dead the infernal monarch reard his horrid head leapd from his throne lest neptunes arm should lay his dark dominions open to the day and pour in light on plutos drear abodes abhorrd by men and dreadful even to gods illustration the gods descending to battle such war the immortals wage such horrors rend the worlds vast concave when the gods contend first silvershafted phbus took the plain against blue neptune monarch of the main the god of arms his giant bulk displayd opposed to pallas wars triumphant maid against latona marchd the son of may the quiverd dian sister of the day her golden arrows sounding at her side saturnia majesty of heaven defied with fiery vulcan last in battle stands the sacred flood that rolls on golden sands xanthus his name with those of heavenly birth but called scamander by the sons of earth while thus the gods in various league engage achilles glowd with more than mortal rage hector he sought in search of hector turnd his eyes around for hector only burnd and burst like lightning through the ranks and vowd to glut the god of battles with his blood neas was the first who dared to stay apollo wedged him in the warriors way but swelld his bosom with undaunted might halfforced and halfpersuaded to the fight like young lycaon of the royal line in voice and aspect seemd the power divine and bade the chief reflect how late with scorn in distant threats he braved the goddessborn then thus the hero of anchises strain to meet pelides you persuade in vain already have i met nor void of fear observed the fury of his flying spear from idas woods he chased us to the field our force he scattered and our herds he killd lyrnessus pedasus in ashes lay but jove assisting i survived the day else had i sunk oppressd in fatal fight by fierce achilles and minervas might whereer he moved the goddess shone before and bathed his brazen lance in hostile gore what mortal man achilles can sustain the immortals guard him through the dreadful plain and suffer not his dart to fall in vain were god my aid this arm should check his power though strong in battle as a brazen tower to whom the son of jove that god implore and be what great achilles was before from heavenly venus thou derivst thy strain and he but from a sister of the main an aged seagod father of his line but jove himself the sacred source of thine then lift thy weapon for a noble blow nor fear the vaunting of a mortal foe this said and spirit breathed into his breast through the thick troops the emboldend hero pressd his venturous act the whitearmd queen surveyd and thus assembling all the powers she said behold an action gods that claims your care lo great neas rushing to the war against pelides he directs his course phbus impels and phbus gives him force restrain his bold career at least to attend our favourd hero let some power descend to guard his life and add to his renown we the great armament of heaven came down hereafter let him fall as fates design that spun so short his lifes illustrious line but lest some adverse god now cross his way give him to know what powers assist this day for how shall mortal stand the dire alarms when heavens refulgent host appear in arms thus she and thus the god whose force can make the solid globes eternal basis shake against the might of man so feeble known why should celestial powers exert their own suffice from yonder mount to view the scene and leave to war the fates of mortal men but if the armipotent or god of light obstruct achilles or commence the fight thence on the gods of troy we swift descend full soon i doubt not shall the conflict end and these in ruin and confusion hurld yield to our conquering arms the lower world thus having said the tyrant of the sea coerulean neptune rose and led the way advanced upon the field there stood a mound of earth congested walld and trenchd around in elder times to guard alcides made the work of trojans with minervas aid what time a vengeful monster of the main swept the wide shore and drove him to the plain here neptune and the gods of greece repair with clouds encompassd and a veil of air the adverse powers around apollo laid crown the fair hills that silver simois shade in circle close each heavenly party sat intent to form the future scheme of fate but mix not yet in fight though jove on high gives the loud signal and the heavens reply meanwhile the rushing armies hide the ground the trampled centre yields a hollow sound steeds cased in mail and chiefs in armour bright the gleaming champaign glows with brazen light amid both hosts a dreadful space appear there great achilles bold neas here with towering strides neas first advanced the nodding plumage on his helmet danced spread oer his breast the fencing shield he bore and so he moved his javelin flamed before not so pelides furious to engage he rushd impetuous such the lions rage who viewing first his foes with scornful eyes though all in arms the peopled city rise stalks careless on with unregarding pride till at the length by some brave youth defied to his bold spear the savage turns alone he murmurs fury with a hollow groan he grins he foams he rolls his eyes around lashd by his tail his heaving sides resound he calls up all his rage he grinds his teeth resolved on vengeance or resolved on death so fierce achilles on neas flies so stands neas and his force defies ere yet the stern encounter joind begun the seed of thetis thus to venus son why comes neas through the ranks so far seeks he to meet achilles arm in war in hope the realms of priam to enjoy and prove his merits to the throne of troy grant that beneath thy lance achilles dies the partial monarch may refuse the prize sons he has many those thy pride may quell and tis his fault to love those sons too well or in reward of thy victorious hand has troy proposed some spacious tract of land an ample forest or a fair domain of hills for vines and arable for grain even this perhaps will hardly prove thy lot but can achilles be so soon forgot once as i think you saw this brandishd spear and then the great neas seemd to fear with hearty haste from idas mount he fled nor till he reachd lyrnessus turnd his head her lofty walls not long our progress stayd those pallas jove and we in ruins laid in grecian chains her captive race were cast tis true the great neas fled too fast defrauded of my conquest once before what then i lost the gods this day restore go while thou mayst avoid the threatend fate fools stay to feel it and are wise too late to this anchises son such words employ to one that fears thee some unwarlike boy such we disdain the best may be defied with mean reproaches and unmanly pride unworthy the high race from which we came proclaimd so loudly by the voice of fame each from illustrious fathers draws his line each goddessborn half human half divine thetis this day or venus offspring dies and tears shall trickle from celestial eyes for when two heroes thus derived contend tis not in words the glorious strife can end if yet thou further seek to learn my birth a tale resounded through the spacious earth hear how the glorious origin we prove from ancient dardanus the first from jove dardanias walls he raised for ilion then the city since of manylanguaged men was not the natives were content to till the shady foot of idas fountful hill from dardanus great erichthonius springs the richest once of asias wealthy kings three thousand mares his spacious pastures bred three thousand foals beside their mothers fed boreas enamourd of the sprightly train conceald his godhead in a flowing mane with voice dissembled to his loves he neighd and coursed the dappled beauties oer the mead hence sprung twelve others of unrivalld kind swift as their mother mares and father wind these lightly skimming when they swept the plain nor plied the grass nor bent the tender grain and when along the level seas they flew scarce on the surface curld the briny dew such erichthonius was from him there came the sacred tros of whom the trojan name three sons renownd adornd his nuptial bed ilus assaracus and ganymed the matchless ganymed divinely fair whom heaven enamourd snatchd to upper air to bear the cup of jove ethereal guest the grace and glory of the ambrosial feast the two remaining sons the line divide first rose laomedon from ilus side from him tithonus now in cares grown old and priam blessd with hector brave and bold clytius and lampus everhonourd pair and hicetaon thunderbolt of war from great assaracus sprang capys he begat anchises and anchises me such is our race tis fortune gives us birth but jove alone endues the soul with worth he source of power and might with boundless sway all human courage gives or takes away long in the field of words we may contend reproach is infinite and knows no end armd or with truth or falsehood right or wrong so voluble a weapon is the tongue wounded we wound and neither side can fail for every man has equal strength to rail women alone when in the streets they jar perhaps excel us in this wordy war like us they stand encompassd with the crowd and vent their anger impotent and loud cease thenour business in the field of fight is not to question but to prove our might to all those insults thou hast offerd here receive this answer tis my flying spear he spoke with all his force the javelin flung fixd deep and loudly in the buckler rung far on his outstretchd arm pelides held to meet the thundering lance his dreadful shield that trembled as it stuck nor void of fear saw ere it fell the immeasurable spear his fears were vain impenetrable charms secured the temper of the ethereal arms through two strong plates the point its passage held but stoppd and rested by the third repelld five plates of various metal various mould composed the shield of brass each outward fold of tin each inward and the middle gold there stuck the lance then rising ere he threw the forceful spear of great achilles flew and pierced the dardan shields extremest bound where the shrill brass returnd a sharper sound through the thin verge the pelean weapon glides and the slight covering of expanded hides neas his contracted body bends and oer him high the riven targe extends sees through its parting plates the upper air and at his back perceives the quivering spear a fate so near him chills his soul with fright and swims before his eyes the manycolourd light achilles rushing in with dreadful cries draws his broad blade and at neas flies neas rousing as the foe came on with force collected heaves a mighty stone a mass enormous which in modern days no two of earths degenerate sons could raise but oceans god whose earthquakes rock the ground saw the distress and moved the powers around lo on the brink of fate neas stands an instant victim to achilles hands by phbus urged but phbus has bestowd his aid in vain the man oerpowers the god and can ye see this righteous chief atone with guiltless blood for vices not his own to all the gods his constant vows were paid sure though he wars for troy he claims our aid fate wills not this nor thus can jove resign the future father of the dardan line the first great ancestor obtaind his grace and still his love descends on all the race for priam now and priams faithless kind at length are odious to the allseeing mind on great neas shall devolve the reign and sons succeeding sons the lasting line sustain the great earthshaker thus to whom replies the imperial goddess with the radiant eyes good as he is to immolate or spare the dardan prince o neptune be thy care pallas and i by all that gods can bind have sworn destruction to the trojan kind not even an instant to protract their fate or save one member of the sinking state till her last flame be quenchd with her last gore and even her crumbling ruins are no more the king of ocean to the fight descends through all the whistling darts his course he bends swift interposed between the warrior flies and casts thick darkness oer achilles eyes from great neas shield the spear he drew and at his masters feet the weapon threw that done with force divine he snatchd on high the dardan prince and bore him through the sky smoothgliding without step above the heads of warring heroes and of bounding steeds till at the battles utmost verge they light where the slow caucans close the rear of fight the godhead there his heavenly form confessd with words like these the panting chief addressd what power o prince with force inferior far urged thee to meet achilles arm in war henceforth beware nor antedate thy doom defrauding fate of all thy fame to come but when the day decreed for come it must shall lay this dreadful hero in the dust let then the furies of that arm be known secure no grecian force transcends thy own with that he left him wondering as he lay then from achilles chased the mist away sudden returning with a stream of light the scene of war came rushing on his sight then thus amazed what wonders strike my mind my spear that parted on the wings of wind laid here before me and the dardan lord that fell this instant vanishd from my sword i thought alone with mortals to contend but powers celestial sure this foe defend great as he is our arms he scarce will try content for once with all his gods to fly now then let others bleed this said aloud he vents his fury and inflames the crowd o greeks he cries and every rank alarms join battle man to man and arms to arms tis not in me though favourd by the sky to mow whole troops and make whole armies fly no god can singly such a host engage not mars himself nor great minervas rage but whatsoeer achilles can inspire whateer of active force or acting fire whateer this heart can prompt or hand obey all all achilles greeks is yours today through yon wide host this arm shall scatter fear and thin the squadrons with my single spear he said nor less elate with martial joy the godlike hector warmd the troops of troy trojans to war think hector leads you on nor dread the vaunts of peleus haughty son deeds must decide our fate een these with words insult the brave who tremble at their swords the weakest atheistwretch all heaven defies but shrinks and shudders when the thunder flies nor from yon boaster shall your chief retire not though his heart were steel his hands were fire that fire that steel your hector should withstand and brave that vengeful heart that dreadful hand thus breathing rage through all the hero said a wood of lances rises round his head clamours on clamours tempest all the air they join they throng they thicken to the war but phbus warns him from high heaven to shun the single fight with thetis godlike son more safe to combat in the mingled band nor tempt too near the terrors of his hand he hears obedient to the god of light and plunged within the ranks awaits the fight then fierce achilles shouting to the skies on troys whole force with boundless fury flies first falls iphytion at his armys head brave was the chief and brave the host he led from great otrynteus he derived his blood his mother was a nais of the flood beneath the shades of tmolus crownd with snow from hydes walls he ruled the lands below fierce as he springs the sword his head divides the parted visage falls on equal sides with loudresounding arms he strikes the plain while thus achilles glories oer the slain lie there otryntides the trojan earth receives thee dead though gygae boast thy birth those beauteous fields where hyllus waves are rolld and plenteous hermus swells with tides of gold are thine no morethe insulting hero said and left him sleeping in eternal shade the rolling wheels of greece the body tore and dashd their axles with no vulgar gore demoleon next antenors offspring laid breathless in dust the price of rashness paid the impatient steel with fulldescending sway forced through his brazen helm its furious way resistless drove the batterd skull before and dashd and mingled all the brains with gore this sees hippodamas and seized with fright deserts his chariot for a swifter flight the lance arrests him an ignoble wound the panting trojan rivets to the ground he groans away his soul not louder roars at neptunes shrine on helics high shores the victim bull the rocks rebellow round and ocean listens to the grateful sound then fell on polydore his vengeful rage the youngest hope of priams stooping age whose feet for swiftness in the race surpassd of all his sons the dearest and the last to the forbidden field he takes his flight in the first folly of a youthful knight to vaunt his swiftness wheels around the plain but vaunts not long with all his swiftness slain struck where the crossing belts unite behind and golden rings the double backplate joind forth through the navel burst the thrilling steel and on his knees with piercing shrieks he fell the rushing entrails pourd upon the ground his hands collect and darkness wraps him round when hector viewd all ghastly in his gore thus sadly slain the unhappy polydore a cloud of sorrow overcast his sight his soul no longer brookd the distant fight full in achilles dreadful front he came and shook his javelin like a waving flame the son of peleus sees with joy possessd his heart highbounding in his rising breast and lo the man on whom black fates attend the man that slew achilles is his friend no more shall hectors and pelides spear turn from each other in the walks of war then with revengeful eyes he scannd him oer come and receive thy fate he spake no more hector undaunted thus such words employ to one that dreads thee some unwarlike boy such we could give defying and defied mean intercourse of obloquy and pride i know thy force to mine superior far but heaven alone confers success in war mean as i am the gods may guide my dart and give it entrance in a braver heart then parts the lance but pallas heavenly breath far from achilles wafts the winged death the bidden dart again to hector flies and at the feet of its great master lies achilles closes with his hated foe his heart and eyes with flaming fury glow but present to his aid apollo shrouds the favourd hero in a veil of clouds thrice struck pelides with indignant heart thrice in impassive air he plunged the dart the spear a fourth time buried in the cloud he foams with fury and exclaims aloud wretch thou hast scaped again once more thy flight has saved thee and the partial god of light but long thou shalt not thy just fate withstand if any power assist achilles hand fly then inglorious but thy flight this day whole hecatombs of trojan ghosts shall pay with that he gluts his rage on numbers slain then dryops tumbled to the ensanguined plain pierced through the neck he left him panting there and stoppd demuchus great philetors heir gigantic chief deep gashd the enormous blade and for the soul an ample passage made laoganus and dardanus expire the valiant sons of an unhappy sire both in one instant from the chariot hurld sunk in one instant to the nether world this difference only their sad fates afford that one the spear destroyd and one the sword nor less unpitied young alastor bleeds in vain his youth in vain his beauty pleads in vain he begs thee with a suppliants moan to spare a form an age so like thy own unhappy boy no prayer no moving art eer bent that fierce inexorable heart while yet he trembled at his knees and cried the ruthless falchion oped his tender side the panting liver pours a flood of gore that drowns his bosom till he pants no more through mulius head then drove the impetuous spear the warrior falls transfixd from ear to ear thy life echeclus next the sword bereaves deep though the front the ponderous falchion cleaves warmd in the brain the smoking weapon lies the purple death comes floating oer his eyes then brave deucalion died the dart was flung where the knit nerves the pliant elbow strung he droppd his arm an unassisting weight and stood all impotent expecting fate full on his neck the falling falchion sped from his broad shoulders hewd his crested head forth from the bone the spinal marrow flies and sunk in dust the corpse extended lies rhigmas whose race from fruitful thracia came the son of pierus an illustrious name succeeds to fate the spear his belly rends prone from his car the thundering chief descends the squire who saw expiring on the ground his prostrate master reind the steeds around his back scarce turnd the pelian javelin gored and stretchd the servant oer his dying lord as when a flame the winding valley fills and runs on crackling shrubs between the hills then oer the stubble up the mountain flies fires the high woods and blazes to the skies this way and that the spreading torrent roars so sweeps the hero through the wasted shores around him wide immense destruction pours and earth is deluged with the sanguine showers as with autumnal harvests coverd oer and thick bestrewn lies ceres sacred floor when round and round with neverwearied pain the trampling steers beat out the unnumberd grain so the fierce coursers as the chariot rolls tread down whole ranks and crush out heroes souls dashd from their hoofs while oer the dead they fly black bloody drops the smoking chariot dye the spiky wheels through heaps of carnage tore and thick the groaning axles droppd with gore high oer the scene of death achilles stood all grim with dust all horrible in blood yet still insatiate still with rage on flame such is the lust of neverdying fame illustration centaur book xxi argument the battle in the river scamander the trojans fly before achilles some towards the town others to the river scamander he falls upon the latter with great slaughter takes twelve captives alive to sacrifice to the shade of patroclus and kills lycaon and asteropeus scamander attacks him with all his waves neptune and pallas assist the hero simois joins scamander at length vulcan by the instigation of juno almost dries up the river this combat ended the other gods engage each other meanwhile achilles continues the slaughter drives the rest into troy agenor only makes a stand and is conveyed away in a cloud by apollo who to delude achilles takes upon him agenors shape and while he pursues him in that disguise gives the trojans an opportunity of retiring into their city the same day continues the scene is on the banks and in the stream of scamander and now to xanthus gliding stream they drove xanthus immortal progeny of jove the river here divides the flying train part to the town fly diverse oer the plain where late their troops triumphant bore the fight now chased and trembling in ignoble flight these with a gathered mist saturnia shrouds and rolls behind the rout a heap of clouds part plunge into the stream old xanthus roars the flashing billows beat the whitend shores with cries promiscuous all the banks resound and here and there in eddies whirling round the flouncing steeds and shrieking warriors drownd as the scorchd locusts from their fields retire while fast behind them runs the blaze of fire driven from the land before the smoky cloud the clustering legions rush into the flood so plunged in xanthus by achilles force roars the resounding surge with men and horse his bloody lance the hero casts aside which spreading tamarisks on the margin hide then like a god the rapid billows braves armd with his sword high brandishd oer the waves now down he plunges now he whirls it round deep groand the waters with the dying sound repeated wounds the reddening river dyed and the warm purple circled on the tide swift through the foamy flood the trojans fly and close in rocks or winding caverns lie so the huge dolphin tempesting the main in shoals before him fly the scaly train confusedly heapd they seek their inmost caves or pant and heave beneath the floating waves now tired with slaughter from the trojan band twelve chosen youths he drags alive to land with their rich belts their captive arms restrains late their proud ornaments but now their chains these his attendants to the ships conveyd sad victims destined to patroclus shade then as once more he plunged amid the flood the young lycaon in his passage stood the son of priam whom the heros hand but late made captive in his fathers land as from a sycamore his sounding steel loppd the green arms to spoke a chariot wheel to lemnos isle he sold the royal slave where jasons son the price demanded gave but kind eetion touching on the shore the ransomd prince to fair arisbe bore ten days were past since in his fathers reign he felt the sweets of liberty again the next that god whom men in vain withstand gives the same youth to the same conquering hand now never to return and doomd to go a sadder journey to the shades below his wellknown face when great achilles eyed the helm and visor he had cast aside with wild affright and droppd upon the field his useless lance and unavailing shield as trembling panting from the stream he fled and knockd his faltering knees the hero said ye mighty gods what wonders strike my view is it in vain our conquering arms subdue sure i shall see yon heaps of trojans killd rise from the shades and brave me on the field as now the captive whom so late i bound and sold to lemnos stalks on trojan ground not him the seas unmeasured deeps detain that bar such numbers from their native plain lo he returns try then my flying spear try if the grave can hold the wanderer if earth at length this active prince can seize earth whose strong grasp has held down hercules thus while he spoke the trojan pale with fears approachd and sought his knees with suppliant tears loth as he was to yield his youthful breath and his soul shivering at the approach of death achilles raised the spear prepared to wound he kissd his feet extended on the ground and while above the spear suspended stood longing to dip its thirsty point in blood one hand embraced them close one stoppd the dart while thus these melting words attempt his heart thy wellknown captive great achilles see once more lycaon trembles at thy knee some pity to a suppliants name afford who shared the gifts of ceres at thy board whom late thy conquering arm to lemnos bore far from his father friends and native shore a hundred oxen were his price that day now sums immense thy mercy shall repay scarce respited from woes i yet appear and scarce twelve morning suns have seen me here lo jove again submits me to thy hands again her victim cruel fate demands i sprang from priam and laothoe fair old altes daughter and lelegias heir who held in pedasus his famed abode and ruled the fields where silver satnio flowd two sons alas unhappy sons she bore for ah one spear shall drink each brothers gore and i succeed to slaughterd polydore how from that arm of terror shall i fly some demon urges tis my doom to die if ever yet soft pity touchd thy mind ah think not me too much of hectors kind not the same mother gave thy suppliant breath with his who wrought thy loved patroclus death these words attended with a shower of tears the youth addressd to unrelenting ears talk not of life or ransom he replies patroclus dead whoever meets me dies in vain a single trojan sues for grace but least the sons of priams hateful race die then my friend what boots it to deplore the great the good patroclus is no more he far thy better was foredoomd to die and thou dost thou bewail mortality seest thou not me whom natures gifts adorn sprung from a hero from a goddess born the day shall come which nothing can avert when by the spear the arrow or the dart by night or day by force or by design impending death and certain fate are mine die thenhe said and as the word he spoke the fainting stripling sank before the stroke his hand forgot its grasp and left the spear while all his trembling frame confessd his fear sudden achilles his broad sword displayd and buried in his neck the reeking blade prone fell the youth and panting on the land the gushing purple dyed the thirsty sand the victor to the stream the carcase gave and thus insults him floating on the wave lie there lycaon let the fish surround thy bloated corpse and suck thy gory wound there no sad mother shall thy funerals weep but swift scamander roll thee to the deep whose every wave some watery monster brings to feast unpunishd on the fat of kings so perish troy and all the trojan line such ruin theirs and such compassion mine what boots ye now scamanders worshippd stream his earthly honours and immortal name in vain your immolated bulls are slain your living coursers glut his gulfs in vain thus he rewards you with this bitter fate thus till the grecian vengeance is complete thus is atoned patroclus honourd shade and the short absence of achilles paid these boastful words provoked the raging god with fury swells the violated flood what means divine may yet the power employ to check achilles and to rescue troy meanwhile the hero springs in arms to dare the great asteropeus to mortal war the son of pelagon whose lofty line flows from the source of axius stream divine fair peribaeas love the god had crownd with all his refluent waters circled round on him achilles rushd he fearless stood and shook two spears advancing from the flood the flood impelld him on pelides head to avenge his waters choked with heaps of dead near as they drew achilles thus began what art thou boldest of the race of man who or from whence unhappy is the sire whose son encounters our resistless ire o son of peleus what avails to trace replied the warrior our illustrious race from rich paeonias valleys i command armd with protended spears my native band now shines the tenth bright morning since i came in aid of ilion to the fields of fame axius who swells with all the neighbouring rills and wide around the floated region fills begot my sire whose spear much glory won now lift thy arm and try that heros son threatening he said the hostile chiefs advance at once asteropeus discharged each lance for both his dexterous hands the lance could wield one struck but pierced not the vulcanian shield one razed achilles hand the spouting blood spun forth in earth the fastend weapon stood like lightning next the pelean javelin flies its erring fury hissd along the skies deep in the swelling bank was driven the spear even to the middle earth and quiverd there then from his side the sword pelides drew and on his foe with double fury flew the foe thrice tuggd and shook the rooted wood repulsive of his might the weapon stood the fourth he tries to break the spear in vain bent as he stands he tumbles to the plain his belly opend with a ghastly wound the reeking entrails pour upon the ground beneath the heros feet he panting lies and his eye darkens and his spirit flies while the proud victor thus triumphing said his radiant armour tearing from the dead so ends thy glory such the fate they prove who strive presumptuous with the sons of jove sprung from a river didst thou boast thy line but great saturnius is the source of mine how durst thou vaunt thy watery progeny of peleus acus and jove am i the race of these superior far to those as he that thunders to the stream that flows what rivers can scamander might have shown but jove he dreads nor wars against his son even achelous might contend in vain and all the roaring billows of the main the eternal ocean from whose fountains flow the seas the rivers and the springs below the thundering voice of jove abhors to hear and in his deep abysses shakes with fear he said then from the bank his javelin tore and left the breathless warrior in his gore the floating tides the bloody carcase lave and beat against it wave succeeding wave till rolld between the banks it lies the food of curling eels and fishes of the flood all scatterd round the stream their mightiest slain the amazed ponians scour along the plain he vents his fury on the flying crew thrasius astyplus and mnesus slew mydon thersilochus with nius fell and numbers more his lance had plunged to hell but from the bottom of his gulfs profound scamander spoke the shores returnd the sound o first of mortals for the gods are thine in valour matchless and in force divine if jove have given thee every trojan head tis not on me thy rage should heap the dead see my choked streams no more their course can keep nor roll their wonted tribute to the deep turn then impetuous from our injured flood content thy slaughters could amaze a god in human form confessd before his eyes the river thus and thus the chief replies o sacred stream thy word we shall obey but not till troy the destined vengeance pay not till within her towers the perjured train shall pant and tremble at our arms again not till proud hector guardian of her wall or stain this lance or see achilles fall he said and drove with fury on the foe then to the godhead of the silver bow the yellow flood began o son of jove was not the mandate of the sire above full and express that phbus should employ his sacred arrows in defence of troy and make her conquer till hyperions fall in awful darkness hide the face of all he spoke in vainthe chief without dismay ploughs through the boiling surge his desperate way then rising in his rage above the shores from all his deep the bellowing river roars huge heaps of slain disgorges on the coast and round the banks the ghastly dead are tossd while all before the billows ranged on high a watery bulwark screen the bands who fly now bursting on his head with thundering sound the falling deluge whelms the hero round his loaded shield bends to the rushing tide his feet upborne scarce the strong flood divide sliddering and staggering on the border stood a spreading elm that overhung the flood he seized a bending bough his steps to stay the plant uprooted to his weight gave way heaving the bank and undermining all loud flash the waters to the rushing fall of the thick foliage the large trunk displayd bridged the rough flood across the hero stayd on this his weight and raised upon his hand leapd from the channel and regaind the land then blackend the wild waves the murmur rose the god pursues a huger billow throws and bursts the bank ambitious to destroy the man whose fury is the fate of troy he like the warlike eagle speeds his pace swiftest and strongest of the aerial race far as a spear can fly achilles springs at every bound his clanging armour rings now here now there he turns on every side and winds his course before the following tide the waves flow after wheresoeer he wheels and gather fast and murmur at his heels so when a peasant to his garden brings soft rills of water from the bubbling springs and calls the floods from high to bless his bowers and feed with pregnant streams the plants and flowers soon as he clears whateer their passage stayd and marks the future current with his spade swift oer the rolling pebbles down the hills louder and louder purl the falling rills before him scattering they prevent his pains and shine in mazy wanderings oer the plains still flies achilles but before his eyes still swift scamander rolls whereer he flies not all his speed escapes the rapid floods the first of men but not a match for gods oft as he turnd the torrent to oppose and bravely try if all the powers were foes so oft the surge in watery mountains spread beats on his back or bursts upon his head yet dauntless still the adverse flood he braves and still indignant bounds above the waves tired by the tides his knees relax with toil washd from beneath him slides the slimy soil when thus his eyes on heavens expansion thrown forth bursts the hero with an angry groan is there no god achilles to befriend no power to avert his miserable end prevent o jove this ignominious date and make my future life the sport of fate of all heavens oracles believed in vain but most of thetis must her son complain by phbus darts she prophesied my fall in glorious arms before the trojan wall oh had i died in fields of battle warm stretchd like a hero by a heros arm might hectors spear this dauntless bosom rend and my swift soul oertake my slaughterd friend ah no achilles meets a shameful fate oh how unworthy of the brave and great like some vile swain whom on a rainy day crossing a ford the torrent sweeps away an unregarded carcase to the sea neptune and pallas haste to his relief and thus in human form addressd the chief the power of ocean first forbear thy fear o son of peleus lo thy gods appear behold from jove descending to thy aid propitious neptune and the blueeyed maid stay and the furious flood shall cease to rave tis not thy fate to glut his angry wave but thou the counsel heaven suggests attend nor breathe from combat nor thy sword suspend till troy receive her flying sons till all her routed squadrons pant behind their wall hector alone shall stand his fatal chance and hectors blood shall smoke upon thy lance thine is the glory doomd thus spake the gods then swift ascended to the bright abodes stung with new ardour thus by heaven impelld he springs impetuous and invades the field oer all the expanded plain the waters spread heaved on the bounding billows danced the dead floating midst scatterd arms while casques of gold and turndup bucklers glitterd as they rolld high oer the surging tide by leaps and bounds he wades and mounts the parted wave resounds not a whole river stops the heros course while pallas fills him with immortal force with equal rage indignant xanthus roars and lifts his billows and oerwhelms his shores then thus to simois haste my brother flood and check this mortal that controls a god our bravest heroes else shall quit the fight and ilion tumble from her towery height call then thy subject streams and bid them roar from all thy fountains swell thy watery store with broken rocks and with a load of dead charge the black surge and pour it on his head mark how resistless through the floods he goes and boldly bids the warring gods be foes but nor that force nor form divine to sight shall aught avail him if our rage unite whelmd under our dark gulfs those arms shall lie that blaze so dreadful in each trojan eye and deep beneath a sandy mountain hurld immersed remain this terror of the world such ponderous ruin shall confound the place no greeks shall eer his perishd relics grace no hand his bones shall gather or inhume these his cold rites and this his watery tomb illustration achilles contending with the rivers he said and on the chief descends amain increased with gore and swelling with the slain then murmuring from his beds he boils he raves and a foam whitens on the purple waves at every step before achilles stood the crimson surge and deluged him with blood fear touchd the queen of heaven she saw dismayd she calld aloud and summond vulcans aid rise to the war the insulting flood requires thy wasteful arm assemble all thy fires while to their aid by our command enjoind rush the swift eastern and the western wind these from old ocean at my word shall blow pour the red torrent on the watery foe corses and arms to one bright ruin turn and hissing rivers to their bottoms burn go mighty in thy rage display thy power drink the whole flood the crackling trees devour scorch all the banks and till our voice reclaim exert the unwearied furies of the flame the power ignipotent her word obeys wide oer the plain he pours the boundless blaze at once consumes the dead and dries the soil and the shrunk waters in their channel boil as when autumnal boreas sweeps the sky and instant blows the waterd gardens dry so lookd the field so whitend was the ground while vulcan breathed the fiery blast around swift on the sedgy reeds the ruin preys along the margin winds the running blaze the trees in flaming rows to ashes turn the flowering lotos and the tamarisk burn broad elm and cypress rising in a spire the watery willows hiss before the fire now glow the waves the fishes pant for breath the eels lie twisting in the pangs of death now flounce aloft now dive the scaly fry or gasping turn their bellies to the sky at length the river reard his languid head and thus shortpanting to the god he said oh vulcan oh what power resists thy might i faint i sink unequal to the fight i yieldlet ilion fall if fate decree ahbend no more thy fiery arms on me he ceased wide conflagration blazing round the bubbling waters yield a hissing sound as when the flames beneath a cauldron rise to melt the fat of some rich sacrifice amid the fierce embrace of circling fires the waters foam the heavy smoke aspires so boils the imprisond flood forbid to flow and choked with vapours feels his bottom glow to juno then imperial queen of air the burning river sends his earnest prayer ah why saturnia must thy son engage me only me with all his wasteful rage on other gods his dreadful arm employ for mightier gods assert the cause of troy submissive i desist if thou command but ah withdraw this alldestroying hand hear then my solemn oath to yield to fate unaided ilion and her destined state till greece shall gird her with destructive flame and in one ruin sink the trojan name his warm entreaty touchd saturnias ear she bade the ignipotent his rage forbear recall the flame nor in a mortal cause infest a god the obedient flame withdraws again the branching streams begin to spread and soft remurmur in their wonted bed while these by junos will the strife resign the warring gods in fierce contention join rekindling rage each heavenly breast alarms with horrid clangour shock the ethereal arms heaven in loud thunder bids the trumpet sound and wide beneath them groans the rending ground jove as his sport the dreadful scene descries and views contending gods with careless eyes the power of battles lifts his brazen spear and first assaults the radiant queen of war what moved thy madness thus to disunite ethereal minds and mix all heaven in fight what wonder this when in thy frantic mood thou drovest a mortal to insult a god thy impious hand tydides javelin bore and madly bathed it in celestial gore he spoke and smote the longresounding shield which bears joves thunder on its dreadful field the adamantine gis of her sire that turns the glancing bolt and forked fire then heaved the goddess in her mighty hand a stone the limit of the neighbouring land there fixd from eldest times black craggy vast this at the heavenly homicide she cast thundering he falls a mass of monstrous size and seven broad acres covers as he lies the stunning stroke his stubborn nerves unbound loud oer the fields his ringing arms resound the scornful dame her conquest views with smiles and glorying thus the prostrate god reviles hast thou not yet insatiate fury known how far minervas force transcends thy own juno whom thou rebellious darest withstand corrects thy folly thus by pallas hand thus meets thy broken faith with just disgrace and partial aid to troys perfidious race the goddess spoke and turnd her eyes away that beaming round diffused celestial day joves cyprian daughter stooping on the land lent to the wounded god her tender hand slowly he rises scarcely breathes with pain and proppd on her fair arm forsakes the plain this the bright empress of the heavens surveyd and scoffing thus to wars victorious maid lo what an aid on marss side is seen the smiles and loves unconquerable queen mark with what insolence in open view she moves let pallas if she dares pursue minerva smiling heard the pair oertook and slightly on her breast the wanton strook she unresisting fell her spirits fled on earth together lay the lovers spread and like these heroes be the fate of all minerva cries who guard the trojan wall to grecian gods such let the phrygian be so dread so fierce as venus is to me then from the lowest stone shall troy be moved thus she and juno with a smile approved meantime to mix in more than mortal fight the god of ocean dares the god of light what sloth has seized us when the fields around ring with conflicting powers and heaven returns the sound shall ignominious we with shame retire no deed performd to our olympian sire come prove thy arm for first the war to wage suits not my greatness or superior age rash as thou art to prop the trojan throne forgetful of my wrongs and of thy own and guard the race of proud laomedon hast thou forgot how at the monarchs prayer we shared the lengthend labours of a year troy walls i raised for such were joves commands and yon proud bulwarks grew beneath my hands thy task it was to feed the bellowing droves along fair idas vales and pendant groves but when the circling seasons in their train brought back the grateful day that crownd our pain with menace stern the fraudful king defied our latent godhead and the prize denied mad as he was he threatend servile bands and doomd us exiles far in barbarous lands incensed we heavenward fled with swiftest wing and destined vengeance on the perjured king dost thou for this afford proud ilion grace and not like us infest the faithless race like us their present future sons destroy and from its deep foundations heave their troy apollo thus to combat for mankind ill suits the wisdom of celestial mind for what is man calamitous by birth they owe their life and nourishment to earth like yearly leaves that now with beauty crownd smile on the sun now wither on the ground to their own hands commit the frantic scene nor mix immortals in a cause so mean then turns his face farbeaming heavenly fires and from the senior power submiss retires him thus retreating artemis upbraids the quiverd huntress of the sylvan shades and is it thus the youthful phbus flies and yields to oceans hoary sire the prize how vain that martial pomp and dreadful show of pointed arrows and the silver bow now boast no more in yon celestial bower thy force can match the great earthshaking power silent he heard the queen of woods upbraid not so saturnia bore the vaunting maid but furious thus what insolence has driven thy pride to face the majesty of heaven what though by jove the female plague designd fierce to the feeble race of womankind the wretched matron feels thy piercing dart thy sexs tyrant with a tigers heart what though tremendous in the woodland chase thy certain arrows pierce the savage race how dares thy rashness on the powers divine employ those arms or match thy force with mine learn hence no more unequal war to wage she said and seized her wrists with eager rage these in her left hand lockd her right untied the bow the quiver and its plumy pride about her temples flies the busy bow now here now there she winds her from the blow the scattering arrows rattling from the case drop round and idly mark the dusty place swift from the field the baffled huntress flies and scarce restrains the torrent in her eyes so when the falcon wings her way above to the cleft cavern speeds the gentle dove not fated yet to die there safe retreats yet still her heart against the marble beats to her latona hastes with tender care whom hermes viewing thus declines the war how shall i face the dame who gives delight to him whose thunders blacken heaven with night go matchless goddess triumph in the skies and boast my conquest while i yield the prize he spoke and passd latona stooping low collects the scatterd shafts and fallen bow that glittering on the dust lay here and there dishonourd relics of dianas war then swift pursued her to her blest abode where all confused she sought the sovereign god weeping she graspd his knees the ambrosial vest shook with her sighs and panted on her breast the sire superior smiled and bade her show what heavenly hand had caused his daughters woe abashd she names his own imperial spouse and the pale crescent fades upon her brows thus they above while swiftly gliding down apollo enters ilions sacred town the guardiangod now trembled for her wall and feard the greeks though fate forbade her fall back to olympus from the wars alarms return the shining bands of gods in arms some proud in triumph some with rage on fire and take their thrones around the ethereal sire through blood through death achilles still proceeds oer slaughterd heroes and oer rolling steeds as when avenging flames with fury driven on guilty towns exert the wrath of heaven the pale inhabitants some fall some fly and the red vapours purple all the sky so raged achilles death and dire dismay and toils and terrors filld the dreadful day high on a turret hoary priam stands and marks the waste of his destructive hands views from his arm the trojans scatterd flight and the near hero rising on his sight no stop no check no aid with feeble pace and settled sorrow on his aged face fast as he could he sighing quits the walls and thus descending on the guards he calls you to whose care our citygates belong set wide your portals to the flying throng for lo he comes with unresisted sway he comes and desolation marks his way but when within the walls our troops take breath lock fast the brazen bars and shut out death thus charged the reverend monarch wide were flung the opening folds the sounding hinges rung phbus rushd forth the flying bands to meet struck slaughter back and coverd the retreat on heaps the trojans crowd to gain the gate and gladsome see their last escape from fate thither all parchd with thirst a heartless train hoary with dust they beat the hollow plain and gasping panting fainting labour on with heavier strides that lengthen toward the town enraged achilles follows with his spear wild with revenge insatiable of war then had the greeks eternal praise acquired and troy inglorious to her walls retired but he the god who darts ethereal flame shot down to save her and redeem her fame to young agenor force divine he gave antenors offspring haughty bold and brave in aid of him beside the beech he sate and wrapt in clouds restraind the hand of fate when now the generous youth achilles spies thick beats his heart the troubled motions rise so ere a storm the waters heave and roll he stops and questions thus his mighty soul what shall i fly this terror of the plain like others fly and be like others slain vain hope to shun him by the selfsame road yon line of slaughterd trojans lately trod no with the common heap i scorn to fall what if they passd me to the trojan wall while i decline to yonder path that leads to idas forests and surrounding shades so may i reach conceald the cooling flood from my tired body wash the dirt and blood as soon as night her dusky veil extends return in safety to my trojan friends what ifbut wherefore all this vain debate stand i to doubt within the reach of fate even now perhaps ere yet i turn the wall the fierce achilles sees me and i fall such is his swiftness tis in vain to fly and such his valour that who stands must die howeer tis better fighting for the state here and in public view to meet my fate yet sure he too is mortal he may feel like all the sons of earth the force of steel one only soul informs that dreadful frame and joves sole favour gives him all his fame he said and stood collected in his might and all his beating bosom claimd the fight so from some deepgrown wood a panther starts roused from his thicket by a storm of darts untaught to fear or fly he hears the sounds of shouting hunters and of clamorous hounds though struck though wounded scarce perceives the pain and the barbd javelin stings his breast in vain on their whole war untamed the savage flies and tears his hunter or beneath him dies not less resolved antenors valiant heir confronts achilles and awaits the war disdainful of retreat high held before his shield a broad circumference he bore then graceful as he stood in act to throw the lifted javelin thus bespoke the foe how proud achilles glories in his fame and hopes this day to sink the trojan name beneath her ruins know that hope is vain a thousand woes a thousand toils remain parents and children our just arms employ and strong and many are the sons of troy great as thou art even thou mayst stain with gore these phrygian fields and press a foreign shore he said with matchless force the javelin flung smote on his knee the hollow cuishes rung beneath the pointed steel but safe from harms he stands impassive in the ethereal arms then fiercely rushing on the daring foe his lifted arm prepares the fatal blow but jealous of his fame apollo shrouds the godlike trojan in a veil of clouds safe from pursuit and shut from mortal view dismissd with fame the favoured youth withdrew meanwhile the god to cover their escape assumes agenors habit voice and shape flies from the furious chief in this disguise the furious chief still follows where he flies now oer the fields they stretch with lengthend strides now urge the course where swift scamander glides the god now distant scarce a stride before tempts his pursuit and wheels about the shore while all the flying troops their speed employ and pour on heaps into the walls of troy no stop no stay no thought to ask or tell who scaped by flight or who by battle fell twas tumult all and violence of flight and sudden joy confused and mixd affright pale troy against achilles shuts her gate and nations breathe deliverd from their fate book xxii argument the death of hector the trojans being safe within the walls hector only stays to oppose achilles priam is struck at his approach and tries to persuade his son to reenter the town hecuba joins her entreaties but in vain hector consults within himself what measures to take but at the advance of achilles his resolution fails him and he flies achilles pursues him thrice round the walls of troy the gods debate concerning the fate of hector at length minerva descends to the aid of achilles she deludes hector in the shape of deiphobus he stands the combat and is slain achilles drags the dead body at his chariot in the sight of priam and hecuba their lamentations tears and despair their cries reach the ears of andromache who ignorant of this was retired into the inner part of the palace she mounts up to the walls and beholds her dead husband she swoons at the spectacle her excess of grief and lamentation the thirtieth day still continues the scene lies under the walls and on the battlements of troy thus to their bulwarks smit with panic fear the herded ilians rush like driven deer there safe they wipe the briny drops away and drown in bowls the labours of the day close to the walls advancing oer the fields beneath one roof of wellcompacted shields march bending on the greeks embodied powers far stretching in the shade of trojan towers great hector singly stayd chaind down by fate there fixd he stood before the scan gate still his bold arms determined to employ the guardian still of longdefended troy apollo now to tired achilles turns the power confessd in all his glory burns and what he cries has peleus son in view with mortal speed a godhead to pursue for not to thee to know the gods is given unskilld to trace the latent marks of heaven what boots thee now that troy forsook the plain vain thy past labour and thy present vain safe in their walls are now her troops bestowd while here thy frantic rage attacks a god the chief incensedtoo partial god of day to check my conquests in the middle way how few in ilion else had refuge found what gasping numbers now had bit the ground thou robbst me of a glory justly mine powerful of godhead and of fraud divine mean fame alas for one of heavenly strain to cheat a mortal who repines in vain then to the city terrible and strong with high and haughty steps he towerd along so the proud courser victor of the prize to the near goal with double ardour flies him as he blazing shot across the field the careful eyes of priam first beheld not half so dreadful rises to the sight through the thick gloom of some tempestuous night orions dog the year when autumn weighs and oer the feebler stars exerts his rays terrific glory for his burning breath taints the red air with fevers plagues and death so flamed his fiery mail then wept the sage he strikes his reverend head now white with age he lifts his witherd arms obtests the skies he calls his muchloved son with feeble cries the son resolved achilles force to dare full at the scan gates expects the war while the sad father on the rampart stands and thus adjures him with extended hands ah stay not stay not guardless and alone hector my loved my dearest bravest son methinks already i behold thee slain and stretchd beneath that fury of the plain implacable achilles mightst thou be to all the gods no dearer than to me thee vultures wild should scatter round the shore and bloody dogs grow fiercer from thy gore how many valiant sons i late enjoyd valiant in vain by thy cursed arm destroyd or worse than slaughtered sold in distant isles to shameful bondage and unworthy toils two while i speak my eyes in vain explore two from one mother sprung my polydore and loved lycaon now perhaps no more oh if in yonder hostile camp they live what heaps of gold what treasures would i give their grandsires wealth by right of birth their own consignd his daughter with lelegias throne but if which heaven forbid already lost all pale they wander on the stygian coast what sorrows then must their sad mother know what anguish i unutterable woe yet less that anguish less to her to me less to all troy if not deprived of thee yet shun achilles enter yet the wall and spare thyself thy father spare us all save thy dear life or if a soul so brave neglect that thought thy dearer glory save pity while yet i live these silver hairs while yet thy father feels the woes he bears yet cursed with sense a wretch whom in his rage all trembling on the verge of helpless age great jove has placed sad spectacle of pain the bitter dregs of fortunes cup to drain to fill with scenes of death his closing eyes and number all his days by miseries my heroes slain my bridal bed oerturnd my daughters ravishd and my city burnd my bleeding infants dashd against the floor these i have yet to see perhaps yet more perhaps even i reserved by angry fate the last sad relic of my ruind state dire pomp of sovereign wretchedness must fall and stain the pavement of my regal hall where famishd dogs late guardians of my door shall lick their mangled masters spatterd gore yet for my sons i thank ye gods tis well well have they perishd for in fight they fell who dies in youth and vigour dies the best struck through with wounds all honest on the breast but when the fates in fulness of their rage spurn the hoar head of unresisting age in dust the reverend lineaments deform and pour to dogs the lifeblood scarcely warm this this is misery the last the worse that man can feel man fated to be cursed he said and acting what no words could say rent from his head the silver locks away with him the mournful mother bears a part yet all her sorrows turn not hectors heart the zone unbraced her bosom she displayd and thus fastfalling the salt tears she said have mercy on me o my son revere the words of age attend a parents prayer if ever thee in these fond arms i pressd or stilld thy infant clamours at this breast ah do not thus our helpless years forego but by our walls secured repel the foe against his rage if singly thou proceed shouldst thou but heaven avert it shouldst thou bleed nor must thy corse lie honourd on the bier nor spouse nor mother grace thee with a tear far from our pious rites those dear remains must feast the vultures on the naked plains so they while down their cheeks the torrents roll but fixd remains the purpose of his soul resolved he stands and with a fiery glance expects the heros terrible advance so rolld up in his den the swelling snake beholds the traveller approach the brake when fed with noxious herbs his turgid veins have gatherd half the poisons of the plains he burns he stiffens with collected ire and his red eyeballs glare with living fire beneath a turret on his shield reclined he stood and questiond thus his mighty mind where lies my way to enter in the wall honour and shame the ungenerous thought recall shall proud polydamas before the gate proclaim his counsels are obeyd too late which timely followd but the former night what numbers had been saved by hectors flight that wise advice rejected with disdain i feel my folly in my people slain methinks my suffering countrys voice i hear but most her worthless sons insult my ear on my rash courage charge the chance of war and blame those virtues which they cannot share noif i eer return return i must glorious my countrys terror laid in dust or if i perish let her see me fall in field at least and fighting for her wall and yet suppose these measures i forego approach unarmd and parley with the foe the warriorshield the helm and lance lay down and treat on terms of peace to save the town the wife withheld the treasure illdetaind cause of the war and grievance of the land with honourable justice to restore and add half ilions yet remaining store which troy shall sworn produce that injured greece may share our wealth and leave our walls in peace but why this thought unarmd if i should go what hope of mercy from this vengeful foe but womanlike to fall and fall without a blow we greet not here as man conversing man met at an oak or journeying oer a plain no season now for calm familiar talk like youths and maidens in an evening walk war is our business but to whom is given to die or triumph that determine heaven thus pondering like a god the greek drew nigh his dreadful plumage nodded from on high the pelian javelin in his better hand shot trembling rays that glitterd oer the land and on his breast the beamy splendour shone like joves own lightning or the rising sun as hector sees unusual terrors rise struck by some god he fears recedes and flies he leaves the gates he leaves the wall behind achilles follows like the winged wind thus at the panting dove a falcon flies the swiftest racer of the liquid skies just when he holds or thinks he holds his prey obliquely wheeling through the aerial way with open beak and shrilling cries he springs and aims his claws and shoots upon his wings no less foreright the rapid chase they held one urged by fury one by fear impelld now circling round the walls their course maintain where the high watchtower overlooks the plain now where the figtrees spread their umbrage broad a wider compass smoke along the road next by scamanders double source they bound where two famed fountains burst the parted ground this hot through scorching clefts is seen to rise with exhalations steaming to the skies that the green banks in summers heat oerflows like crystal clear and cold as winter snows each gushing fount a marble cistern fills whose polishd bed receives the falling rills where trojan dames ere yet alarmd by greece washd their fair garments in the days of peace by these they passd one chasing one in flight the mighty fled pursued by stronger might swift was the course no vulgar prize they play no vulgar victim must reward the day such as in races crown the speedy strife the prize contended was great hectors life as when some heros funerals are decreed in grateful honour of the mighty dead where high rewards the vigorous youth inflame some golden tripod or some lovely dame the panting coursers swiftly turn the goal and with them turns the raised spectators soul thus three times round the trojan wall they fly the gazing gods lean forward from the sky to whom while eager on the chase they look the sire of mortals and immortals spoke unworthy sight the man beloved of heaven behold inglorious round yon city driven my heart partakes the generous hectors pain hector whose zeal whole hecatombs has slain whose grateful fumes the gods received with joy from idas summits and the towers of troy now see him flying to his fears resignd and fate and fierce achilles close behind consult ye powers tis worthy your debate whether to snatch him from impending fate or let him bear by stern pelides slain good as he is the lot imposed on man then pallas thus shall he whose vengeance forms the forky bolt and blackens heaven with storms shall he prolong one trojans forfeit breath a man a mortal preordaind to death and will no murmurs fill the courts above no gods indignant blame their partial jove go then returnd the sire without delay exert thy will i give the fates their way swift at the mandate pleased tritonia flies and stoops impetuous from the cleaving skies as through the forest oer the vale and lawn the wellbreathd beagle drives the flying fawn in vain he tries the covert of the brakes or deep beneath the trembling thicket shakes sure of the vapour in the tainted dews the certain hound his various maze pursues thus step by step whereer the trojan wheeld there swift achilles compassd round the field oft as to reach the dardan gates he bends and hopes the assistance of his pitying friends whose showering arrows as he coursed below from the high turrets might oppress the foe so oft achilles turns him to the plain he eyes the city but he eyes in vain as men in slumbers seem with speedy pace one to pursue and one to lead the chase their sinking limbs the fancied course forsake nor this can fly nor that can overtake no less the labouring heroes pant and strain while that but flies and this pursues in vain what god o muse assisted hectors force with fate itself so long to hold the course phbus it was who in his latest hour endued his knees with strength his nerves with power and great achilles lest some greeks advance should snatch the glory from his lifted lance signd to the troops to yield his foe the way and leave untouchd the honours of the day jove lifts the golden balances that show the fates of mortal men and things below here each contending heros lot he tries and weighs with equal hand their destinies low sinks the scale surcharged with hectors fate heavy with death it sinks and hell receives the weight then phbus left him fierce minerva flies to stern pelides and triumphing cries o loved of jove this day our labours cease and conquest blazes with full beams on greece great hector falls that hector famed so far drunk with renown insatiable of war falls by thy hand and mine nor force nor flight shall more avail him nor his god of light see where in vain he supplicates above rolld at the feet of unrelenting jove rest here myself will lead the trojan on and urge to meet the fate he cannot shun her voice divine the chief with joyful mind obeyd and rested on his lance reclined while like deiphobus the martial dame her face her gesture and her arms the same in show an aid by hapless hectors side approachd and greets him thus with voice belied too long o hector have i borne the sight of this distress and sorrowd in thy flight it fits us now a noble stand to make and here as brothers equal fates partake then he o prince allied in blood and fame dearer than all that own a brothers name of all that hecuba to priam bore long tried long loved much loved but honoured more since you of all our numerous race alone defend my life regardless of your own again the goddess much my fathers prayer and much

or let us stretch achilles on the field or to his arm our bloody trophies yield fraudful she said then swiftly marchd before the dardan hero shuns his foe no more sternly they met the silence hector broke his dreadful plumage nodded as he spoke enough o son of peleus troy has viewd her walls thrice circled and her chief pursued but now some god within me bids me try thine or my fate i kill thee or i die yet on the verge of battle let us stay and for a moments space suspend the day let heavens high powers be calld to arbitrate the just conditions of this stern debate eternal witnesses of all below and faithful guardians of the treasured vow to them i swear if victor in the strife jove by these hands shall shed thy noble life no vile dishonour shall thy corse pursue strippd of its arms alone the conquerors due the rest to greece uninjured ill restore now plight thy mutual oath i ask no more talk not of oaths the dreadful chief replies while anger flashd from his disdainful eyes detested as thou art and ought to be nor oath nor pact achilles plights with thee such pacts as lambs and rabid wolves combine such leagues as men and furious lions join to such i call the gods one constant state of lasting rancour and eternal hate no thought but rage and neverceasing strife till death extinguish rage and thought and life rouse then thy forces this important hour collect thy soul and call forth all thy power no further subterfuge no further chance tis pallas pallas gives thee to my lance each grecian ghost by thee deprived of breath now hovers round and calls thee to thy death he spoke and launchd his javelin at the foe but hector shunnd the meditated blow he stoopd while oer his head the flying spear sang innocent and spent its force in air minerva watchd it falling on the land then drew and gave to great achilles hand unseen of hector who elate with joy now shakes his lance and braves the dread of troy the life you boasted to that javelin given prince you have missd my fate depends on heaven to thee presumptuous as thou art unknown or what must prove my fortune or thy own boasting is but an art our fears to blind and with false terrors sink anothers mind but know whatever fate i am to try by no dishonest wound shall hector die i shall not fall a fugitive at least my soul shall bravely issue from my breast but first try thou my arm and may this dart end all my countrys woes deep buried in thy heart the weapon flew its course unerring held unerring but the heavenly shield repelld the mortal dart resulting with a bound from off the ringing orb it struck the ground hector beheld his javelin fall in vain nor other lance nor other hope remain he calls deiphobus demands a spear in vain for no deiphobus was there all comfortless he stands then with a sigh tis soheaven wills it and my hour is nigh i deemd deiphobus had heard my call but he secure lies guarded in the wall a god deceived me pallas twas thy deed death and black fate approach tis i must bleed no refuge now no succour from above great jove deserts me and the son of jove propitious once and kind then welcome fate tis true i perish yet i perish great yet in a mighty deed i shall expire let future ages hear it and admire fierce at the word his weighty sword he drew and all collected on achilles flew so joves bold bird high balanced in the air stoops from the clouds to truss the quivering hare nor less achilles his fierce soul prepares before his breast the flaming shield he bears refulgent orb above his fourfold cone the gilded horsehair sparkled in the sun nodding at every step vulcanian frame and as he moved his figure seemd on flame as radiant hesper shines with keener light farbeaming oer the silver host of night when all the starry train emblaze the sphere so shone the point of great achilles spear in his right hand he waves the weapon round eyes the whole man and meditates the wound but the rich mail patroclus lately wore securely cased the warriors body oer one space at length he spies to let in fate where twixt the neck and throat the jointed plate gave entrance through that penetrable part furious he drove the welldirected dart nor pierced the windpipe yet nor took the power of speech unhappy from thy dying hour prone on the field the bleeding warrior lies while thus triumphing stern achilles cries at last is hector stretchd upon the plain who feard no vengeance for patroclus slain then prince you should have feard what now you feel achilles absent was achilles still yet a short space the great avenger stayed then low in dust thy strength and glory laid peaceful he sleeps with all our rites adornd for ever honourd and for ever mournd while cast to all the rage of hostile power thee birds shall mangle and the gods devour then hector fainting at the approach of death by thy own soul by those who gave thee breath by all the sacred prevalence of prayer ah leave me not for grecian dogs to tear the common rites of sepulture bestow to soothe a fathers and a mothers woe let their large gifts procure an urn at least and hectors ashes in his country rest no wretch accursed relentless he replies flames as he spoke shot flashing from his eyes not those who gave me breath should bid me spare nor all the sacred prevalence of prayer could i myself the bloody banquet join noto the dogs that carcase i resign should troy to bribe me bring forth all her store and giving thousands offer thousands more should dardan priam and his weeping dame drain their whole realm to buy one funeral flame their hector on the pile they should not see nor rob the vultures of one limb of thee then thus the chief his dying accents drew thy rage implacable too well i knew the furies that relentless breast have steeld and cursed thee with a heart that cannot yield yet think a day will come when fates decree and angry gods shall wreak this wrong on thee phbus and paris shall avenge my fate and stretch thee here before the scan gate he ceased the fates suppressd his labouring breath and his eyes stiffend at the hand of death to the dark realm the spirit wings its way the manly body left a load of clay and plaintive glides along the dreary coast a naked wandering melancholy ghost achilles musing as he rolld his eyes oer the dead hero thus unheard replies die thou the first when jove and heaven ordain i follow theehe said and strippd the slain then forcing backward from the gaping wound the reeking javelin cast it on the ground the thronging greeks behold with wondering eyes his manly beauty and superior size while some ignobler the great dead deface with wounds ungenerous or with taunts disgrace how changed that hector who like jove of late sent lightning on our fleets and scatterd fate high oer the slain the great achilles stands begirt with heroes and surrounding bands and thus aloud while all the host attends princes and leaders countrymen and friends since now at length the powerful will of heaven the dire destroyer to our arm has given is not troy fallen already haste ye powers see if already their deserted towers are left unmannd or if they yet retain the souls of heroes their great hector slain but what is troy or glory what to me or why reflects my mind on aught but thee divine patroclus death hath seald his eyes unwept unhonourd uninterrd he lies can his dear image from my soul depart long as the vital spirit moves my heart if in the melancholy shades below the flames of friends and lovers cease to glow yet mine shall sacred last mine undecayd burn on through death and animate my shade meanwhile ye sons of greece in triumph bring the corpse of hector and your pans sing be this the song slowmoving toward the shore hector is dead and ilion is no more then his fell soul a thought of vengeance bred unworthy of himself and of the dead the nervous ancles bored his feet he bound with thongs inserted through the double wound these fixd up high behind the rolling wain his graceful head was traild along the plain proud on his car the insulting victor stood and bore aloft his arms distilling blood he smites the steeds the rapid chariot flies the sudden clouds of circling dust arise now lost is all that formidable air the face divine and longdescending hair purple the ground and streak the sable sand deformd dishonourd in his native land given to the rage of an insulting throng

moans while the sad father answers groans with groans tears after tears his mournful cheeks oerflow and the whole city wears one face of woe no less than if the rage of hostile fires from her foundations curling to her spires oer the proud citadel at length should rise and the last blaze send ilion to the skies the wretched monarch of the falling state distracted presses to the dardan gate scarce the whole people stop his desperate course while strong affliction gives the feeble force grief tears his heart and drives him to and fro in all the raging impotence of woe at length he rolld in dust and thus begun imploring all and naming one by one ah let me let me go where sorrow calls i only i will issue from your walls guide or companion friends i ask ye none and bow before the murderer of my son my grief perhaps his pity may engage perhaps at least he may respect my age he has a father too a man like me one not exempt from age and misery vigorous no more as when his young

to the grave o had thy gentle spirit passd in peace the son expiring in the sires embrace while both thy parents wept the fatal hour and bending oer thee mixd the tender shower some comfort that had been some sad relief to melt in full satiety of grief thus waild the father grovelling on the ground and all the eyes of ilion streamd around amidst her matrons hecuba appears a mourning princess and

with tear book xxiii argument funeral games in honour of patroclus achilles and the myrmidons do honours to the body of patroclus after the funeral feast he retires to the seashore where falling asleep the ghost of his friend appears to him and demands the rites of burial the next morning the soldiers are sent with mules and waggons to fetch wood for the pyre the funeral procession and the offering their hair to the dead achilles sacrifices several animals and lastly twelve trojan captives at the pile then sets fire to it he pays libations to the winds which at the instance of iris rise and raise the flames when the pile has burned all night they gather the bones place them in an urn of gold and raise the tomb achilles institutes the funeral games the chariotrace the fight of the

make the greatest part of the book in this book ends the thirtieth day the night following the ghost of patroclus appears to achilles the oneandthirtieth day is employed in felling the timber for the pile the twoandthirtieth in burning it and the threeandthirtieth in the games the scene is generally on the seashore thus humbled in the dust the pensive train through the sad city mournd her hero slain the body soild with dust and black with gore lies on broad hellesponts resounding shore the grecians seek their ships and clear the strand all but the martial myrmidonian band these yet assembled great achilles holds and the stern purpose of his mind unfolds not yet my brave companions of the war release your smoking coursers from the car but with his chariot each in order led perform due honours to patroclus dead ere yet from rest or food we seek relief some rites remain to glut our rage of grief the troops obeyd and thrice in order led achilles first their coursers round the dead and thrice their sorrows and laments renew tears bathe their arms and tears the sands bedew for such a warrior thetis aids their woe melts their strong hearts and bids their eyes to flow but chief pelides thicksucceeding sighs burst from his heart and torrents from his eyes his slaughtering hands yet red with blood he laid on his dead friends cold breast and thus he said all hail patroclus let thy honourd ghost hear and rejoice on plutos dreary coast behold achilles promise is complete the bloody hector stretchd before thy feet lo to the dogs his carcase i resign and twelve sad victims of the trojan line sacred to vengeance instant shall expire their lives effused around thy funeral pyre gloomy he said and horrible to view before the bier the bleeding hector threw prone on the dust the myrmidons around unbraced their armour and the steeds unbound all to achilles sable ship repair frequent and full the genial feast to share now from the wellfed swine black smokes aspire the bristly victims hissing oer the fire the huge ox bellowing falls with feebler cries expires the goat the sheep in silence dies around the heros prostrate body flowd in one promiscuous stream the reeking blood and now a band of argive monarchs brings the glorious victor to the king of kings from his dead friend the pensive warrior went with steps unwilling to the regal tent the attending heralds as by office bound with kindled flames the tripodvase surround to cleanse his conquering hands from hostile gore they urged in vain the chief refused and swore no drop shall touch me by almighty jove the first and greatest of the gods above till on the pyre i place thee till i rear the grassy mound and clip thy sacred hair some ease at least those pious rites may give and soothe my sorrows while i bear to live howeer reluctant as i am i stay and share your feast but with the dawn of day o king of men it claims thy royal care that greece the warriors funeral pile prepare and bid the forests fall such rites are paid to heroes slumbering in eternal shade then when his earthly part shall mount in fire let the leagued squadrons to their posts retire he spoke they hear him and the word obey the rage of hunger and of thirst allay then ease in sleep the labours of the day but great pelides stretchd along the shore where dashd on rocks the broken billows roar lies inly groaning while on either hand the martial myrmidons confusedly stand along the grass his languid members fall tired with his chase around the trojan wall hushd by the murmurs of the rolling deep at length he sinks in the soft arms of sleep when lo the shade before his closing eyes of sad patroclus rose or seemd to rise in the same robe he living wore he came in stature voice and pleasing look the same the form familiar hoverd oer his head and sleeps achilles thus the phantom said sleeps my achilles his patroclus dead living i seemd his dearest tenderest care but now forgot i wander in the air let my pale corse the rites of burial know and give me entrance in the realms below till then the spirit finds no restingplace but here and there the unbodied spectres chase the vagrant dead around the dark abode forbid to cross the irremeable flood now give thy hand for to the farther shore when once we pass the soul returns no more when once the last funereal flames ascend no more shall meet achilles and his friend no more our thoughts to those we loved make known or quit the dearest to converse alone me fate has severd from the sons of earth the fate foredoomd that waited from my birth thee too it waits before the trojan wall even great and godlike thou art doomd to fall hear then and as in fate and love we join ah suffer that my bones may rest with thine together have we lived together bred one house received us and one table fed that golden urn thy goddessmother gave may mix our ashes in one common grave and is it thou he answers to my sight once more returnst thou from the realms of night o more than brother think each office paid whateer can rest a discontented shade but grant one last embrace unhappy boy afford at least that melancholy joy he said and with his longing arms essayd in vain to grasp the visionary shade like a thin smoke he sees the spirit fly and hears a feeble lamentable cry confused he wakes amazement breaks the bands of golden sleep and starting from the sands pensive he muses with uplifted hands tis true tis certain man though dead retains part of himself the immortal mind remains the form subsists without the bodys aid aerial semblance and an empty shade this night my friend so late in battle lost stood at my side a pensive plaintive ghost even now familiar as in life he came alas how different yet how like the same thus while he spoke each eye grew big with tears and now the rosyfingerd morn appears shows every mournful face with tears oerspread and glares on the pale visage of the dead but agamemnon as the rites demand with mules and waggons sends a chosen band to load the timber and the pile to rear a charge consignd to merions faithful care with proper instruments they take the road axes to cut and ropes to sling the load first march the heavy mules securely slow oer hills oer dales oer crags oer rocks they go jumping high oer the shrubs of the rough ground rattle the clattering cars and the shockd axles bound but when arrived at idas spreading woods fair ida waterd with descending floods loud sounds the axe redoubling strokes on strokes on all sides round the forest hurls her oaks headlong deep echoing groan the thickets brown then rustling crackling crashing thunder down the wood the grecians cleave prepared to burn and the slow mules the same rough road return the sturdy woodmen equal burdens bore such charge was given them to the sandy shore there on the spot which great achilles showd they eased their shoulders and disposed the load circling around the place where times to come shall view patroclus and achilles tomb the hero bids his martial troops appear high on their cars in all the pomp of war each in refulgent arms his limbs attires all mount their chariots combatants and squires the chariots first proceed a shining train then clouds of foot that smoke along the plain next these the melancholy band appear amidst lay dead patroclus on the bier oer all the corse their scattered locks they throw achilles next oppressd with mighty woe supporting with his hands the heros head bends oer the extended body of the dead patroclus decent on the appointed ground they place and heap the sylvan pile around but great achilles stands apart in prayer and from his head divides the yellow hair those curling locks which from his youth he vowd and sacred grew to sperchius honourd flood then sighing to the deep his locks he cast and rolld his eyes around the watery waste sperchius whose waves in mazy errors lost delightful roll along my native coast to whom we vainly vowd at our return these locks to fall and hecatombs to burn full fifty rams to bleed in sacrifice where to the day thy silver fountains rise and where in shade of consecrated bowers thy altars stand perfumed with native flowers so vowd my father but he vowd in vain no more achilles sees his native plain in that vain hope these hairs no longer grow patroclus bears them to the shades below thus oer patroclus while the hero prayd on his cold hand the sacred lock he laid once more afresh the grecian sorrows flow and now the sun had set upon their woe but to the king of men thus spoke the chief enough atrides give the troops relief permit the mourning legions to retire and let the chiefs alone attend the pyre the pious care be ours the dead to burn he said the people to their ships return while those deputed to inter the slain heap with a rising pyramid the plain a hundred foot in length a hundred wide the growing structure spreads on every side high on the top the manly corse they lay and wellfed sheep and sable oxen slay achilles covered with their fat the dead and the piled victims round the body spread then jars of honey and of fragrant oil suspends around lowbending oer the pile four sprightly coursers with a deadly groan pour forth their lives and on the pyre are thrown of nine large dogs domestic at his board fall two selected to attend their lord then last of all and horrible to tell sad sacrifice twelve trojan captives fell on these the rage of fire victorious preys involves and joins them in one common blaze smeard with the bloody rites he stands on high and calls the spirit with a dreadful cry all hail patroclus let thy vengeful ghost hear and exult on plutos dreary coast behold achilles promise fully paid twelve trojan heroes offerd to thy shade but heavier fates on hectors corse attend saved from the flames for hungry dogs to rend so spake he threatening but the gods made vain his threat and guard inviolate the slain celestial venus hoverd oer his head and roseate unguents heavenly fragrance shed she watchd him all the night and all the day and drove the bloodhounds from their destined prey nor sacred phbus less employd his care he pourd around a veil of gatherd air and kept the nerves undried the flesh entire against the solar beam and sirian fire illustration the funeral pile of patroclus nor yet the pile where dead patroclus lies smokes nor as yet the sullen flames arise but fast beside achilles stood in prayer invoked the gods whose spirit moves the air and victims promised and libations cast to gentle zephyr and the boreal blast he calld the aerial powers along the skies to breathe and whisper to the fires to rise the winged iris heard the heros call and instant hastend to their airy hall where in old zephyrs open courts on high sat all the blustering brethren of the sky she shone amidst them on her painted bow the rocky pavement glitterd with the show all from the banquet rise and each invites the various goddess to partake the rites not so the dame replied i haste to go to sacred ocean and the floods below even now our solemn hecatombs attend and heaven is feasting on the worlds green end with righteous ethiops uncorrupted train far on the extremest limits of the main but peleus son entreats with sacrifice the western spirit and the north to rise let on patroclus pile your blast be driven and bear the blazing honours high to heaven swift as the word she vanishd from their view swift as the word the winds tumultuous flew forth burst the stormy band with thundering roar and heaps on heaps the clouds are tossd before to the wide main then stooping from the skies the heaving deeps in watery mountains rise troy feels the blast along her shaking walls till on the pile the gatherd tempest falls the structure crackles in the roaring fires and all the night the plenteous flame aspires all night achilles hails patroclus soul with large libations from the golden bowl as a poor father helpless and undone mourns oer the ashes of an only son takes a sad pleasure the last bones to burn and pours in tears ere yet they close the urn so stayd achilles circling round the shore so watchd the flames till now they flame no more twas when emerging through the shades of night the morning planet told the approach of light and fast behind auroras warmer ray oer the broad ocean pourd the golden day then sank the blaze the pile no longer burnd and to their caves the whistling winds returnd across the thracian seas their course they bore the ruffled seas beneath their passage roar then parting from the pile he ceased to weep and sank to quiet in the embrace of sleep exhausted with his grief meanwhile the crowd of thronging grecians round achilles stood the tumult waked him from his eyes he shook unwilling slumber and the chiefs bespoke ye kings and princes of the achaian name first let us quench the yet remaining flame with sable wine then as the rites direct the heros bones with careful view select apart and easy to be known they lie amidst the heap and obvious to the eye the rest around the margin will be seen promiscuous steeds and immolated men these wrappd in double cauls of fat prepare and in the golden vase dispose with care there let them rest with decent honour laid till i shall follow to the infernal shade meantime erect the tomb with pious hands a common structure on the humble sands hereafter greece some nobler work may raise and late posterity record our praise the greeks obey where yet the embers glow wide oer the pile the sable wine they throw and deep subsides the ashy heap below next the white bones his sad companions place with tears collected in the golden vase the sacred relics to the tent they bore the urn a veil of linen covered oer that done they bid the sepulchre aspire and cast the deep foundations round the pyre high in the midst they heap the swelling bed of rising earth memorial of the dead the swarming populace the chief detains and leads amidst a wide extent of plains there placed them round then from the ships proceeds a train of oxen mules and stately steeds vases and tripods for the funeral games resplendent brass and more resplendent dames first stood the prizes to reward the force of rapid racers in the dusty course a woman for the first in beautys bloom skilld in the needle and the labouring loom and a large vase where two bright handles rise of twenty measures its capacious size the second victor claims a mare unbroke big with a mule unknowing of the yoke the third a charger yet untouchd by flame four ample measures held the shining frame two golden talents for the fourth were placed an ample double bowl contents the last these in fair order ranged upon the plain the hero rising thus addressd the train behold the prizes valiant greeks decreed to the brave rulers of the racing steed prizes which none beside ourself could gain should our immortal coursers take the plain a race unrivalld which from oceans god peleus received and on his son bestowd but this no time our vigour to display nor suit with them the games of this sad day lost is patroclus now that wont to deck their flowing manes and sleek their glossy neck sad as they shared in human grief they stand and trail those graceful honours on the sand let others for the noble task prepare who trust the courser and the flying car fired at his word the rival racers rise but far the first eumelus hopes the prize famed though pieria for the fleetest breed and skilld to manage the highbounding steed with equal ardour bold tydides swelld the steeds of tros beneath his yoke compelld which late obeyd the dardan chiefs command when scarce a god redeemd him from his hand then menelaus his podargus brings and the famed courser of the king of kings whom rich echepolus more rich than brave to scape the wars to agamemnon gave the her name at home to end his days base wealth preferring to eternal praise next him antilochus demands the course with beating heart and cheers his pylian horse experienced nestor gives his son the reins directs his judgment and his heat restrains nor idly warns the hoary sire nor hears the prudent son with unattending ears my son though youthful ardour fire thy breast the gods have loved thee and with arts have blessd neptune and jove on thee conferrd the skill swift round the goal to turn the flying wheel to guide thy conduct little precept needs but slow and past their vigour are my steeds fear not thy rivals though for swiftness known compare those rivals judgment and thy own it is not strength but art obtains the prize and to be swift is less than to be wise tis more by art than force of numerous strokes the dexterous woodman shapes the stubborn oaks by art the pilot through the boiling deep and howling tempest steers the fearless ship and tis the artist wins the glorious course not those who trust in chariots and in horse in vain unskilful to the goal they strive and short or wide the ungovernd courser drive while with sure skill though with inferior steeds the knowing racer to his end proceeds fixd on the goal his eye foreruns the course his hand unerring steers the steady horse and now contracts or now extends the rein observing still the foremost on the plain mark then the goal tis easy to be found yon aged trunk a cubit from the ground of some once stately oak the last remains or hardy fir unperishd with the rains inclosed with stones conspicuous from afar and round a circle for the wheeling car some tomb perhaps of old the dead to grace or then as now the limit of a race bear close to this and warily proceed a little bending to the lefthand steed but urge the right and give him all the reins while thy strict hand his fellows head restrains and turns him short till doubling as they roll the wheels round naves appear to brush the goal yet not to break the car or lame the horse clear of the stony heap direct the course lest through incaution failing thou mayst be a joy to others a reproach to me so shalt thou pass the goal secure of mind and leave unskilful swiftness far behind though thy fierce rival drove the matchless steed which bore adrastus of celestial breed or the famed race through all the regions known that whirld the car of proud laomedon thus nought unsaid the muchadvising sage concludes then sat stiff with unwieldy age next bold meriones was seen to rise the last but not least ardent for the prize they mount their seats the lots their place dispose rolld in his helmet these achilles throws young nestor leads the race eumelus then and next the brother of the king of men thy lot meriones the fourth was cast and far the bravest diomed was last they stand in order an impatient train pelides points the barrier on the plain and sends before old phnix to the place to mark the racers and to judge the race at once the coursers from the barrier bound the lifted scourges all at once resound their heart their eyes their voice they send before and up the champaign thunder from the shore thick where they drive the dusty clouds arise and the lost courser in the whirlwind flies loose on their shoulders the long manes reclined float in their speed and dance upon the wind the smoking chariots rapid as they bound now seem to touch the sky and now the ground while hot for fame and conquest all their care each oer his flying courser hung in air erect with ardour poised upon the rein they pant they stretch they shout along the plain now the last compass fetchd around the goal at the near prize each gathers all his soul each burns with double hope with double pain tears up the shore and thunders toward the main first flew eumelus on pheretian steeds with those of tros bold diomed succeeds close on eumelus back they puff the wind and seem just mounting on his car behind full on his neck he feels the sultry breeze and hovering oer their stretching shadows sees then had he lost or left a doubtful prize but angry phbus to tydides flies strikes from his hand the scourge and renders vain his matchless horses labour on the plain rage fills his eye with anguish to survey snatchd from his hope the glories of the day the fraud celestial pallas sees with pain springs to her knight and gives the scourge again and fills his steeds with vigour at a stroke she breaks his rivals chariot from the yoke no more their way the startled horses held the car reversed came rattling on the field shot headlong from his seat beside the wheel prone on the dust the unhappy master fell his batterd face and elbows strike the ground nose mouth and front one undistinguishd wound grief stops his voice a torrent drowns his eyes before him far the glad tydides flies minervas spirit drives his matchless pace and crowns him victor of the labourd race the next though distant menelaus succeeds while thus young nestor animates his steeds now now my generous pair exert your force not that we hope to match tydides horse since great minerva wings their rapid way and gives their lord the honours of the day but reach atrides shall his mare outgo your swiftness vanquishd by a female foe through your neglect if lagging on the plain the last ignoble gift be all we gain no more shall nestors hand your food supply the old mans fury rises and ye die haste then yon narrow road before our sight presents the occasion could we use it right thus he the coursers at their masters threat with quicker steps the sounding champaign beat and now antilochus with nice survey observes the compass of the hollow way twas where by force of wintry torrents torn fast by the road a precipice was worn here where but one could pass to shun the throng the spartan heros chariot smoked along close up the venturous youth resolves to keep still edging near and bears him toward the steep atrides trembling casts his eye below and wonders at the rashness of his foe hold stay your steedswhat madness thus to ride this narrow way take larger field he cried or both must fallatrides cried in vain he flies more fast and throws up all the rein far as an able arm the disk can send when youthful rivals their full force extend so far antilochus thy chariot flew before the king he cautious backward drew his horse compelld foreboding in his fears the rattling ruin of the clashing cars the floundering coursers rolling on the plain and conquest lost through frantic haste to gain but thus upbraids his rival as he flies go furious youth ungenerous and unwise go but expect not ill the prize resign add perjury to fraud and make it thine then to his steeds with all his force he cries be swift be vigorous and regain the prize your rivals destitute of youthful force with fainting knees shall labour in the course and yield the glory yoursthe steeds obey already at their heels they wing their way and seem already to retrieve the day meantime the grecians in a ring beheld the coursers bounding oer the dusty field the first who markd them was the cretan king high on a rising ground above the ring the monarch sat from whence with sure survey he well observed the chief who led the way and heard from far his animating cries and saw the foremost steed with sharpend eyes on whose broad front a blaze of shining white like the full moon stood obvious to the sight he saw and rising to the greeks begun are yonder horse discernd by me alone or can ye all another chief survey and other steeds than lately led the way those though the swiftest by some god withheld lie sure disabled in the middle field for since the goal they doubled round the plain i search to find them but i search in vain perchance the reins forsook the drivers hand and turnd too short he tumbled on the strand shot from the chariot while his coursers stray with frantic fury from the destined way rise then some other and inform my sight for these dim eyes perhaps discern not right yet sure he seems to judge by shape and air the great tolian chief renownd in war old man oleus rashly thus replies thy tongue too hastily confers the prize of those who view the course nor sharpest eyed nor youngest yet the readiest to decide eumelus steeds high bounding in the chase still as at first unrivalld lead the race i well discern him as he shakes the rein and hear his shouts victorious oer the plain thus he idomeneus incensed rejoind barbarous of words and arrogant of mind contentious prince of all the greeks beside the last in merit as the first in pride to vile reproach what answer can we make a goblet or a tripod let us stake and be the king the judge the most unwise will learn their rashness when they pay the price he said and ajax by mad passion borne stern had replied fierce scorn enhancing scorn to fell extremes but thetis godlike son awful amidst them rose and thus begun forbear ye chiefs reproachful to contend much would ye blame should others thus offend and lo the approaching steeds your contest end no sooner had he spoke but thundering near drives through a stream of dust the charioteer high oer his head the circling lash he wields his bounding horses scarcely touch the fields his car amidst the dusty whirlwind rolld bright with the mingled blaze of tin and gold refulgent through the cloud no eye could find the track his flying wheels had left behind and the fierce coursers urged their rapid pace so swift it seemd a flight and not a race now victor at the goal tydides stands quits his bright car and springs upon the sands from the hot steeds the sweaty torrents stream the wellplied whip is hung athwart the beam with joy brave sthenelus receives the prize the tripodvase and dame with radiant eyes these to the ships his train triumphant leads the chief himself unyokes the panting steeds young nestor follows who by art not force oerpassd atrides second in the course behind atrides urged the race more near than to the courser in his swift career the following car just touching with his heel and brushing with his tail the whirling wheel such and so narrow now the space between the rivals late so distant on the green so soon swift the her lost ground regaind one length one moment had the race obtaind merion pursued at greater distance still with tardier coursers and inferior skill last came admetus thy unhappy son slow dragged the steeds his batterd chariot on achilles saw and pitying thus begun behold the man whose matchless art surpassd the sons of greece the ablest yet the last fortune denies but justice bids us pay since great tydides bears the first away to him the second honours of the day the greeks consent with loudapplauding cries and then eumelus had received the prize but youthful nestor jealous of his fame the award opposes and asserts his claim think not he cries i tamely will resign o peleus son the mare so justly mine what if the gods the skilful to confound have thrown the horse and horseman to the ground perhaps he sought not heaven by sacrifice and vows omitted forfeited the prize if yet distinction to thy friend to show and please a soul desirous to bestow some gift must grace eumelus view thy store of beauteous handmaids steeds and shining ore an ample present let him thence receive and greece shall praise thy generous thirst to give but this my prize i never shall forego this who but touches warriors is my foe thus spake the youth nor did his words offend pleased with the wellturnd flattery of a friend achilles smiled the gift proposed he cried antilochus we shall ourself provide with plates of brass the corslet coverd oer the same renownd asteropaeus wore whose glittering margins raised with silver shine no vulgar gift eumelus shall be thine he said automedon at his command the corslet brought and gave it to his hand distinguishd by his friend his bosom glows with generous joy then menelaus rose the herald placed the sceptre in his hands and stilld the clamour of the shouting bands not without cause incensed at nestors son and inly grieving thus the king begun the praise of wisdom in thy youth obtaind an act so rash antilochus has staind robbd of my glory and my just reward to you o grecians be my wrong declared so not a leader shall our conduct blame or judge me envious of a rivals fame but shall not we ourselves the truth maintain what needs appealing in a fact so plain what greek shall blame me if i bid thee rise and vindicate by oath th illgotten prize rise if thou darest before thy chariot stand the driving scourge highlifted in thy hand and touch thy steeds and swear thy whole intent was but to conquer not to circumvent swear by that god whose liquid arms surround the globe and whose dread earthquakes heave the ground the prudent chief with calm attention heard then mildly thus excuse if youth have errd superior as thou art forgive the offence nor i thy equal or in years or sense thou knowst the errors of unripend age weak are its counsels headlong is its rage the prize i quit if thou thy wrath resign the mare or aught thou askst be freely thine ere i become from thy dear friendship torn hateful to thee and to the gods forsworn so spoke antilochus and at the word the mare contested to the king restored joy swells his soul as when the vernal grain lifts the green ear above the springing plain the fields their vegetable life renew and laugh and glitter with the morning dew such joy the spartans shining face oerspread and lifted his gay heart while thus he said still may our souls o generous youth agree tis now atrides turn to yield to thee rash heat perhaps a moment might control not break the settled temper of thy soul not but my friend tis still the wiser way to waive contention with superior sway for ah how few who should like thee offend like thee have talents to regain the friend to plead indulgence and thy fault atone suffice thy fathers merit and thy own generous alike for me the sire and son have greatly sufferd and have greatly done i yield that all may know my soul can bend nor is my pride preferrd before my friend he said and pleased his passion to command resignd the courser to noemons hand friend of the youthful chief himself content the shining charger to his vessel sent the golden talents merion next obtaind the fifth reward the double bowl remaind achilles this to reverend nestor bears and thus the purpose of his gift declares accept thou this o sacred sire he said in dear memorial of patroclus dead dead and for ever lost patroclus lies for ever snatchd from our desiring eyes take thou this token of a grateful heart though tis not thine to hurl the distant dart the quoit to toss the ponderous mace to wield or urge the race or wrestle on the field thy pristine vigour age has overthrown but left the glory of the past thy own he said and placed the goblet at his side with joy the venerable king replied wisely and well my son thy words have proved a senior honourd and a friend beloved too true it is deserted of my strength these witherd arms and limbs have faild at length oh had i now that force i felt of yore known through buprasium and the pylian shore victorious then in every solemn game ordaind to amarynces mighty name the brave epeians gave my glory way tolians pylians all resignd the day i quelld clytomedes in fights of hand and backward hurld ancus on the sand surpassd iphyclus in the swift career phyleus and polydorus with the spear the sons of actor won the prize of horse but won by numbers not by art or force for the famed twins impatient to survey prize after prize by nestor borne away sprung to their car and with united pains one lashd the coursers while one ruled the reins such once i was now to these tasks succeeds a younger race that emulate our deeds i yield alas to age who must not yield though once the foremost hero of the field go thou my son by generous friendship led with martial honours decorate the dead while pleased i take the gift thy hands present pledge of benevolence and kind intent rejoiced of all the numerous greeks to see not one but honours sacred age and me those due distinctions thou so well canst pay may the just gods return another day proud of the gift thus spake the full of days achilles heard him prouder of the praise the prizes next are orderd to the field for the bold champions who the caestus wield a stately mule as yet by toils unbroke of six years age unconscious of the yoke is to the circus led and firmly bound next stands a goblet massy large and round achilles rising thus let greece excite two heroes equal to this hardy fight who dare the foe with lifted arms provoke and rush beneath the longdescending stroke on whom apollo shall the palm bestow and whom the greeks supreme by conquest know this mule his dauntless labours shall repay the vanquishd bear the massy bowl away this dreadful combat great epes chose high oer the crowd enormous bulk he rose and seized the beast and thus began to say stand forth some man to bear the bowl away price of his ruin for who dares deny this mule my right the undoubted victor i others tis ownd in fields of battle shine but the first honours of this fight are mine for who excels in all then let my foe draw near but first his certain fortune know secure this hand shall his whole frame confound mash all his bones and all his body pound so let his friends be nigh a needful train to heave the batterd carcase off the plain the giant spoke and in a stupid gaze the host beheld him silent with amaze twas thou euryalus who durst aspire to meet his might and emulate thy sire the great mecistheus who in days of yore in theban games the noblest trophy bore the games ordaind dead oedipus to grace and singly vanquish the cadmean race him great tydides urges to contend warm with the hopes of conquest for his friend officious with the cincture girds him round and to his wrist the gloves of death are bound amid the circle now each champion stands and poises high in air his iron hands with clashing gauntlets now they fiercely close their crackling jaws reecho to the blows and painful sweat from all their members flows at length epeus dealt a weighty blow full on the cheek of his unwary foe beneath that ponderous arms resistless sway down droppd he nerveless and extended lay as a large fish when winds and waters roar by some huge billow dashd against the shore lies panting not less batterd with his wound the bleeding hero pants upon the ground to rear his fallen foe the victor lends scornful his hand and gives him to his friends whose arms support him reeling through the throng and dragging his disabled legs along nodding his head hangs down his shoulder oer his mouth and nostrils pour the clotted gore wrappd round in mists he lies and lost to thought his friends receive the bowl too dearly bought the third bold game achilles next demands and calls the wrestlers to the level sands a massy tripod for the victor lies of twice six oxen its reputed price and next the losers spirits to restore a female captive valued but at four scarce did the chief the vigorous strife propose when towerlike ajax and ulysses rose amid the ring each nervous rival stands embracing rigid with implicit hands close lockd above their heads and arms are mixd below their planted feet at distance fixd like two strong rafters which the builder forms proof to the wintry winds and howling storms their tops connected but at wider space fixd on the centre stands their solid base now to the grasp each manly body bends the humid sweat from every pore descends their bones resound with blows sides shoulders thighs swell to each gripe and bloody tumours rise nor could ulysses for his art renownd oerturn the strength of ajax on the ground nor could the strength of ajax overthrow the watchful caution of his artful foe while the long strife even tired the lookers on thus to ulysses spoke great telamon or let me lift thee chief or lift thou me prove we our force and jove the rest decree he said and straining heaved him off the ground with matchless strength that time ulysses found the strength to evade and where the nerves combine his ankle struck the giant fell supine ulysses following on his bosom lies shouts of applause run rattling through the skies ajax to lift ulysses next essays he barely stirrd him but he could not raise his knee lockd fast the foes attempt denied and grappling close they tumbled side by side defiled with honourable dust they roll still breathing strife and unsubdued of soul again they rage again to combat rise when great achilles thus divides the prize your noble vigour o my friends restrain nor weary out your generous strength in vain ye both have won let others who excel now prove that prowess you have proved so well the heros words the willing chiefs obey from their tired bodies wipe the dust away and clothed anew the following games survey and now succeed the gifts ordaind to grace the youths contending in the rapid race a silver urn that full six measures held by none in weight or workmanship excelld sidonian artists taught the frame to shine elaborate with artifice divine whence tyrian sailors did the prize transport and gave to thoas at the lemnian port from him descended good eunaeus heird the glorious gift and for lycaon spared to brave patroclus gave the rich reward now the same heros funeral rites to grace it stands the prize of swiftness in the race a wellfed ox was for the second placed and half a talent must content the last achilles rising then bespoke the train who hope the palm of swiftness to obtain stand forth and bear these prizes from the plain the hero said and starting from his place oilean ajax rises to the race ulysses next and he whose speed surpassd his youthful equals nestors son the last ranged in a line the ready racers stand pelides points the barrier with his hand all start at once oleus led the race the next ulysses measuring pace with pace behind him diligently close he sped as closely following as the running thread the spindle follows and displays the charms of the fair spinsters breast and moving arms graceful in motion thus his foe he plies and treads each footstep ere the dust can rise his glowing breath upon his shoulders plays the admiring greeks loud acclamations raise to him they give their wishes hearts and eyes and send their souls before him as he flies now three times turnd in prospect of the goal the panting chief to pallas lifts his soul assist o goddess thus in thought he prayd and present at his thought descends the maid buoyd by her heavenly force he seems to swim and feels a pinion lifting every limb all fierce and ready now the prize to gain unhappy ajax stumbles on the plain oerturnd by pallas where the slippery shore was cloggd with slimy dung and mingled gore the selfsame place beside patroclus pyre where late the slaughterd victims fed the fire besmeard with filth and blotted oer with clay obscene to sight the rueful racer lay the wellfed bull the second prize he shared and left the urn ulysses rich reward then grasping by the horn the mighty beast the baffled hero thus the greeks addressd accursed fate the conquest i forego a mortal i a goddess was my foe she urged her favourite on the rapid way and pallas not ulysses won the day thus sourly waild he sputtering dirt and gore a burst of laughter echoed through the shore antilochus more humorous than the rest takes the last prize and takes it with a jest why with our wiser elders should we strive the gods still love them and they always thrive ye see to ajax i must yield the prize he to ulysses still more aged and wise a green old age unconscious of decays that proves the hero born in better days behold his vigour in this active race achilles only boasts a swifter pace for who can match achilles he who can must yet be more than hero more than man the effect succeeds the speech pelides cries thy artful praise deserves a better prize nor greece in vain shall hear thy

made through the broad shield but at the corslet stayd not thus the foe his javelin aimd above the bucklers margin at the neck he drove but greece now trembling for her heros life bade share the honours and surcease the strife yet still the victors due tydides gains with him the sword and studded belt remains then hurld the hero thundering on the ground a mass of iron an enormous round whose weight and size the circling greeks admire rude from the furnace and but shaped by fire this mighty quoit ation wont to rear and from his whirling arm dismiss in air the giant by achilles slain he

beauteous youth majestic and divine he seemd fair offspring of some princely line now twilight veild the glaring face of day and clad the dusky fields in sober grey what time the herald and the hoary king their chariots stopping at the silver spring that circling ilus ancient marble flows allowd their mules and steeds a short repose through the dim shade the herald first espies a mans approach and thus to priam cries i mark some foes advance o king beware this hard adventure claims thy utmost care for much i fear destruction hovers nigh our state asks counsel is it best to fly or old and helpless at his feet to fall two wretched suppliants and for mercy call the afflicted monarch shiverd with despair pale grew his face and upright stood his hair sunk was his heart his colour went and came a sudden trembling shook his aged frame when hermes greeting touchd his royal hand and gentle thus accosts with kind demand say whither father when each mortal sight is seald in sleep thou wanderest through the night why roam thy mules and steeds the plains along through grecian foes so numerous and so strong what couldst thou hope should these thy treasures view these who with endless hate thy race pursue for what defence alas couldst thou provide thyself not young a weak old man thy guide yet suffer not thy soul to sink with dread from me no harm shall touch thy reverend head from greece ill guard thee too for in those lines the living image of my father shines thy words that speak benevolence of mind are true my son the godlike sire rejoind great are my hazards but the gods survey my steps and send thee guardian of my way hail and be blessd for scarce of mortal kind appear thy form thy feature and thy mind nor true are all thy words nor erring wide the sacred messenger of heaven replied but say conveyst thou through the lonely plains what yet most precious of thy store remains to lodge in safety with some friendly hand prepared perchance to leave thy native land or fliest thou nowwhat hopes can troy retain thy matchless son her guard and glory slain the king alarmd say what and whence thou art who search the sorrows of a parents heart and know so well how godlike hector died thus priam spoke and hermes thus replied you tempt me father and with pity touch on this sad subject you inquire too much oft have these eyes that godlike hector viewd in glorious fight with grecian blood embrued i saw him when like jove his flames he tossd on thousand ships and witherd half a host i saw but helpd not stern achilles ire forbade assistance and enjoyd the fire for him i serve of myrmidonian race one ship conveyd us from our native place polyctor is my sire an honourd name old like thyself and not unknown to fame of seven his sons by whom the lot was cast to serve our prince it fell on me the last to watch this quarter my adventure falls for with the morn the greeks attack your walls sleepless they sit impatient to engage and scarce their rulers check their martial rage if then thou art of stern pelides train the mournful monarch thus rejoind again ah tell me truly where oh where are laid my sons dear relics what befalls him dead have dogs dismemberd on the naked plains or yet unmangled rest his cold remains o favourd of the skies thus answered then the power that mediates between god and men nor dogs nor vultures have thy hector rent but whole he lies neglected in the tent this the twelfth evening since he rested there untouchd by worms untainted by the air still as auroras ruddy beam is spread round his friends tomb achilles drags the dead yet undisfigured or in limb or face all fresh he lies with every living grace majestical in death no stains are found oer all the corse and closed is every wound though many a wound they gave some heavenly care some hand divine preserves him ever fair or all the host of heaven to whom he led a life so grateful still regard him dead thus spoke to priam the celestial guide and joyful thus the royal sire replied blest is the man who pays the gods above the constant tribute of respect and love those who inhabit the olympian bower my son forgot not in exalted power and heaven that every virtue bears in mind even to the ashes of the just is kind but thou o generous youth this goblet take a pledge of gratitude for hectors sake and while the favouring gods our steps survey safe to pelides tent conduct my way to whom the latent god o king forbear to tempt my youth for apt is youth to err but can i absent from my princes sight take gifts in secret that must shun the light what from our masters interest thus we draw is but a licensed theft that scapes the law respecting him my soul abjures the offence and as the crime i dread the consequence thee far as argos pleased i could convey guard of thy life and partner of thy way on thee attend thy safety to maintain oer pathless forests or the roaring main he said then took the chariot at a bound and snatchd the reins and whirld the lash around before the inspiring god that urged them on the coursers fly with spirit not their own and now they reachd the naval walls and found the guards repasting while the bowls go round on these the virtue of his wand he tries and pours deep slumber on their watchful eyes then heaved the massy gates removed the bars and oer the trenches led the rolling cars unseen through all the hostile camp they went and now approachd pelides lofty tent on firs the roof was raised and coverd oer with reeds collected from the marshy shore and fenced with palisades a hall of state the work of soldiers where the hero sat large was the door whose wellcompacted strength a solid pinetree barrd of wondrous length scarce three strong greeks could lift its mighty weight but great achilles singly closed the gate this hermes such the power of gods set wide then swift alighted the celestial guide and thus revealdhear prince and understand thou owst thy guidance to no mortal hand hermes i am descended from above the king of arts the messenger of jove farewell to shun achilles sight i fly uncommon are such favours of the sky nor stand confessd to frail mortality now fearless enter and prefer thy prayers adjure him by his fathers silver hairs his son his mother urge him to bestow whatever pity that stern heart can know thus having said he vanishd from his eyes and in a moment shot into the skies the king confirmd from heaven alighted there and left his aged herald on the car with solemn pace through various rooms he went and found achilles in his inner tent there sat the hero alcimus the brave and great automedon attendance gave these served his person at the royal feast around at awful distance stood the rest unseen by these the king his entry made and prostrate now before achilles laid sudden a venerable sight appears embraced his knees and bathed his hands in tears those direful hands his kisses pressd embrued even with the best the dearest of his blood as when a wretch who conscious of his crime pursued for murder flies his native clime just gains some frontier breathless pale amazed all gaze all wonder thus achilles gazed thus stood the attendants stupid with surprise all mute yet seemd to question with their eyes each lookd on other none the silence broke till thus at last the kingly suppliant spoke ah think thou favourd of the powers divine think of thy fathers age and pity mine in me that fathers reverend image trace those silver hairs that venerable face his trembling limbs his helpless person see in all my equal but in misery yet now perhaps some turn of human fate expels him helpless from his peaceful state think from some powerful foe thou seest him fly and beg protection with a feeble cry yet still one comfort in his soul may rise he hears his son still lives to glad his eyes and hearing still may hope a better day may send him thee to chase that foe away no comfort to my griefs no hopes remain the best the bravest of my sons are slain yet what a race ere greece to ilion came the pledge of many a loved and loving dame nineteen one mother boredead all are dead how oft alas has wretched priam bled still one was left their loss to recompense his fathers hope his countrys last defence him too thy rage has slain beneath thy steel unhappy in his countrys cause he fell for him through hostile camps i bent my way for him thus prostrate at thy feet i lay large gifts proportiond to thy wrath i bear o hear the wretched and the gods revere think of thy father and this face behold see him in me as helpless and as old though not so wretched there he yields to me the first of men in sovereign misery thus forced to kneel thus grovelling to embrace the scourge and ruin of my realm and race suppliant my childrens murderer to implore and kiss those hands yet reeking with their gore these words soft pity in the chief inspire touchd with the dear remembrance of his sire then with his hand as prostrate still he lay the old mans cheek he gently turnd away now each by turns indulged the gush of woe and now the mingled tides together flow this low on earth that gently bending oer a father one and one a son deplore but great achilles different passions rend and now his sire he mourns and now his friend the infectious softness through the heroes ran one universal solemn shower began they bore as heroes but they felt as man satiate at length with unavailing woes from the high throne divine achilles rose the reverend monarch by the hand he raised on his white beard and form majestic gazed not unrelenting then serene began with words to soothe the miserable man alas what weight of anguish hast thou known unhappy prince thus guardless and alone to pass through foes and thus undaunted face the man whose fury has destroyd thy race heaven sure has armd thee with a heart of steel a strength proportiond to the woes you feel rise then let reason mitigate your care to mourn avails not man is born to bear such is alas the gods severe decree they only they are blest and only free two urns by joves high throne have ever stood the source of evil one and one of good from thence the cup of mortal man he fills blessings to these to those distributes ill to most he mingles both the wretch decreed to taste the bad unmixd is cursed indeed pursued by wrongs by meagre famine driven he wanders outcast both of earth and heaven the happiest taste not happiness sincere but find the cordial draught is dashd with care who more than peleus shone in wealth and power what stars concurring blessd his natal hour a realm a goddess to his wishes given graced by the gods with all the gifts of heaven one evil yet oertakes his latest day no race succeeding to imperial sway an only son and he alas ordaind to fall untimely in a foreign land see him in troy the pious care decline of his weak age to live the curse of thine thou too old man hast happier days beheld in riches once in children once excelld extended phrygia ownd thy ample reign and all fair lesbos blissful seats contain and all wide hellesponts unmeasured main but since the god his hand has pleased to turn and fill thy measure from his bitter urn what sees the sun but hapless heroes falls war and the blood of men surround thy walls what must be must be bear thy lot nor shed these unavailing sorrows oer the dead thou canst not call him from the stygian shore but thou alas mayst live to suffer more to whom the king o favourd of the skies here let me grow to earth since hector lies on the bare beach deprived of obsequies o give me hector to my eyes restore his corse and take the gifts i ask no more thou as thou mayst these boundless stores enjoy safe mayst thou sail and turn thy wrath from troy so shall thy pity and forbearance give a weak old man to see the light and live move me no more achilles thus replies while kindling anger sparkled in his eyes nor seek by tears my steady soul to bend to yield thy hector i myself intend for know from jove my goddessmother came old oceans daughter silverfooted dame nor comest thou but by heaven nor comest alone some god impels with courage not thy own no human hand the weighty gates unbarrd nor could the boldest of our youth have dared to pass our outworks or elude the guard cease lest neglectful of high joves command i show thee king thou treadst on hostile land release my knees thy suppliant arts give oer and shake the purpose of my soul no more the sire obeyd him trembling and oerawd achilles like a lion rushd abroad automedon and alcimus attend whom most he honourd since he lost his friend these to unyoke the mules and horses went and led the hoary herald to the tent next heapd on high the numerous presents bear great hectors ransom from the polishd car two splendid mantles and a carpet spread they leave to cover and enwrap the dead then call the handmaids with assistant toil to wash the body and anoint with oil apart from priam lest the unhappy sire provoked to passion once more rouse to ire the stern pelides and nor sacred age nor joves command should check the rising rage this done the garments oer the corse they spread achilles lifts it to the funeral bed then while the body on the car they laid he groans and calls on loved patroclus shade if in that gloom which never light must know the deeds of mortals touch the ghosts below o friend forgive me that i thus fulfil restoring hector heavens unquestiond will the gifts the father gave be ever thine to grace thy manes and adorn thy shrine he said and entering took his seat of state where full before him reverend priam sate to whom composed the godlike chief begun lo to thy prayer restored thy breathless son extended on the funeral couch he lies and soon as morning paints the eastern skies the sight is granted to thy longing eyes but now the peaceful hours of sacred night demand reflection and to rest invite nor thou o father thus consumed with woe the common cares that nourish life forego not thus did niobe of form divine a parent once whose sorrows equalld thine six youthful sons as many blooming maids in one sad day beheld the stygian shades those by apollos silver bow were slain these cynthias arrows stretchd upon the plain so was her pride chastised by wrath divine who matchd her own with bright latonas line but two the goddess twelve the queen enjoyd those boasted twelve the avenging two destroyd steepd in their blood and in the dust outspread nine days neglected lay exposed the dead none by to weep them to inhume them none for jove had turnd the nation all to stone the gods themselves at length relenting gave the unhappy race the honours of a grave herself a rock for such was heavens high will through deserts wild now pours a weeping rill where round the bed whence achelous springs the watery fairies dance in mazy rings there high on sipyluss shaggy brow she stands her own sad monument of woe the rock for ever lasts the tears for ever flow such griefs o king have other parents known remember theirs and mitigate thy own the care of heaven thy hector has appeard nor shall he lie unwept and uninterrd soon may thy aged cheeks in tears be drownd and all the eyes of ilion stream around he said and rising chose the victim ewe with silver fleece which his attendants slew the limbs they sever from the reeking hide with skill prepare them and in parts divide each on the coals the separate morsels lays and hasty snatches from the rising blaze with bread the glittering canisters they load which round the board automedon bestowd the chief himself to each his portion placed and each indulging shared in sweet repast when now the rage of hunger was repressd the wondering hero eyes his royal guest no less the royal guest the hero eyes his godlike aspect and majestic size here youthful grace and noble fire engage and there the mild benevolence of age thus gazing long the silence neither broke a solemn scene at length the father spoke permit me now beloved of jove to steep my careful temples in the dew of sleep for since the day that numberd with the dead my hapless son the dust has been my bed soft sleep a stranger to my weeping eyes my only food my sorrows and my sighs till now encouraged by the grace you give i share thy banquet and consent to live with that achilles bade prepare the bed with purple soft and shaggy carpets spread forth by the flaming lights they bend their way and place the couches and the coverings lay then he now father sleep but sleep not here consult thy safety and forgive my fear lest any argive at this hour awake to ask our counsel or our orders take approaching sudden to our opend tent perchance behold thee and our grace prevent should such report thy honourd person here the king of men the ransom might defer but say with speed if aught of thy desire remains unaskd what time the rites require to inter thy hector for so long we stay our slaughtering arm and bid the hosts obey if then thy will permit the monarch said to finish all due honours to the dead this of thy grace accord to thee are known the fears of ilion closed within her town and at what distance from our walls aspire the hills of ide and forests for the fire nine days to vent our sorrows i request the tenth shall see the funeral and the feast the next to raise his monument be given the twelfth we war if war be doomd by heaven this thy request replied the chief enjoy till then our arms suspend the fall of troy then gave his hand at parting to prevent the old mans fears and turnd within the tent where fair brises bright in blooming charms expects her hero with desiring arms but in the porch the king and herald rest sad dreams of care yet wandering in their breast now gods and men the gifts of sleep partake industrious hermes only was awake the kings return revolving in his mind to pass the ramparts and the watch to blind the power descending hoverd oer his head and sleepst thou father thus the vision said now dost thou sleep when hector is restored nor fear the grecian foes or grecian lord thy presence here should stern atrides see thy still surviving sons may sue for thee may offer all thy treasures yet contain to spare thy age and offer all in vain waked with the word the trembling sire arose and raised his friend the god before him goes he joins the mules directs them with his hand and moves in silence through the hostile land when now to xanthus yellow stream they drove xanthus immortal progeny of jove the winged deity forsook their view and in a moment to olympus flew now shed aurora round her saffron ray sprang through the gates of light and gave the day charged with the mournful load to ilion go the sage and king majestically slow cassandra first beholds from ilions spire the sad procession of her hoary sire then as the pensive pomp advanced more near her breathless brother stretched upon the bier a shower of tears oerflows her beauteous eyes alarming thus all ilion with her cries turn here your steps and here your eyes employ ye wretched daughters and ye sons of troy if eer ye rushd in crowds with vast delight to hail your hero glorious from the fight now meet him dead and let your sorrows flow your common triumph and your common woe in thronging crowds they issue to the plains nor man nor woman in the walls remains in every face the selfsame grief is shown and troy sends forth one universal groan at scas gates they meet the mourning wain hang on the wheels and grovel round the slain the wife and mother frantic with despair kiss his pale cheek and rend their scatterd hair thus wildly wailing at the gates they lay and there had sighd and sorrowd out the day but godlike priam from the chariot rose forbear he cried this violence of woes first to the palace let the car proceed then pour your boundless sorrows oer the dead the waves of people at his word divide slow rolls the chariot through the following tide even to the palace the sad pomp they wait they weep and place him on the bed of state a melancholy choir attend around with plaintive sighs and musics solemn sound alternately they sing alternate flow the obedient tears melodious in their woe while deeper sorrows groan from each full heart and nature speaks at every pause of art first to the corse the weeping consort flew around his neck her milkwhite arms she threw and oh my hector oh my lord she cries snatchd in thy bloom from these desiring eyes thou to the dismal realms for ever gone and i abandond desolate alone an only son once comfort of our pains sad product now of hapless love remains never to manly age that son shall rise or with increasing graces glad my eyes for ilion now her great defender slain shall sink a smoking ruin on the plain who now protects her wives with guardian care who saves her infants from the rage of war now hostile fleets must waft those infants oer those wives must wait them to a foreign shore thou too my son to barbarous climes shall go the sad companion of thy mothers woe driven hence a slave before the victors sword condemnd to toil for some inhuman lord or else some greek whose father pressd the plain or son or brother by great hector slain in hectors blood his vengeance shall enjoy and hurl thee headlong from the towers of troy for thy stern father never spared a foe thence all these tears and all this scene of woe thence many evils his sad parents bore his parents many but his consort more why gavst thou not to me thy dying hand and why received not i thy last command some word thou wouldst have spoke which sadly dear my soul might keep or utter with a tear which never never could be lost in air fixd in my heart and oft repeated there thus to her weeping maids she makes her moan her weeping handmaids echo groan for groan the mournful mother next sustains her part o thou the best the dearest to my heart of all my race thou most by heaven approved and by the immortals even in death beloved while all my other sons in barbarous bands achilles bound and sold to foreign lands this felt no chains but went a glorious ghost free and a hero to the stygian coast sentenced tis true by his inhuman doom thy noble corse was draggd around the tomb the tomb of him thy warlike arm had slain ungenerous insult impotent and vain yet glowst thou fresh with every living grace no mark of pain or violence of face rosy and fair as phbus silver bow dismissd thee gently to the shades below thus spoke the dame and melted into tears sad helen next in pomp of grief appears fast from the shining sluices of her eyes fall the round crystal drops while thus she cries ah dearest friend in whom the gods had joind the mildest manners with the bravest mind now twice ten years unhappy years are oer since paris brought me to the trojan shore o had i perishd ere that form divine seduced this soft this easy heart of mine yet was it neer my fate from thee to find a deed ungentle or a word unkind when others cursed the authoress of their woe thy pity checkd my sorrows in their flow if some proud brother eyed me with disdain or scornful sister with her sweeping train thy gentle accents softend all my pain for thee i mourn and mourn myself in thee the wretched source of all this misery the fate i caused for ever i bemoan sad helen has no friend now thou art gone through troys wide streets abandond shall i roam in troy deserted as abhorrd at home so spoke the fair with sorrowstreaming eye distressful beauty melts each standerby on all around the infectious sorrow grows but priam checkd the torrent as it rose perform ye trojans what the rites require and fell the forests for a funeral pyre twelve days nor foes nor secret ambush dread achilles grants these honours to the dead illustration funeral of hector he spoke and at his word the trojan train their mules and oxen harness to the wain pour through the gates and felld from idas crown roll back the gatherd forests to the town these toils continue nine succeeding days and high in air a sylvan structure raise but when the tenth fair morn began to shine forth to the pile was borne the man divine and placed aloft while all with streaming eyes beheld the flames and rolling smokes arise soon as aurora daughter of the dawn with rosy lustre streakd the dewy lawn again the mournful crowds surround the pyre and quench with wine the yet remaining fire the snowy bones his friends and brothers place with tears collected in a golden vase the golden vase in purple palls they rolld of softest texture and inwrought with gold last oer the urn the sacred earth they spread and raised the tomb memorial of the dead strong guards and spies till all the rites were done watchd from the rising to the setting sun all troy then moves to priams court again a solemn silent melancholy train assembled there from pious toil they rest and sadly shared the last sepulchral feast such honours ilion to her hero paid and peaceful slept the mighty hectors shade concluding note we have now passed through the iliad and seen the anger of achilles and the terrible effects of it at an end as that only was the subject of the poem and the nature of epic poetry would not permit our author to proceed to the event of the war it perhaps may be acceptable to the common reader to give a short account of what happened to troy and the chief actors in this poem after the conclusion of it i need not mention that troy was taken soon after the death of hector by the stratagem of the wooden horse the particulars of which are described by virgil in the second book of the neid achilles fell before troy by the hand of paris by the shot of an arrow in his heel as hector had prophesied at his death lib xxii the unfortunate priam was killed by pyrrhus the son of achilles ajax after the death of achilles had a contest with ulysses for the armour of vulcan but being defeated in his aim he slew himself through indignation helen after the death of paris married deiphobus his brother and at the taking of troy betrayed him in order to reconcile herself to menelaus her first husband who received her again into favour agamemnon at his return was barbarously murdered by gysthus at the instigation of clytemnestra his wife who in his absence had dishonoured his bed with gysthus diomed after the fall of troy was expelled his own country and scarce escaped with his life from his adulterous wife gial but at last was received by daunus in apulia and shared his kingdom it is uncertain how he died nestor lived in peace with his children in pylos his native country ulysses also after innumerable troubles by sea and land at last returned in safety to ithaca which is the subject of homers odyssey for what remains i beg to be excused from the ceremonies of taking leave at the end of my work and from embarrassing myself or others with any defences or apologies about it but instead of endeavouring to raise a vain monument to myself of the merits or difficulties of it which must be left to the world to truth and to posterity let me leave behind me a memorial of my friendship with one of the most valuable of men as well as finest writers of my age and country one who has tried and knows by his own experience how hard an undertaking it is to do justice to homer and one whom i am sure sincerely rejoices with me at the period of my labours to him therefore having brought this long work to a conclusion i desire to dedicate it and to have the honour and satisfaction of placing together in this manner the names of mr congreve

lib i end of the iliad footnotes what says archdeacon wilberforce is the natural root of loyalty as distinguished from such mere selfish desire of personal security as is apt to take its place in civilized times but that consciousness of a natural bond among the families of men which gives a fellowfeeling to whole clans and nations and thus enlists their affections in behalf of those timehonoured representatives of their ancient blood in whose success they feel a personal interest hence the delight when we recognize an act of nobility or justice in our hereditary princes tuque prior tu parce genus qui ducis olympo projice tela manu sanguis meus so strong is this feeling that it regains an engrafted influence even when history witnesses that vast convulsions have rent and weakened it and the celtic feeling towards the stuarts has been rekindled in our own days towards the granddaughter of george the third of hanover somewhat similar may be seen in the disposition to idolize those great lawgivers of mans race who have given expression in the immortal language of song to the deeper inspirations of our nature the thoughts of homer or of shakespere are the universal

basrelief the figures are usually in profile and in the epos all are characterized in the simplest manner in relief they are not grouped together but follow one another so homers heroes advance one by one in succession before us it has been remarked that the iliad is not definitively closed but that we are left to suppose something both to precede and to follow it the basrelief is equally without limit and may be continued ad infinitum either from before or behind on which account the ancients preferred for it such subjects as admitted of an indefinite extension sacrificial processions dances and lines of combatants and hence they also exhibit basreliefs on curved surfaces such as vases or the frieze of a rotunda where by the curvature the two ends are withdrawn from our sight and where while we advance one object appears as another disappears reading homer is very much like such a circuit the present object alone arresting our attention we lose sight of what precedes and do not

plausibly urged although the example of homer has since rendered some such formal enumeration of the forces engaged a common practice in epic poems descriptive of great warlike adventures still so minute a statistical detail can neither be considered as imperatively required nor perhaps such as would in ordinary cases suggest itself to the mind of a poet yet there is scarcely any portion of the iliad where both historical and internal evidence are more clearly in favour of a connection from the remotest period with the remainder of the work the composition of the catalogue whensoever it may have taken place necessarily presumes its authors acquaintance with a previously existing iliad it were impossible otherwise to account for the harmony observable in the recurrence of so vast a number of proper names most of them historically unimportant and not a few altogether fictitious or of so many geographical and genealogical details as are condensed in these few hundred lines and incidentally scattered over the thousands which follow equally inexplicable were the pointed allusions occurring in this episode to events narrated in the previous and subsequent text several of which

hundred and twenty men each were probably meant to be the largest in the fleet and those of philoctetes carrying fifty each the smallest the average would be eightyfive and thucydides supposes the troops to have rowed and navigated themselves and that very few besides the chiefs went as mere passengers or landsmen in short we have in the homeric descriptions the complete picture of an indian or african war canoe many of which are considerably larger than the largest scale assigned to those of the greeks if the total number of the greek ships be taken at twelve hundred according to thucydides

following elegant remarks of thirlwall greece vol i p seq well illustrate the character of the friendship subsisting between these two heroes one of the noblest and most amiable sides of the greek character is the readiness with which it lent itself to construct intimate and durable friendships and this is a feature no less prominent in the earliest than in later times it was indeed connected with the comparatively low estimation in which female society was held but the devotedness and constancy with which these attachments were maintained was not the less admirable and engaging the heroic companions whom we find celebrated partly by homer and partly in traditions which if not of equal antiquity were grounded on the same feeling seem to have but one heart and soul with scarcely a wish or object apart and only to live as they are always ready to die for one another it is true that the relation between them is not always one of perfect equality but this is a circumstance which while it often adds a peculiar charm to the poetical description detracts little from the dignity of the idea which it presents such were the friendships of hercules and iolaus of theseus and pirithous of orestes and pylades and though these may owe the greater part of their fame to the later epic or even dramatic poetry the moral groundwork undoubtedly subsisted in the period to which the traditions are referred the argument of the iliad mainly turns on the affection of achilles for patroclus whose love for the greater hero is only tempered by reverence for his higher birth and his unequalled prowess but the mutual regard which united idomeneus and meriones diomedes and sthenelus though as the persons themselves are less important it is kept more in the background is manifestly viewed by the poet in the same light the idea of a greek hero seems not to have been thought complete without such a brother in arms by his sidethirlwall greece vol i p seq as hungry wolves with raging appetite

credulity of subsequent ages zeus or jupiter is popularly to be taken as omnipotent no distinct empire is assigned to fate or fortune the will of the father of gods and men is absolute and uncontrollable this seems to be the true character of the homeric deity and it is very necessary that the student of greek literature should bear it constantly in mind a strong instance in the iliad itself to illustrate this position is the passage where jupiter laments to juno the approaching death of sarpedon alas me says he since it is fated moira that sarpedon dearest to me of men should be slain by patroclus the son of menoetius indeed my heart is divided within me while i ruminate it in my mind whether having snatched him up from out of the lamentable battle i should not at once place him alive in the fertile land of his own lycia or whether i should now destroy him by the hands of the son of menoetius to which juno answersdost thou mean to rescue from death a mortal man long since destined by fate palai pepromenon you may do itbut we the rest of the gods do not sanction it here it is clear from both speakers that although sarpedon is said to be fated to die jupiter might still

the difference of arrangement in the shield of hercules is altogether for the worse the natural consecution of the homeric images needs no exposition it constitutes in itself one of the beauties of the work the hesiodic images are huddled together without connection or congruity mars and pallas are awkwardly introduced among the centaurs and lapithae but the gap is wide indeed between them and

dolphins the fugitive fishes and the fisherman on the shore with his casting net are minutely represented as to the hesiodic images themselves the leading remark is that they catch at beauty by ornament and at sublimity by exaggeration and upon the untenable supposition of the genuineness of this poem there is this curious peculiarity that in the description of scenes of rustic peace the superiority of homer is decisivewhile in those of war and tumult it may be thought perhaps that the hesiodic poet has more than once the advantage this legend is one of the most pregnant and

trojans into the town he was slain by an arrow from the quiver of paris directed under the unerring auspices of apollo the greatest efforts were made by the trojans to possess themselves of the body which was however rescued and borne off to the grecian camp by the valour of ajax and ulysses thetis stole away the body just as the greeks were about to burn it with funeral honours and conveyed it away to a renewed life of immortality in the isle of leuke in the euxine astyanax ie the cityking or guardian it is amusing that plato who often finds fault with homer without reason should have copied this twaddling etymology into his cratylus this book has been closely imitated by virgil in his fifth book but it is almost useless to attempt a selection of passages for comparison thrice in order led this was a frequent rite at funerals the romans had the same custom which they called decursio plutarch states that alexander in after times renewed these same honours to the memory of achilles himself and swore literally and called orcus the god of oaths to witness see buttmann lexilog p o long expected by thy friends from whence art thou so late returnd for our defence do we behold thee wearied as we are with length of labours and with toils of war after so many funerals of thy own art thou restored to thy declining town but say what wounds are these what new disgrace deforms the manly features of thy face dryden xi like a thin smoke virgil georg iv in vain i reach my feeble hands to join in sweet embracesah no longer thine she said and from his eyes the fleeting fair retired like subtle smoke dissolved in air dryden so milton so eagerly the fiend oer bog oer steep through strait rough dense or rare with head hands wings or feet pursues his way and swims or sinks or wades or creeps or flies paradise lost ii an ancient forest for the work designd the shady covert of the savage kind the trojans found the sounding axe is placed firs pines and pitchtrees and the towring pride of forest ashes feel the fatal stroke and piercing wedges cleave the stubborn oak high trunks of trees felld from the steepy crown of the bare mountains roll with ruin down drydens virgil vi he vowed this was a very ancient custom the height of the tomb or pile was a great proof of the dignity of the deceased and the honour in which he was held on the prevalence of this cruel custom amongst the northern nations see mallet p and calls the spirit such was the custom anciently even at the roman funerals hail o ye holy manes hail again paternal ashes now revived in vain drydens virgil v virgil by making the boaster vanquished has drawn a better moral from this episode than homer the following lines deserve comparison the haughty dares in the lists appears walking he strides his head erected bears his nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wield and loud applauses echo through the field such dares was and such he strode along and drew the wonder of the gazing throng his brawny breast and ample chest he shows his lifted arms around his head he throws and deals in whistling air his empty blows his match is sought but through the trembling band no one dares answer to the proud demand presuming of his force with sparkling eyes already he devours the promised prize if none my matchless valour dares oppose how long shall dares wait his dastard foes drydens virgil v seq the gauntletfight thus ended from the shore his faithful friends unhappy dares bore his mouth and nostrils pourd a purple flood and pounded teeth came rushing with his blood drydens virgil v troilus is only once named in the iliad he was mentioned also in the cypriad but his youth beauty and untimely end made him an object of great interest with the subsequent poetsgrote i p milton has rivalled this passage describing the descent of gabriel paradise lost bk v seq down thither prone in flight he speeds and through the vast ethereal sky sails between worlds and worlds with steady wing now on the polar winds then with quick fan winnows the buxom air at once on th eastern cliff of paradise he lights and to his proper shape returns a seraph wingd like maias son he stood and shook his plumes that heavenly fragrance filld the circuit wide virgil n iv hermes obeys with golden pinions binds his flying feet and mounts the western winds and whether oer the seas or earth he flies with rapid force they bear him down the skies but first he grasps within his awful hand the mark of sovereign power his magic wand with this he draws the ghost from hollow graves with this he drives them from the stygian waves thus armd the god begins his airy racev and drives the racking clouds along the liquid space dryden in reference to the whole scene that follows the remarks of coleridge are well worth reading by a close study of life and by a true and natural mode of expressing everything homer was enabled to venture upon the most peculiar and difficult situations and to extricate himself from them with the completest success the whole scene between achilles and priam when the latter comes to the greek camp for the purpose of redeeming the body of hector is at once the most profoundly skilful and yet the simplest and most affecting passage in the iliad quinctilian has taken notice of the following speech of priam the rhetorical artifice of which is so transcendent that if genius did not often especially in oratory unconsciously fulfil the most subtle precepts of criticism we might be induced on this account alone to consider the last book of the iliad as what is called spurious in other words of later date than the rest of the poem observe the exquisite taste of priam in occupying the mind of achilles from the outset with the image of his father in gradually introducing the parallel of his own situation and lastly mentioning hectors name when he perceives that the hero is softened and then only in such a manner as to flatter the pride of the conqueror the ego deleeinoteros per and the apusato aecha geronta are not exactly like the tone of the earlier parts of the iliad they are almost too fine and pathetic the whole passage defies translation for there is that about the greek which has no name but which is of so fine and ethereal a subtlety that it can only be felt in the original and is lost in an attempt to transfuse it into another languagecoleridge p achilles ferocious treatment of the corpse of hector cannot but offend as referred to the modern standard of humanity the heroic age however must be judged by its own moral laws retributive vengeance on the dead as well as the living was a duty inculcated by the religion of those barbarous times which not only taught that evil inflicted on the author of evil was a solace to the injured man but made the welfare of the soul after death dependent on the fate of the body from which it had separated hence a denial of the rites essential to the souls admission into the more favoured regions of the lower world was a cruel punishment to the wanderer on the dreary shores of the infernal river the complaint of the ghost of patroclus to achilles of but a brief postponement of his own obsequies shows how efficacious their refusal to the remains of his destroyer must have been in satiating the thirst of revenge which even after death was supposed to torment the dwellers in hades hence before yielding up the body of hector to priam achilles asks pardon of patroclus for even this partial cession of his just rights of retributionmure vol i such was the fate of astyanax when troy was taken here from the towr by stern ulysses thrown andromache bewaild her infant son merricks tryphiodorus v the following observations of coleridge furnish a most gallant and interesting view of helens character few things are more interesting than to observe how the same hand that has given us the fury and inconsistency of achilles gives us also the consummate elegance and tenderness of helen she is through the iliad a genuine lady graceful in motion and speech noble in her associations full of remorse for a fault for which higher powers seem responsible yet grateful and affectionate towards those with whom that fault had committed her i have always thought the following speech in which helen laments hector and hints at her own invidious and unprotected situation in troy as almost the sweetest passage in the poem it is another striking instance of that refinement of feeling and softness of tone which so generally distinguish the last book of the iliad from the restclassic poets p seq and here we part with achilles at the moment best calculated to exalt and purify our impression of his character we had accompanied him through the effervescence undulations and final subsidence of his stormy passions we now leave him in repose and under the full influence of the more amiable affections while our admiration of his great qualities is chastened by the reflection that within a few short days the mighty being in whom they were united was himself to be suddenly cut off in the full vigour of their exercise the frequent and touching allusions interspersed throughout the iliad to the speedy termination of its heros course and the moral on the vanity of human life which they indicate are among the finest evidences of the spirit of ethic unity by which the whole framework of the poem is unitedmure vol i p cowper saysi cannot take my leave of this noble poem without expressing how much i am struck with the plain conclusion of it it is like the exit of a great man out of company whom he has entertained magnificently neither pompous nor familiar not contemptuous yet without much ceremony coleridge p considers the termination of
