english credits produced by judith boss start of the project gutenberg ebook riders to the sea produced by judith boss cover riders to the sea a play in one act by j m synge contents introduction riders to the sea introduction it must have been on synges second visit to the aran islands that he had the experience out of which was wrought what many believe to be his greatest play the scene of riders to the sea is laid in a cottage on inishmaan the middle and most interesting island of the aran group while synge was on inishmaan the story came to him of a man whose body had been washed up on the far away coast of donegal and who by reason of certain peculiarities of dress was suspected to be from the island in due course he was recognised as a native of inishmaan in exactly the manner described in the play and perhaps one of the most poignantly vivid passages in synges book on the aran islands relates the incident of his burial the other element in the story which synge introduces into the play is equally true many tales of second sight are to be heard among celtic races in fact they are so common as to arouse little or no wonder in the minds of the people it is just such a tale which there seems no valid reason for doubting that synge heard and that gave the title riders to the sea to his play it is the dramatists high distinction that he has simply taken the materials which lay ready to his hand and by the power of sympathy woven them with little modification into a tragedy which for dramatic irony and noble pity has no equal among its contemporaries great tragedy it is frequently claimed with some show of justice has perforce departed with the advance of modern life and its complicated tangle of interests and creature comforts a highly developed civilisation with its attendant specialisation of culture tends ever to lose sight of those elemental forces those primal emotions naked to wind and sky which are the stuff from which great drama is wrought by the artist but which as it would seem are rapidly departing from us it is only in the far places where solitary communion may be had with the elements that this dynamic life is still to be found continuously and it is accordingly thither that the dramatist who would deal with spiritual life disengaged from the environment of an intellectual maze must go for that experience which will beget in him inspiration for his art the aran islands from which synge gained his inspiration are rapidly losing that sense of isolation and selfdependence which has hitherto been their rare distinction and which furnished the motivation for synges masterpiece whether or not synge finds a successor it is none the less true that in english dramatic literature riders to the sea has an historic value which it would be difficult to overestimate in its accomplishment and its possibilities a writer in the manchester guardian shortly after synges death phrased it rightly when he wrote that it is the tragic masterpiece of our language in our time wherever it has been played in europe from galway to prague it has made the word tragedy mean something more profoundly stirring and cleansing to the spirit than it did the secret of the plays power is its capacity for standing afar off and mingling if we may say so sympathy with relentlessness there is a wonderful beauty of speech in the words of every character wherein the latent power of suggestion is almost unlimited in the big world the old people do be leaving things after them for their sons and children but in this place it is the young men do be leaving things behind for them that do be old in the quavering rhythm of these words there is poignantly present that quality of strangeness and remoteness in beauty which as we are coming to realise is the touchstone of celtic literary art however the very asceticism of the play has begotten a corresponding power which lifts synges work far out of the current of the irish literary revival and sets it high in a timeless atmosphere of universal action its characters live and die it is their virtue in life to be lonely and none but the lonely man in tragedy may be great he dies and then it is the virtue in life of the women mothers and wives and sisters to be great in their loneliness great as maurya the stricken mother is great in her final word michael has a clean burial in the far north by the grace of the almighty god bartley will have a fine coffin out of the white boards and a deep grave surely what more can we want than that no man at all can be living for ever and we must be satisfied the pity and the terror of it all have brought a great peace the peace that passeth understanding and it is because the play holds this timeless peace after the storm which has bowed down every character that riders to the sea may rightly take its place as the greatest modern tragedy in the english tongue edward j obrien february riders to the sea a play in one act first performed at the molesworth hall dublin february th persons maurya an old woman honor lavelle bartley her son w g fay cathleen her daughter sarah allgood nora a younger daughter emma vernon men and women scene an

the way the lightll not be on you nora sits down at the chimney corner with her back to the door maurya comes in very slowly without looking at the girls and goes over to her stool at the other side of the fire the cloth with the bread is still in her hand the girls look at each other and nora points to the bundle of bread cathleen after spinning for a momentyou didnt give him his bit of bread maurya begins to keen softly without turning round cathleen did you see him riding down maurya goes on keening cathleen a little impatientlygod forgive you isnt it a better thing to raise your voice and tell what you seen than to be making lamentation for a thing thats done did you see bartley im saying to you maurya with a weak voicemy hearts broken from this day cathleen as beforedid you see bartley maurya i seen the fearfulest thing cathleen leaves her wheel and looks outgod forgive you hes riding the mare now over the green head and the gray pony behind him maurya starts so that her

the fearfulest thing any person has seen since the day bride dara seen the dead man with the child in his arms cathleen and nora uah they crouch down in front of the old woman at the fire nora tell us what it is you seen maurya i went down to the spring well and i stood there saying a prayer to myself then bartley came along and he riding on the red mare with the gray pony behind him she puts up her hands as if to hide something from her eyes the son of god spare us nora cathleen what is it you seen maurya i seen michael himself cathleen speaking softlyyou did not mother it wasnt michael you

first on the red mare and i tried to say god speed you but something choked the words in my throat he went by quickly and the blessing of god on you says he and i could say nothing i looked up then and i crying at the gray pony and there was michael upon itwith fine clothes on him and new shoes on his feet cathleen begins to keenits destroyed we are from this day its destroyed surely nora didnt the young priest say the almighty god wouldnt leave her destitute with no son living maurya in a low voice but clearlyits little the like of him knows of the sea bartley will be lost now and let you call in eamon and make me a good coffin out of the white boards for i wont live after them ive had a husband and a husbands father and six sons in this housesix fine men though it was a hard birth i had with every one of them and they coming to the worldand some of them were found and some of them were not found but theyre gone now the lot of them there were stephen and shawn were lost in the great wind and found after in the bay of gregory of the golden mouth and carried up the two of them on the one plank and in by that door she pauses for a moment the girls start as if they heard something through the door that is half open behind them nora in a whisperdid you hear that cathleen did you hear a noise in the northeast cathleen in a whispertheres some one after crying out by the seashore maurya continues without hearing anythingthere was sheamus and his father and his own father again were lost in a dark night and not a stick or sign was seen of them when the sun went up there was patch after was drowned out of a curagh that turned over i was sitting here with bartley and he a baby lying on my two knees and i seen two women and three women and four women coming in and they crossing themselves and not saying a word i looked out then and there were men coming after them and they holding a thing in the half of a red sail and water dripping out of itit was a dry day noraand leaving a track to the door she pauses again with her hand stretched out towards the door it opens softly and old women begin to come in crossing themselves on the threshold and kneeling down in front of the stage with red petticoats over their heads maurya half in a dream to cathleenis it patch or michael or what is it at all cathleen michael is after being found in the far north and when he is found there how could he be here in this place maurya there does be a power of young men floating round in the sea and what way would they know if it was michael they had or another man like him for when a man is nine days in the sea and the wind blowing its hard set his own mother would be to say what man was it cathleen its michael god spare him for theyre after sending us a bit of his clothes from the far north she reaches out and hands maurya the clothes that belonged to michael maurya stands up slowly and takes them into her hands nora looks out nora theyre carrying a thing among them and theres water dripping out of it and leaving a track by the big stones cathleen in a whisper to the women who have come inis it bartley it is one of the women it is surely god rest his soul two younger women come in and pull out the table then men carry in the body of bartley laid on a plank with a bit of a sail over it and lay it on the table cathleen to the women as they are doing sowhat way was he drowned one of the women the gray pony knocked him into the sea and he was washed out where there is a great surf on the white rocks maurya has gone over and knelt down at the head of the table the women are keening softly and swaying themselves with a slow movement cathleen and nora kneel at the other end of the table the men kneel near the door maurya raising her head and speaking as if she did not see the people around hertheyre all gone now and there isnt anything more the sea can do to me ill have no call now to be up crying and praying when the wind breaks from the south and you can hear the surf is in the east and the surf is in the west making a great stir with the two noises and they hitting one on the other ill have no call now to be going down and getting holy water in the dark nights after samhain and i wont care what way the sea is when the other women will be keening to nora give me the holy water nora theres a small sup still on the dresser nora gives it to her maurya drops michaels clothes across bartleys feet and sprinkles the holy water over himit isnt that i havent prayed for you bartley to the almighty god it isnt that i havent said prayers in the dark night till you wouldnt know what ild be saying but its a great rest ill have now and its time surely its a great rest ill have now and great sleeping in the long nights after samhain if its only a bit of wet flour we do have to eat and maybe a fish that would be stinking she kneels down again crossing herself and saying prayers under her breath cathleen to an old manmaybe yourself and eamon would make a coffin when the sun rises we have fine white boards herself bought god help her thinking michael would be found and i have a new cake you can eat while youll be working the old man looking at the boardsare there nails with them cathleen there are not colum we didnt think of the nails another man its a great wonder she wouldnt think of the nails and all the coffins shes seen made already cathleen its getting old she is and broken maurya stands up again very slowly and spreads out the pieces of michaels clothes beside the body sprinkling them with the last of the holy water nora in a whisper to cathleenshes quiet now and easy but the day michael was drowned you could hear her crying out from this to the spring well its fonder she was of michael and would any one have thought that cathleen slowly and clearlyan old woman will be soon tired with anything she will do and isnt it nine days herself is after crying and keening and making great sorrow in the house maurya puts the empty cup mouth downwards on the table and lays her hands together on bartleys feettheyre all together this time and the end is come may the almighty god have mercy on bartleys soul and on michaels soul and on the souls of sheamus and patch and stephen and shawn bending her head and may he have mercy on my soul nora and on the soul of every one is left living in the world she pauses and the keen rises a little more loudly from the women then sinks away maurya continuingmichael has a clean burial in the far north by the grace of the almighty god bartley will have a fine coffin out of the white boards and a deep grave surely what more can we want than that no man at all can be living for ever and we must be satisfied she kneels down again and the curtain falls slowly
