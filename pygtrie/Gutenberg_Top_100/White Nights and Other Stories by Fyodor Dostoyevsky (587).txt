notes from underground part i underground part ii propos of the wet snow a faint heart a christmas tree and a wedding polzunkov a little hero mr prohartchin white nights a sentimental story from the diary of a dreamer first night it was a wonderful night such a night as is only possible when we are young dear reader the sky was so starry so bright that looking at it one could not help asking oneself whether illhumoured and capricious people could live under such a sky that is a youthful question too dear reader very youthful but may the lord put it more frequently into your heart speaking of capricious and illhumoured people i cannot help recalling my moral condition all that day from early morning i had been oppressed by a strange despondency it suddenly seemed to me that i was lonely that every one was forsaking me and going away from me of course any one is entitled to ask who every one was for though i had been living almost eight years in petersburg i had hardly an acquaintance but what did i want with acquaintances i was acquainted with all petersburg as it was that was why i felt as though they were all deserting me when all petersburg packed up and went to its summer villa i felt afraid of being left alone and for three whole days i wandered about the town in profound dejection not knowing what to do with myself whether i walked in the nevsky went to the gardens or sauntered on the embankment there was not one face of those i had been accustomed to meet at the same time and place all the year they of course do not know me but i know them i know them intimately i have almost made a study of their faces and am delighted when they are gay and downcast when they are under a cloud i have almost struck up a friendship with one old man whom i meet every blessed day at the same hour in fontanka such a grave pensive countenance he is always whispering to himself and brandishing his left arm while in his right hand he holds a long gnarled stick with a gold knob he even notices me and takes a warm interest in me if i happen not to be at a certain time in the same spot in fontanka i am certain he feels disappointed that is how it is that we almost bow to each other especially when we are both in good humour the other day when we had not seen each other for two days and met on the third we were actually touching our hats but realizing in time dropped our hands and passed each other with a look of interest i know the houses too as i walk along they seem to run forward in the streets to look out at me from every window and almost to say goodmorning how do you do i am quite well thank god and i am to have a new storey in may or how are you i am being redecorated tomorrow or i was almost burnt down and had such a fright and so on i have my favourites among them some are dear friends one of them intends to be treated by the architect this summer i shall go every day on purpose to see that the operation is not a failure god forbid but i shall never forget an incident with a very pretty little house of a light pink colour it was such a charming little brick house it looked so hospitably at me and so proudly at its ungainly neighbours that my heart rejoiced whenever i happened to pass it suddenly last week i walked along the street and when i looked at my friend i heard a plaintive they are painting me yellow the villains the barbarians they had spared nothing neither columns nor cornices and my poor little friend was as yellow as a canary it almost made me bilious and to this day i have not had the courage to visit my poor disfigured friend painted the colour of the celestial empire so now you understand reader in what sense i am acquainted with all petersburg i have mentioned already that i had felt worried for three whole days before i guessed the cause of my uneasiness and i felt ill at ease in the streetthis one had gone and that one had gone and what had become of the otherand at home i did not feel like myself either for two evenings i was puzzling my brains to think what was amiss in my corner why i felt so uncomfortable in it and in perplexity i scanned my grimy green walls my ceiling covered with a spiders web the growth of which matrona has so successfully encouraged i looked over all my furniture examined every chair wondering whether the trouble lay there for if one chair is not standing in the same position as it stood the day before i am not myself i looked at the window but it was all in vain i was not a bit the better for it i even bethought me to send for matrona and was giving her some fatherly admonitions in regard to the spiders web and sluttishness in general but she simply stared at me in amazement and went away without saying a word so that the spiders web is comfortably hanging in its place to this day i only at last this morning realized what was wrong aie why they are giving me the slip and making off to their summer villas forgive the triviality of the expression but i am in no mood for fine language for everything that had been in petersburg had gone or was going away for the holidays for every respectable gentleman of dignified appearance who took a cab was at once transformed in my eyes into a respectable head of a household who after his daily duties were over was making his way to the bosom of his family to the summer villa for all the passersby had now quite a peculiar air which seemed to say to every one they met we are only here for the moment gentlemen and in another two hours we shall be going off to the summer villa if a window opened after delicate fingers white as snow had tapped upon the pane and the head of a pretty girl was thrust out calling to a streetseller with pots of flowersat once on the spot i fancied that those flowers were being bought not simply in order to enjoy the flowers and the spring in stuffy town lodgings but because they would all be very soon moving into the country and could take the flowers with them what is more i made such progress in my new peculiar sort of investigation that i could distinguish correctly from the mere air of each in what summer villa he was living the inhabitants of kamenny and aptekarsky islands or of the peterhof road were marked by the studied elegance of their manner their fashionable summer suits and the fine carriages in which they drove to town visitors to pargolovo and places further away impressed one at first sight by their reasonable and dignified air the tripper to krestovsky island could be recognized by his look of irrepressible gaiety if i chanced to meet a long procession of waggoners walking lazily with the reins in their hands beside waggons loaded with regular mountains of furniture tables chairs ottomans and sofas and domestic utensils of all sorts frequently with a decrepit cook sitting on the top of it all guarding her masters property as though it were the apple of her eye or if i saw boats heavily loaded with household goods crawling along the neva or fontanka to the black river or the islandsthe waggons and the boats were multiplied tenfold a hundredfold in my eyes i fancied that everything was astir and moving everything was going in regular caravans to the summer villas it seemed as though petersburg threatened to become a wilderness so that at last i felt ashamed mortified and sad that i had nowhere to go for the holidays and no reason to go away i was ready to go away with every waggon to drive off with every gentleman of respectable appearance who took a cab but no oneabsolutely no oneinvited me it seemed they had forgotten me as though really i were a stranger to them i took long walks succeeding as i usually did in quite forgetting where i was when i suddenly found myself at the city gates instantly i felt lighthearted and i passed the barrier and walked between cultivated fields and meadows unconscious of fatigue and feeling only all over as though a burden were falling off my soul all the passersby gave me such friendly looks that they seemed almost greeting me they all seemed so pleased at something they were all smoking cigars every one of them and i felt pleased as i never had before it was as though i had suddenly found myself in italyso strong was the effect of nature upon a halfsick townsman like me almost stifling between city walls there is something inexpressibly touching in nature round petersburg when at the approach of spring she puts forth all her might all the powers bestowed on her by heaven when she breaks into leaf decks herself out and spangles herself with flowers somehow i cannot help being reminded of a frail consumptive girl at whom one sometimes looks with compassion sometimes with sympathetic love whom sometimes one simply does not notice though suddenly in one instant she becomes as though by chance inexplicably lovely and exquisite and impressed and intoxicated one cannot help asking oneself what power made those sad pensive eyes flash with such fire what summoned the blood to those pale wan cheeks what bathed with passion those soft features what set that bosom heaving what so suddenly called strength life and beauty into the poor girls face making it gleam with such a smile kindle with such bright sparkling laughter you look round you seek for some one you conjecture but the moment passes and next day you meet maybe the same pensive and preoccupied look as before the same pale face the same meek and timid movements and even signs of remorse traces of a mortal anguish and regret for the fleeting distraction and you grieve that the momentary beauty has faded so soon never to return that it flashed upon you so treacherously so vainly grieve because you had not even time to love her and yet my night was better than my day this was how it happened i came back to the town very late and it had struck ten as i was going towards my lodgings my way lay along the canal embankment where at that hour you never meet a soul it is true that i live in a very remote part of the town i walked along singing for when i am happy i am always humming to myself like every happy man who has no friend or acquaintance with whom to share his joy suddenly i had a most unexpected adventure leaning on the canal railing stood a woman with her elbows on the rail she was apparently looking with great attention at the muddy water of the canal she was wearing a very charming yellow hat and a jaunty little black mantle shes a girl and i am sure she is dark i thought she did not seem to hear my footsteps and did not even stir when i passed by with bated breath and loudly throbbing heart strange i thought she must be deeply absorbed in something and all at once i stopped as though petrified i heard a muffled sob yes i was not mistaken the girl was crying and a minute later i heard sob after sob good heavens my heart sank and timid as i was with women yet this was such a moment i turned took a step towards her and should certainly have pronounced the word madam if i had not known that that exclamation has been uttered a thousand times in every russian society novel it was only that reflection stopped me but while i was seeking for a word the girl came to herself looked round started cast down her eyes and slipped by me along the embankment i at once followed her but she divining this left the embankment crossed the road and walked along the pavement i dared not cross the street after her my heart was fluttering like a captured bird all at once a chance came to my aid along the same side of the pavement there suddenly came into sight not far from the girl a gentleman in evening dress of dignified years though by no means of dignified carriage he was staggering and cautiously leaning against the wall the girl flew straight as an arrow with the timid haste one sees in all girls who do not want any one to volunteer to accompany them home at night and no doubt the staggering gentleman would not have pursued her if my good luck had not prompted him suddenly without a word to any one the gentleman set off and flew full speed in pursuit of my unknown lady she was racing like the wind but the staggering gentleman was overtakingovertook her the girl uttered a shriek and i bless my luck for the excellent knotted stick which happened on that occasion to be in my right hand in a flash i was on the other side of the street in a flash the obtrusive gentleman had taken in the position had grasped the irresistible argument fallen back without a word and only when we were very far away protested against my action in rather vigorous language but his words hardly reached us give me your arm i said to the girl and he wont dare to annoy us further she took my arm without a word still trembling with excitement and terror oh obtrusive gentleman how i blessed you at that moment i stole a glance at her she was very charming and darki had guessed right on her black eyelashes there still glistened a tearfrom her recent terror or her former griefi dont know but there was already a gleam of a smile on her lips she too stole a glance at me faintly blushed and looked down there you see why did you drive me away if i had been here nothing would have happened but i did not know you i thought that you too why do you know me now a little here for instance why are you trembling oh you are right at the first guess i answered delighted that my girl had intelligence that is never out of place in company with beauty yes from the first glance you have guessed the sort of man you have to do with precisely i am shy with women i am agitated i dont deny it as much so as you were a minute ago when that gentleman alarmed you i am in some alarm now its like a dream and i never guessed even in my sleep that i should ever talk with any woman what really yes if my arm trembles it is because it has never been held by a pretty little hand like yours i am a complete stranger to women that is i have never been used to them you see i am alone i dont even know how to talk to them here i dont know now whether i have not said something silly to you tell me frankly i assure you beforehand that i am not quick to take offence no nothing nothing quite the contrary and if you insist on my speaking frankly i will tell you that women like such timidity and if you want to know more i like it too and i wont drive you away till i get home you will make me i said breathless with delight lose my timidity and then farewell to all my chances chances what chancesof what thats not so nice i beg your pardon i am sorry it was a slip of the tongue but how can you expect one at such a moment to have no desire to be liked eh well yes but do for goodness sake be kind think what i am here i am twentysix and i have never seen any one how can i speak well tactfully and to the point it will seem better to you when i have told you everything openly i dont know how to be silent when my heart is speaking well never mind believe me not one woman never never no acquaintance of any sort and i do nothing but dream every day that at last i shall meet some one oh if only you knew how often i have been in love in that way how with whom why with no one with an ideal with the one i dream of in my sleep i make up regular romances in my dreams ah you dont know me its true of course i have met two or three women but what sort of women were they they were all landladies that but i shall make you laugh if i tell you that i have several times thought of speaking just simply speaking to some aristocratic lady in the street when she is alone i need hardly say speaking to her of course timidly respectfully passionately telling her that i am perishing in solitude begging her not to send me away saying that i have no chance of making the acquaintance of any woman impressing upon her that it is a positive duty for a woman not to repulse so timid a prayer from such a luckless man as me that in fact all i ask is that she should say two or three sisterly words with sympathy should not repulse me at first sight should take me on trust and listen to what i say should laugh at me if she likes encourage me say two words to me only two words even though we never meet again afterwards but you are laughing however that is why i am telling you dont be vexed i am only laughing at your being your own enemy and if you had tried you would have succeeded perhaps even though it had been in the street the simpler the better no kindhearted woman unless she were stupid or still more vexed about something at the moment could bring herself to send you away without those two words which you ask for so timidly but what am i saying of course she would take you for a madman i was judging by myself i know a good deal about other peoples lives oh thank you i cried you dont know what you have done for me now i am glad i am glad but tell me how did you find out that i was the sort of woman with whom well whom you think worthy of attention and friendship in fact not a landlady as you say what made you decide to come up to me what made me but you were alone that gentleman was too insolent its night you must admit that it was a duty no no i mean before on the other sideyou know you meant to come up to me on the other side really i dont know how to answer i am afraid to do you know i have been happy today i walked along singing i went out into the country i have never had such happy moments you perhaps it was my fancy forgive me for referring to it i fancied you were crying and i could not bear to hear it it made my heart ache oh my goodness surely i might be troubled about you surely there was no harm in feeling brotherly compassion for you i beg your pardon i said compassion well in short surely you would not be offended at my involuntary impulse to go up to you stop thats enough dont talk of it said the girl looking down and pressing my hand its my fault for having spoken of it but i am glad i was not mistaken in you but here i am home i must go down this turning its two steps from here goodbye thank you surely surely you dont mean that we shall never see each other again surely this is not to be the end you see said the girl laughing at first you only wanted two words and now however i wont say anything perhaps we shall meet i shall come here tomorrow i said oh forgive me i am already making demands yes you are not very patient you are almost insisting listen listen i interrupted her forgive me if i tell you something else i tell you what i cant help coming here tomorrow i am a dreamer i have so little real life that i look upon such moments as this now as so rare that i cannot help going over such moments again in my dreams i shall be dreaming of you all night a whole week a whole year i shall certainly come here tomorrow just here to this place just at the same hour and i shall be happy remembering today this place is dear to me already i have already two or three such places in petersburg i once shed tears over memories like you who knows perhaps you were weeping ten minutes ago over some memory but forgive me i have forgotten myself again perhaps you have once been particularly happy here very good said the girl perhaps i will come here tomorrow too at ten oclock i see that i cant forbid you the fact is i have to be here dont imagine that i am making an appointment with you i tell you beforehand that i have to be here on my own account but well i tell you straight out i dont mind if you do come to begin with something unpleasant might happen as it did today but never mind that in short i should simply like to see you to say two words to you only mind you must not think the worse of me now dont think i make appointments so lightly i shouldnt make it except that but let that be my secret only a compact beforehand a compact speak tell me tell me all beforehand i agree to anything i am ready for anything i cried delighted i answer for myself i will be obedient respectful you know me its just because i do know you that i ask you to come tomorrow said the girl laughing i know you perfectly but mind you will come on the condition in the first place only be good do what i askyou see i speak frankly you wont fall in love with me thats impossible i assure you i am ready for friendship heres my hand but you mustnt fall in love with me i beg you i swear i cried gripping her hand hush dont swear i know you are ready to flare up like gunpowder dont think ill of me for saying so if only you knew i too have no one to whom i can say a word whose advice i can ask of course one does not look for an adviser in the street but you are an exception i know you as though we had been friends for twenty years you wont deceive me will you you will see the only thing is i dont know how i am going to survive the next twentyfour hours sleep soundly goodnight and remember that i have trusted you already but you exclaimed so nicely just now surely one cant be held responsible for every feeling even for brotherly sympathy do you know that was so nicely said that the idea struck me at once that i might confide in you for gods sake do but about what what is it wait till tomorrow meanwhile let that be a secret so much the better for you it will give it a faint flavour of romance perhaps i will tell you tomorrow and perhaps not i will talk to you a little more beforehand we will get to know each other better oh yes i will tell you all about myself tomorrow but what has happened it is as though a miracle had befallen me my god where am i come tell me arent you glad that you were not angry and did not drive me away at the first moment as any other woman would have done in two minutes you have made me happy for ever yes happy who knows perhaps you have reconciled me with myself solved my doubts perhaps such moments come upon me but there i will tell you all about it tomorrow you shall know everything everything very well i consent you shall begin agreed goodbye till tomorrow till tomorrow and we parted i walked about all night i could not make up my mind to go home i was so happy tomorrow second night well so you have survived she said pressing both my hands ive been here for the last two hours you dont know what a state i have been in all day i know i know but to business do you know why i have come not to talk nonsense as i did yesterday i tell you what we must behave more sensibly in future i thought a great deal about it last night in what wayin what must we be more sensible i am ready for my part but really nothing more sensible has happened to me in my life than this now really in the first place i beg you not to squeeze my hands so secondly i must tell you that i spent a long time thinking about you and feeling doubtful today and how did it end how did it end the upshot of it is that we must begin all over again because the conclusion i reached today was that i dont know you at all that i behaved like a baby last night like a little girl and of course the fact of it is that its my soft heart that is to blamethat is i sang my own praises as one always does in the end when one analyses ones conduct and therefore to correct my mistake ive made up my mind to find out all about you minutely but as i have no one from whom i can find out anything you must tell me everything fully yourself well what sort of man are you come make hastebegintell me your whole history my history i cried in alarm my history but who has told you i have a history i have no history then how have you lived if you have no history she interrupted laughing absolutely without any history i have lived as they say keeping myself to myself that is utterly alonealone entirely alone do you know what it means to be alone but how alone do you mean you never saw any one oh no i see people of course but still i am alone why do you never talk to any one strictly speaking with no one who are you then explain yourself stay i guess most likely like me you have a grandmother she is blind and will never let me go anywhere so that i have almost forgotten how to talk and when i played some pranks two years ago and she saw there was no holding me in she called me up and pinned my dress to hers and ever since we sit like that for days together she knits a stocking though shes blind and i sit beside her sew or read aloud to herits such a queer habit here for two years ive been pinned to her good heavens what misery but no i havent a grandmother like that well if you havent why do you sit at home listen do you want to know the sort of man i am yes yes in the strict sense of the word in the very strictest sense of the word very well i am a type type type what sort of type cried the girl laughing as though she had not had a chance of laughing for a whole year yes its very amusing talking to you look heres a seat let us sit down no one is passing here no one will hear us andbegin your history for its no good your telling me i know you have a history only you are concealing it to begin with what is a type a type a type is an original its an absurd person i said infected by her childish laughter its a character listen do you know what is meant by a dreamer a dreamer indeed i should think i do know i am a dreamer myself sometimes as i sit by grandmother all sorts of things come into my head why when one begins dreaming one lets ones fancy run away with onewhy i marry a chinese prince though sometimes it is a good thing to dream but goodness knows especially when one has something to think of apart from dreams added the girl this time rather seriously excellent if you have been married to a chinese emperor you will quite understand me come listen but one minute i dont know your name yet at last you have been in no hurry to think of it oh my goodness it never entered my head i felt quite happy as it was my name is nastenka nastenka and nothing else nothing else why is not that enough for you you insatiable person not enough on the contrary its a great deal a very great deal nastenka you kind girl if you are nastenka for me from the first quite so well well listen nastenka now for this absurd history i sat down beside her assumed a pedantically serious attitude and began as though reading from a manuscript there are nastenka though you may not know it strange nooks in petersburg it seems as though the same sun as shines for all petersburg people does not peep into those spots but some other different new one bespoken expressly for those nooks and it throws a different light on everything in these corners dear nastenka quite a different life is lived quite unlike the life that is surging round us but such as perhaps exists in some unknown realm not among us in our serious overserious time well that life is a mixture of something purely fantastic fervently ideal with something alas nastenka dingily prosaic and ordinary not to say incredibly vulgar foo good heavens what a preface what do i hear listen nastenka it seems to me i shall never be tired of calling you nastenka let me tell you that in these corners live strange peopledreamers the dreamerif you want an exact definitionis not a human being but a creature of an intermediate sort for the most part he settles in some inaccessible corner as though hiding from the light of day once he slips into his corner he grows to it like a snail or anyway he is in that respect very much like that remarkable creature which is an animal and a house both at once and is called a tortoise why do you suppose he is so fond of his four walls which are invariably painted green grimy dismal and reeking unpardonably of tobacco smoke why is it that when this absurd gentleman is visited by one of his few acquaintances and he ends by getting rid of all his friends why does this absurd person meet him with such embarrassment changing countenance and overcome with confusion as though he had only just committed some crime within his four walls as though he had been forging counterfeit notes or as though he were writing verses to be sent to a journal with an anonymous letter in which he states that the real poet is dead and that his friend thinks it his sacred duty to publish his things why tell me nastenka why is it conversation is not easy between the two friends why is there no laughter why does no lively word fly from the tongue of the perplexed newcomer who at other times may be very fond of laughter lively words conversation about the fair sex and other cheerful subjects and why does this friend probably a new friend and on his first visitfor there will hardly be a second and the friend will never come againwhy is the friend himself so confused so tonguetied in spite of his wit if he has any as he looks at the downcast face of his host who in his turn becomes utterly helpless and at his wits end after gigantic but fruitless efforts to smooth things over and enliven the conversation to show his knowledge of polite society to talk too of the fair sex and by such humble endeavour to please the poor man who like a fish out of water has mistakenly come to visit him why does the gentleman all at once remembering some very necessary business which never existed suddenly seize his hat and hurriedly make off snatching away his hand from the warm grip of his host who was trying his utmost to show his regret and retrieve the lost position why does the friend chuckle as he goes out of the door and swear never to come and see this queer creature again though the queer creature is really a very good fellow and at the same time he cannot refuse his imagination the little diversion of comparing the queer fellows countenance during their conversation with the expression of an unhappy kitten treacherously captured roughly handled frightened and subjected to all sorts of indignities by children till utterly crestfallen it hides away from them under a chair in the dark and there must needs at its leisure bristle up spit and wash its insulted face with both paws and long afterwards look angrily at life and nature and even at the bits saved from the masters dinner for it by the sympathetic housekeeper listen interrupted nastenka who had listened to me all the time in amazement opening her eyes and her little mouth listen i dont know in the least why it happened and why you ask me such absurd questions all i know is that this adventure must have happened word for word to you doubtless i answered with the gravest face well since there is no doubt about it go on said nastenka because i want very much to know how it will end you want to know nastenka what our hero that is ifor the hero of the whole business was my humble selfdid in his corner you want to know why i lost my head and was upset for the whole day by the unexpected visit of a friend you want to know why i was so startled why i blushed when the door of my room was opened why i was not able to entertain my visitor and why i was crushed under the weight of my own hospitality why yes yes answered nastenka thats the point listen you describe it all splendidly but couldnt you perhaps describe it a little less splendidly you talk as though you were reading it out of a book nastenka i answered in a stern and dignified voice hardly able to keep from laughing dear nastenka i know i describe splendidly but excuse me i dont know how else to do it at this moment dear nastenka at this moment i am like the spirit of king solomon when after lying a thousand years under seven seals in his urn those seven seals were at last taken off at this moment nastenka when we have met at last after such a long separationfor i have known you for ages nastenka because i have been looking for some one for ages and that is a sign that it was you i was looking for and it was ordained that we should meet nowat this moment a thousand valves have opened in my head and i must let myself flow in a river of words or i shall choke and so i beg you not to interrupt me nastenka but listen humbly and obediently or i will be silent no no no not at all go on i wont say a word i will continue there is my friend nastenka one hour in my day which i like extremely that is the hour when almost all business work and duties are over and every one is hurrying home to dinner to lie down to rest and on the way all are cogitating on other more cheerful subjects relating to their evenings their nights and all the rest of their free time at that hour our herofor allow me nastenka to tell my story in the third person for one feels awfully ashamed to tell it in the first personand so at that hour our hero who had his work too was pacing along after the others but a strange feeling of pleasure set his pale rather crumpledlooking face working he looked not with indifference on the evening glow which was slowly fading on the cold petersburg sky when i say he looked i am lying he did not look at it but saw it as it were without realizing as though tired or preoccupied with some other more interesting subject so that he could scarcely spare a glance for anything about him he was pleased because till next day he was released from business irksome to him and happy as a schoolboy let out from the classroom to his games and mischief take a look at him nastenka you will see at once that joyful emotion has already had an effect on his weak nerves and morbidly excited fancy you see he is thinking of something of dinner do you imagine of the evening what is he looking at like that is it at that gentleman of dignified appearance who is bowing so picturesquely to the lady who rolls by in a carriage drawn by prancing horses no nastenka what are all those trivialities to him now he is rich now with his own individual life he has suddenly become rich and it is not for nothing that the fading sunset sheds its farewell gleams so gaily before him and calls forth a swarm of impressions from his warmed heart now he hardly notices the road on which the tiniest details at other times would strike him now the goddess of fancy if you have read zhukovsky dear nastenka has already with fantastic hand spun her golden warp and begun weaving upon it patterns of marvellous magic lifeand who knows maybe her fantastic hand has borne him to the seventh crystal heaven far from the excellent granite pavement on which he was walking his way try stopping him now ask him suddenly where he is standing now through what streets he is goinghe will probably remember nothing neither where he is going nor where he is standing now and flushing with vexation he will certainly tell some lie to save appearances that is why he starts almost cries out and looks round with horror when a respectable old lady stops him politely in the middle of the pavement and asks her way frowning with vexation he strides on scarcely noticing that more than one passerby smiles and turns round to look after him and that a little girl moving out of his way in alarm laughs aloud gazing openeyed at his broad meditative smile and gesticulations but fancy catches up in its playful flight the old woman the curious passersby and the laughing child and the peasants spending their nights in their barges on fontanka our hero let us suppose is walking along the canalside at that moment and capriciously weaves every one and everything into the canvas like a fly in a spiders web and it is only after the queer fellow has returned to his comfortable den with fresh stores for his mind to work on has sat down and finished his dinner that he comes to himself when matrona who waits upon himalways thoughtful and depressedclears the table and gives him his pipe he comes to himself then and recalls with surprise that he has dined though he has absolutely no notion how it has happened it has grown dark in the room his soul is sad and empty the whole kingdom of fancies drops to pieces about him drops to pieces without a trace without a sound floats away like a dream and he cannot himself remember what he was dreaming but a vague sensation faintly stirs his heart and sets it aching some new desire temptingly tickles and excites his fancy and imperceptibly evokes a swarm of fresh phantoms stillness reigns in the little room imagination is fostered by solitude and idleness it is faintly smouldering faintly simmering like the water with which old matrona is making her coffee as she moves quietly about in the kitchen close by now it breaks out spasmodically and the book picked up aimlessly and at random drops from my dreamers hand before he has reached the third page his imagination is again stirred and at work and again a new world a new fascinating life opens vistas before him a fresh dreamfresh happiness a fresh rush of delicate voluptuous poison what is real life to him to his corrupted eyes we live you and i nastenka so torpidly slowly insipidly in his eyes we are all so dissatisfied with our fate so exhausted by our life and truly see how at first sight everything is cold morose as though illhumoured among us poor things thinks our dreamer and it is no wonder that he thinks it look at these magic phantasms which so enchantingly so whimsically so carelessly and freely group before him in such a magic animated picture in which the most prominent figure in the foreground is of course himself our dreamer in his precious person see what varied adventures what an endless swarm of ecstatic dreams you ask perhaps what he is dreaming of why ask thatwhy of everything of the lot of the poet first unrecognized then crowned with laurels of friendship with hoffmann st bartholomews night of diana vernon of playing the hero at the taking of kazan by ivan vassilyevitch of clara mowbray of effie deans of the council of the prelates and huss before them of the rising of the dead in robert the devil do you remember the music it smells of the churchyard of minna and brenda of the battle of berezina of the reading of a poem at countess v ds of danton of cleopatra ei suoi amanti of a little house in kolomna of a little home of ones own and beside one a dear creature who listens to one on a winters evening opening her little mouth and eyes as you are listening to me now my angel no nastenka what is there what is there for him voluptuous sluggard in this life for which you and i have such a longing he thinks that this is a poor pitiful life not foreseeing that for him too maybe sometime the mournful hour may strike when for one day of that pitiful life he would give all his years of phantasy and would give them not only for joy and for happiness but without caring to make distinctions in that hour of sadness remorse and unchecked grief but so far that threatening has not arrivedhe desires nothing because he is superior to all desire because he has everything because he is satiated because he is the artist of his own life and creates it for himself every hour to suit his latest whim and you know this fantastic world of fairyland is so easily so naturally created as though it were not a delusion indeed he is ready to believe at some moments that all this life is not suggested by feeling is not mirage not a delusion of the imagination but that it is concrete real substantial why is it nastenka why is it at such moments one holds ones breath why by what sorcery through what incomprehensible caprice is the pulse quickened does a tear start from the dreamers eye while his pale moist cheeks glow while his whole being is suffused with an inexpressible sense of consolation why is it that whole sleepless nights pass like a flash in inexhaustible gladness and happiness and when the dawn gleams rosy at the window and daybreak floods the gloomy room with uncertain fantastic light as in petersburg our dreamer worn out and exhausted flings himself on his bed and drops asleep with thrills of delight in his morbidly overwrought spirit and with a weary sweet ache in his heart yes nastenka one deceives oneself and unconsciously believes that real true passion is stirring ones soul one unconsciously believes that there is something living tangible in ones immaterial dreams and is it delusion here love for instance is bound up with all its fathomless joy all its torturing agonies in his bosom only look at him and you will be convinced would you believe looking at him dear nastenka that he has never known her whom he loves in his ecstatic dreams can it be that he has only seen her in seductive visions and that this passion has been nothing but a dream surely they must have spent years hand in hand togetheralone the two of them casting off all the world and each uniting his or her life with the others surely when the hour of parting came she must have lain sobbing and grieving on his bosom heedless of the tempest raging under the sullen sky heedless of the wind which snatches and bears away the tears from her black eyelashes can all of that have been a dreamand that garden dejected forsaken run wild with its little mossgrown paths solitary gloomy where they used to walk so happily together where they hoped grieved loved loved each other so long so long and so fondly and that queer ancestral house where she spent so many years lonely and sad with her morose old husband always silent and splenetic who frightened them while timid as children they hid their love from each other what torments they suffered what agonies of terror how innocent how pure was their love and how i need hardly say nastenka malicious people were and good heavens surely he met her afterwards far from their native shores under alien skies in the hot south in the divinely eternal city in the dazzling splendour of the ball to the crash of music in a palazzo it must be in a palazzo drowned in a sea of lights on the balcony wreathed in myrtle and roses where recognizing him she hurriedly removes her mask and whispering i am free flings herself trembling into his arms and with a cry of rapture clinging to one another in one instant they forget their sorrow and their parting and all their agonies and the gloomy house and the old man and the dismal garden in that distant land and the seat on which with a last passionate kiss she tore herself away from his arms numb with anguish and despair oh nastenka you must admit that one would start betray confusion and blush like a schoolboy who has just stuffed in his pocket an apple stolen from a neighbours garden when your uninvited visitor some stalwart lanky fellow a festive soul fond of a joke opens your door and shouts out as though nothing were happening my dear boy i have this minute come from pavlovsk my goodness the old count is dead unutterable happiness is close at handand people arrive from pavlovsk finishing my pathetic appeal i paused pathetically i remembered that i had an intense desire to force myself to laugh for i was already feeling that a malignant demon was stirring within me that there was a lump in my throat that my chin was beginning to twitch and that my eyes were growing more and more moist i expected nastenka who listened to me opening her clever eyes would break into her childish irrepressible laugh and i was already regretting that i had gone so far that i had unnecessarily described what had long been simmering in my heart about which i could speak as though from a written account of it because i had long ago passed judgment on myself and now could not resist reading it making my confession without expecting to be understood but to my surprise she was silent waiting a little then she faintly pressed my hand and with timid sympathy asked surely you havent lived like that all your life all my life nastenka i answered all my life and it seems to me i shall go on so to the end no that wont do she said uneasily that must not be and so maybe i shall spend all my life beside grandmother do you know it is not at all good to live like that i know nastenka i know i cried unable to restrain my feelings longer and i realize now more than ever that i have lost all my best years and now i know it and feel it more painfully from recognizing that god has sent me you my good angel to tell me that and show it now that i sit beside you and talk to you it is strange for me to think of the future for in the futurethere is loneliness again again this musty useless life and what shall i have to dream of when i have been so happy in reality beside you oh may you be blessed dear girl for not having repulsed me at first for enabling me to say that for two evenings at least i have lived oh no no cried nastenka and tears glistened in her eyes no it mustnt be so any more we must not part like that what are two evenings oh nastenka nastenka do you know how far you have reconciled me to myself do you know now that i shall not think so ill of myself as i have at some moments do you know that maybe i shall leave off grieving over the crime and sin of my life for such a life is a crime and a sin and do not imagine that i have been exaggerating anythingfor goodness sake dont think that nastenka for at times such misery comes over me such misery because it begins to seem to me at such times that i am incapable of beginning a life in real life because it has seemed to me that i have lost all touch all instinct for the actual the real because at last i have cursed myself because after my fantastic nights i have moments of returning sobriety which are awful meanwhile you hear the whirl and roar of the crowd in the vortex of life around you you hear you see men living in reality you see that life for them is not forbidden that their life does not float away like a dream like a vision that their life is being eternally renewed eternally youthful and not one hour of it is the same as another while fancy is so spiritless monotonous to vulgarity and easily scared the slave of shadows of the idea the slave of the first cloud that shrouds the sun and overcasts with depression the true petersburg heart so devoted to the sunand what is fancy in depression one feels that this inexhaustible fancy is weary at last and worn out with continual exercise because one is growing into manhood outgrowing ones old ideals they are being shattered into fragments into dust if there is no other life one must build one up from the fragments and meanwhile the soul longs and craves for something else and in vain the dreamer rakes over his old dreams as though seeking a spark among the embers to fan them into flame to warm his chilled heart by the rekindled fire and to rouse up in it again all that was so sweet that touched his heart that set his blood boiling drew tears from his eyes and so luxuriously deceived him do you know nastenka the point i have reached do you know that i am forced now to celebrate the anniversary of my own sensations the anniversary of that which was once so sweet which never existed in realityfor this anniversary is kept in memory of those same foolish shadowy dreamsand to do this because those foolish dreams are no more because i have nothing to earn them with you know even dreams do not come for nothing do you know that i love now to recall and visit at certain dates the places where i was once happy in my own way i love to build up my present in harmony with the irrevocable past and i often wander like a shadow aimless sad and dejected about the streets and crooked lanes of petersburg what memories they are to remember for instance that here just a year ago just at this time at this hour on this pavement i wandered just as lonely just as dejected as today and one remembers that then ones dreams were sad and though the past was no better one feels as though it had somehow been better and that life was more peaceful that one was free from the black thoughts that haunt one now that one was free from the gnawing of consciencethe gloomy sullen gnawing which now gives me no rest by day or by night and one asks oneself where are ones dreams and one shakes ones head and says how rapidly the years fly by and again one asks oneself what has one done with ones years where have you buried your best days have you lived or not look one says to oneself look how cold the world is growing some more years will pass and after them will come gloomy solitude then will come old age trembling on its crutch and after it misery and desolation your fantastic world will grow pale your dreams will fade and die and will fall like the yellow leaves from the trees oh nastenka you know it will be sad to be left alone utterly alone and to have not even anything to regretnothing absolutely nothing for all that you have lost all that all was nothing stupid simple nullity there has been nothing but dreams come dont work on my feelings any more said nastenka wiping away a tear which was trickling down her cheek now its over now we shall be two together now whatever happens to me we will never part listen i am a simple girl i have not had much education though grandmother did get a teacher for me but truly i understand you for all that you have described i have been through myself when grandmother pinned me to her dress of course i should not have described it so well as you have i am not educated she added timidly for she was still feeling a sort of respect for my pathetic eloquence and lofty style but i am very glad that you have been quite open with me now i know you thoroughly all of you and do you know what i want to tell you my history too all without concealment and after that you must give me advice you are a very clever man will you promise to give me advice ah nastenka i cried though i have never given advice still less sensible advice yet i see now that if we always go on like this that it will be very sensible and that each of us will give the other a great deal of sensible advice well my pretty nastenka what sort of advice do you want tell me frankly at this moment i am so gay and happy so bold and sensible that it wont be difficult for me to find words no no nastenka interrupted laughing i dont only want sensible advice i want warm brotherly advice as though you had been fond of me all your life agreed nastenka agreed i cried delighted and if i had been fond of you for twenty years i couldnt have been fonder of you than i am now your hand said nastenka here it is said i giving her my hand and so let us begin my history nastenkas history half my story you know alreadythat is you know that i have an old grandmother if the other half is as brief as that i interrupted laughing be quiet and listen first of all you must agree not to interrupt me or else perhaps i shall get in a muddle come listen quietly i have an old grandmother i came into her hands when i was quite a little girl for my father and mother are dead it must be supposed that grandmother was once richer for now she recalls better days she taught me french and then got a teacher for me when i was fifteen and now i am seventeen we gave up having lessons it was at that time that i got into mischief what i did i wont tell you its enough to say that it wasnt very important but grandmother called me to her one morning and said that as she was blind she could not look after me she took a pin and pinned my dress to hers and said that we should sit like that for the rest of our lives if of course i did not become a better girl in fact at first it was impossible to get away from her i had to work to read and to study all beside grandmother i tried to deceive her once and persuaded fekla to sit in my place fekla is our charwoman she is deaf fekla sat there instead of me grandmother was asleep in her armchair at the time and i went off to see a friend close by well it ended in trouble grandmother woke up while i was out and asked some questions she thought i was still sitting quietly in my place fekla saw that grandmother was asking her something but could not tell what it was she wondered what to do undid the pin and ran away at this point nastenka stopped and began laughing i laughed with her she left off at once i tell you what dont you laugh at grandmother i laugh because its funny what can i do since grandmother is like that but yet i am fond of her in a way oh well i did catch it that time i had to sit down in my place at once and after that i was not allowed to stir oh i forgot to tell you that our house belongs to us that is to grandmother it is a little wooden house with three windows as old as grandmother herself with a little upper storey well there moved into our upper storey a new lodger then you had an old lodger i observed casually yes of course answered nastenka and one who knew how to hold his tongue better than you do in fact he hardly ever used his tongue at all he was a dumb blind lame driedup little old man so that at last he could not go on living he died so then we had to find a new lodger for we could not live without a lodgerthe rent together with grandmothers pension is almost all we have but the new lodger as luck would have it was a young man a stranger not of these parts as he did not haggle over the rent grandmother accepted him and only afterwards she asked me tell me nastenka what is our lodger likeis he young or old i did not want to lie so i told grandmother that he wasnt exactly young and that he wasnt old and is he pleasant looking asked grandmother again i did not want to tell a lie yes he is pleasant looking grandmother i said and grandmother said oh what a nuisance what a nuisance i tell you this grandchild that you may not be looking after him what times these are why a paltry lodger like this and he must be pleasant looking too it was very different in the old days grandmother was always regretting the old daysshe was younger in old days and the sun was warmer in old days and cream did not turn so sour in old daysit was always the old days i would sit still and hold my tongue and think to myself why did grandmother suggest it to me why did she ask whether the lodger was young and goodlooking but that was all i just thought it began counting my stitches again went on knitting my stocking and forgot all about it well one morning the lodger came in to see us he asked about a promise to paper his rooms one thing led to another grandmother was talkative and she said go nastenka into my bedroom and bring me my reckoner i jumped up at once i blushed all over i dont know why and forgot i was sitting pinned to grandmother instead of quietly undoing the pin so that the lodger should not seei jumped so that grandmothers chair moved when i saw that the lodger knew all about me now i blushed stood still as though i had been shot and suddenly began to cryi felt so ashamed and miserable at that minute that i didnt know where to look grandmother called out what are you waiting for and i went on worse than ever when the lodger saw saw that i was ashamed on his account he bowed and went away at once after that i felt ready to die at the least sound in the passage its the lodger i kept thinking i stealthily undid the pin in case but it always turned out not to be he never came a fortnight passed the lodger sent word through fyokla that he had a great number of french books and that they were all good books that i might read so would not grandmother like me to read them that i might not be dull grandmother agreed with gratitude but kept asking if they were moral books for if the books were immoral it would be out of the question one would learn evil from them and what should i learn grandmother what is there written in them ah she said whats described in them is how young men seduce virtuous girls how on the excuse that they want to marry them they carry them off from their parents houses how afterwards they leave these unhappy girls to their fate and they perish in the most pitiful way i read a great many books said grandmother and it is all so well described that one sits up all night and reads them on the sly so mind you dont read them nastenka said she what books has he sent they are all walter scotts novels grandmother walter scotts novels but stay isnt there some trick about it look hasnt he stuck a loveletter among them no grandmother i said there isnt a loveletter but look under the binding they sometimes stuff it under the bindings the rascals no grandmother there is nothing under the binding well thats all right so we began reading walter scott and in a month or so we had read almost half then he sent us more and more he sent us pushkin too so that at last i could not get on without a book and left off dreaming of how fine it would be to marry a chinese prince thats how things were when i chanced one day to meet our lodger on the stairs grandmother had sent me to fetch something he stopped i blushed and he blushed he laughed though said goodmorning to me asked after grandmother and said well have you read the books i answered that i had which did you like best he asked i said ivanhoe and pushkin best of all and so our talk ended for that time a week later i met him again on the stairs that time grandmother had not sent me i wanted to get something for myself it was past two and the lodger used to come home at that time goodafternoon said he i said goodafternoon too arent you dull he said sitting all day with your grandmother when he asked that i blushed i dont know why i felt ashamed and again i felt offendedi suppose because other people had begun to ask me about that i wanted to go away without answering but i hadnt the strength listen he said you are a good girl excuse my speaking to you like that but i assure you that i wish for your welfare quite as much as your grandmother have you no friends that you could go and visit i told him i hadnt any that i had had no friend but mashenka and she had gone away to pskov listen he said would you like to go to the theatre with me to the theatre what about grandmother but you must go without your grandmothers knowing it he said no i said i dont want to deceive grandmother goodbye well goodbye he answered and said nothing more only after dinner he came to see us sat a long time talking to grandmother asked her whether she ever went out anywhere whether she had acquaintances and suddenly said i have taken a box at the opera for this evening they are giving the barber of seville my friends meant to go but afterwards refused so the ticket is left on my hands the barber of seville cried grandmother why the same they used to act in old days yes its the same barber he said and glanced at me i saw what it meant and turned crimson and my heart began throbbing with suspense to be sure i know it said grandmother why i took the part of rosina myself in old days at a private performance so wouldnt you like to go today said the lodger or my ticket will be wasted by all means let us go said grandmother why shouldnt we and my nastenka here has never been to the theatre my goodness what joy we got ready at once put on our best clothes and set off though grandmother was blind still she wanted to hear the music besides she is a kind old soul what she cared most for was to amuse me we should never have gone of ourselves what my impressions of the barber of seville were i wont tell you but all that evening our lodger looked at me so nicely talked so nicely that i saw at once that he had meant to test me in the morning when he proposed that i should go with him alone well it was joy i went to bed so proud so gay my heart beat so that i was a little feverish and all night i was raving about the barber of seville i expected that he would come and see us more and more often after that but it wasnt so at all he almost entirely gave up coming he would just come in about once a month and then only to invite us to the theatre we went twice again only i wasnt at all pleased with that i saw that he was simply sorry for me because i was so hardly treated by grandmother and that was all as time went on i grew more and more restless i couldnt sit still i couldnt read i couldnt work sometimes i laughed and did something to annoy grandmother at another time i would cry at last i grew thin and was very nearly ill the opera season was over and our lodger had quite given up coming to see us whenever we metalways on the same staircase of coursehe would bow so silently so gravely as though he did not want to speak and go down to the front door while i went on standing in the middle of the stairs as red as a cherry for all the blood rushed to my head at the sight of him now the end is near just a year ago in may the lodger came to us and said to grandmother that he had finished his business here and that he must go back to moscow for a year when i heard that i sank into a chair half dead grandmother did not notice anything and having informed us that he should be leaving us he bowed and went away what was i to do i thought and thought and fretted and fretted and at last i made up my mind next day he was to go away and i made up my mind to end it all that evening when grandmother went to bed and so it happened i made up all my clothes in a parcelall the linen i neededand with the parcel in my hand more dead than alive went upstairs to our lodger i believe i must have stayed an hour on the staircase when i opened his door he cried out as he looked at me he thought i was a ghost and rushed to give me some water for i could hardly stand up my heart beat so violently that my head ached and i did not know what i was doing when i recovered i began by laying my parcel on his bed sat down beside it hid my face in my hands and went into floods of tears i think he understood it all at once and looked at me so sadly that my heart was torn listen he began listen nastenka i cant do anything i am a poor man for i have nothing not even a decent berth how could we live if i were to marry you we talked a long time but at last i got quite frantic i said i could not go on living with grandmother that i should run away from her that i did not want to be pinned to her and that i would go to moscow if he liked because i could not live without him shame and pride and love were all clamouring in me at once and i fell on the bed almost in convulsions i was so afraid of a refusal he sat for some minutes in silence then got up came up to me and took me by the hand listen my dear good nastenka listen i swear to you that if i am ever in a position to marry you shall make my happiness i assure you that now you are the only one who could make me happy listen i am going to moscow and shall be there just a year i hope to establish my position when i come back if you still love me i swear that we will be happy now it is impossible i am not able i have not the right to promise anything well i repeat if it is not within a year it will certainly be some time that is of course if you do not prefer any one else for i cannot and dare not bind you by any sort of promise that was what he said to me and next day he went away we agreed together not to say a word to grandmother that was his wish well my history is nearly finished now just a year has past he has arrived he has been here three days and and and what i cried impatient to hear the end and up to now has not shown himself answered nastenka as though screwing up all her courage theres no sign or sound of him here she stopped paused for a minute bent her head and covering her face with her hands broke into such sobs that it sent a pang to my heart to hear them i had not in the least expected such a dnouement nastenka i began timidly in an ingratiating voice nastenka for goodness sake dont cry how do you know perhaps he is not here yet he is he is nastenka repeated he is here and i know it we made an agreement at the time that evening before he went away when we said all that i have told you and had come to an understanding then we came out here for a walk on this embankment it was ten oclock we sat on this seat i was not crying then it was sweet to me to hear what he said and he said that he would come to us directly he arrived and if i did not refuse him then we would tell grandmother about it all now he is here i know it and yet he does not come and again she burst into tears good god can i do nothing to help you in your sorrow i cried jumping up from the seat in utter despair tell me nastenka wouldnt it be possible for me to go to him would that be possible she asked suddenly raising her head no of course not i said pulling myself up but i tell you what write a letter no thats impossible i cant do that she answered with decision bending her head and not looking at me how impossiblewhy is it impossible i went on clinging to my idea but nastenka it depends what sort of letter there are letters and letters and ah nastenka i am right trust to me trust to me i will not give you bad advice it can all be arranged you took the first stepwhy not now i cant i cant it would seem as though i were forcing myself on him ah my good little nastenka i said hardly able to conceal a smile no no you have a right to in fact because he made you a promise besides i can see from everything that he is a man of delicate feeling that he behaved very well i went on more and more carried away by the logic of my own arguments and convictions how did he behave he bound himself by a promise he said that if he married at all he would marry no one but you he gave you full liberty to refuse him at once under such circumstances you may take the first step you have the right you are in the privileged positionif for instance you wanted to free him from his promise listen how would you write write what this letter i tell you how i would write dear sir must i really begin like that dear sir you certainly must though after all i dont know i imagine well well what next dear siri must apologize for but no theres no need to apologize the fact itself justifies everything write simply i am writing to you forgive me my impatience but i have been happy for a whole year in hope am i to blame for being unable to endure a day of doubt now now that you have come perhaps you have changed your mind if so this letter is to tell you that i do not repine nor blame you i do not blame you because i have no power over your heart such is my fate you are an honourable man you will not smile or be vexed at these impatient lines remember they are written by a poor girl that she is alone that she has no one to direct her no one to advise her and that she herself could never control her heart but forgive me that a doubt has stolenif only for one instantinto my heart you are not capable of insulting even in thought her who so loved and so loves you yes yes thats exactly what i was thinking cried nastenka and her eyes beamed with delight oh you have solved my difficulties god has sent you to me thank you thank you what for what for for gods sending me i answered looking delighted at her joyful little face why yes for that too ah nastenka why one thanks some people for being alive at the same time with one i thank you for having met me for my being able to remember you all my life well enough enough but now i tell you what listen we made an agreement then that as soon as he arrived he would let me know by leaving a letter with some good simple people of my acquaintance who know nothing about it or if it were impossible to write a letter to me for a letter does not always tell everything he would be here at ten oclock on the day he arrived where we had arranged to meet i know he has arrived already but now its the third day and theres no sign of him and no letter its impossible for me to get away from grandmother in the morning give my letter tomorrow to those kind people i spoke to you about they will send it on to him and if there is an answer you bring it tomorrow at ten oclock but the letter the letter you see you must write the letter first so perhaps it must all be the day after tomorrow the letter said nastenka a little confused the letter but but she did not finish at first she turned her little face away from me flushed like a rose and suddenly i felt in my hand a letter which had evidently been written long before all ready and sealed up a familiar sweet and charming reminiscence floated through my mind r oro s isi n ana i began rosina we both hummed together i almost embracing her with delight while she blushed as only she could blush and laughed through the tears which gleamed like pearls on her black eyelashes come enough enough goodbye now she said speaking rapidly here is the letter here is the address to which you are to take it goodbye till we meet again till tomorrow she pressed both my hands warmly nodded her head and flew like an arrow down her side street i stood still for a long time following her with my eyes till tomorrow till tomorrow was ringing in my ears as she vanished from my sight third night today was a gloomy rainy day without a glimmer of sunlight like the old age before me i am oppressed by such strange thoughts such gloomy sensations questions still so obscure to me are crowding into my brainand i seem to have neither power nor will to settle them its not for me to settle all this today we shall not meet yesterday when we said goodbye the clouds began gathering over the sky and a mist rose i said that tomorrow it would be a bad day she made no answer she did not want to speak against her wishes for her that day was bright and clear not one cloud should obscure her happiness if it rains we shall not see each other she said i shall not come i thought that she would not notice todays rain and yet she has not come yesterday was our third interview our third white night but how fine joy and happiness makes any one how brimming over with love the heart is one seems longing to pour out ones whole heart one wants everything to be gay everything to be laughing and how infectious that joy is there was such a softness in her words such a kindly feeling in her heart towards me yesterday how solicitous and friendly she was how tenderly she tried to give me courage oh the coquetry of happiness while i i took it all for the genuine thing i thought that she but my god how could i have thought it how could i have been so blind when everything had been taken by another already when nothing was mine when in fact her very tenderness to me her anxiety her love yes love for me was nothing else but joy at the thought of seeing another man so soon desire to include me too in her happiness when he did not come when we waited in vain she frowned she grew timid and discouraged her movements her words were no longer so light so playful so gay and strange to say she redoubled her attentiveness to me as though instinctively desiring to lavish on me what she desired for herself so anxiously if her wishes were not accomplished my nastenka was so downcast so dismayed that i think she realized at last that i loved her and was sorry for my poor love so when we are unhappy we feel the unhappiness of others more feeling is not destroyed but concentrated i went to meet her with a full heart and was all impatience i had no presentiment that i should feel as i do now that it would not all end happily she was beaming with pleasure she was expecting an answer the answer was himself he was to come to run at her call she arrived a whole hour before i did at first she giggled at everything laughed at every word i said i began talking but relapsed into silence do you know why i am so glad she said so glad to look at youwhy i like you so much today well i asked and my heart began throbbing i like you because you have not fallen in love with me you know that some men in your place would have been pestering and worrying me would have been sighing and miserable while you are so nice then she wrung my hand so hard that i almost cried out she laughed goodness what a friend you are she began gravely a minute later god sent you to me what would have happened to me if you had not been with me now how disinterested you are how truly you care for me when i am married we will be great friends more than brother and sister i shall care almost as i do for him i felt horribly sad at that moment yet something like laughter was stirring in my soul you are very much upset i said you are frightened you think he wont come oh dear she answered if i were less happy i believe i should cry at your lack of faith at your reproaches however you have made me think and have given me a lot to think about but i shall think later and now i will own that you are right yes i am somehow not myself i am all suspense and feel everything as it were too lightly but hush thats enough about feelings at that moment we heard footsteps and in the darkness we saw a figure coming towards us we both started she almost cried out i dropped her hand and made a movement as though to walk away but we were mistaken it was not he what are you afraid of why did you let go of my hand she said giving it to me again come what is it we will meet him together i want him to see how fond we are of each other how fond we are of each other i cried oh nastenka nastenka i thought how much you have told me in that saying such fondness at certain moments makes the heart cold and the soul heavy your hand is cold mine burns like fire how blind you are nastenka oh how unbearable a happy person is sometimes but i could not be angry with you at last my heart was too full listen nastenka i cried do you know how it has been with me all day why how how tell me quickly why have you said nothing all this time to begin with nastenka when i had carried out all your commissions given the letter gone to see your good friends then then i went home and went to bed is that all she interrupted laughing yes almost all i answered restraining myself for foolish tears were already starting into my eyes i woke an hour before our appointment and yet as it were i had not been asleep i dont know what happened to me i came to tell you all about it feeling as though time were standing still feeling as though one sensation one feeling must remain with me from that time for ever feeling as though one minute must go on for all eternity and as though all life had come to a standstill for me when i woke up it seemed as though some musical motive long familiar heard somewhere in the past forgotten and voluptuously sweet had come back to me now it seemed to me that it had been clamouring at my heart all my life and only now oh my goodness my goodness nastenka interrupted what does all that mean i dont understand a word ah nastenka i wanted somehow to convey to you that strange impression i began in a plaintive voice in which there still lay hid a hope though a very faint one leave off hush she said and in one instant the sly puss had guessed suddenly she became extraordinarily talkative gay mischievous she took my arm laughed wanted me to laugh too and every confused word i uttered evoked from her prolonged ringing laughter i began to feel angry she had suddenly begun flirting do you know she began i feel a little vexed that you are not in love with me theres no understanding human nature but all the same mr unapproachable you cannot blame me for being so simple i tell you everything everything whatever foolish thought comes into my head listen thats eleven i believe i said as the slow chime of a bell rang out from a distant tower she suddenly stopped left off laughing and began to count yes its eleven she said at last in a timid uncertain voice i regretted at once that i had frightened her making her count the strokes and i cursed myself for my spiteful impulse i felt sorry for her and did not know how to atone for what i had done i began comforting her seeking for reasons for his not coming advancing various arguments proofs no one could have been easier to deceive than she was at that moment and indeed any one at such a moment listens gladly to any consolation whatever it may be and is overjoyed if a shadow of excuse can be found and indeed its an absurd thing i began warming to my task and admiring the extraordinary clearness of my argument why he could not have come you have muddled and confused me nastenka so that i too have lost count of the time only think he can scarcely have received the letter suppose he is not able to come suppose he is going to answer the letter could not come before tomorrow i will go for it as soon as its light tomorrow and let you know at once consider there are thousands of possibilities perhaps he was not at home when the letter came and may not have read it even now anything may happen you know yes yes said nastenka i did not think of that of course anything may happen she went on in a tone that offered no opposition though some other faraway thought could be heard like a vexatious discord in it i tell you what you must do she said you go as early as possible tomorrow morning and if you get anything let me know at once you know where i live dont you and she began repeating her address to me then she suddenly became so tender so solicitous with me she seemed to listen attentively to what i told her but when i asked her some question she was silent was confused and turned her head away i looked into her eyesyes she was crying how can you how can you oh what a baby you are what childishness come come she tried to smile to calm herself but her chin was quivering and her bosom was still heaving i was thinking about you she said after a minutes silence you are so kind that i should be a stone if i did not feel it do you know what has occurred to me now i was comparing you two why isnt he you why isnt he like you he is not as good as you though i love him more than you i made no answer she seemed to expect me to say something of course it may be that i dont understand him fully yet you know i was always as it were afraid of him he was always so grave as it were so proud of course i know its only that he seems like that i know there is more tenderness in his heart than in mine i remember how he looked at me when i went in to himdo you rememberwith my bundle but yet i respect him too much and doesnt that show that we are not equals no nastenka no i answered it shows that you love him more than anything in the world and far more than yourself yes supposing that is so answered nastenka navely but do you know what strikes me now only i am not talking about him now but speaking generally all this came into my mind some time ago tell me how is it that we cant all be like brothers together why is it that even the best of men always seem to hide something from other people and to keep something back why not say straight out what is in ones heart when one knows that one is not speaking idly as it is every one seems harsher than he really is as though all were afraid of doing injustice to their feelings by being too quick to express them oh nastenka what you say is true but there are many reasons for that i broke in suppressing my own feelings at that moment more than ever no no she answered with deep feeling here you for instance are not like other people i really dont know how to tell you what i feel but it seems to me that you for instance at the present moment it seems to me that you are sacrificing something for me she added timidly with a fleeting glance at me forgive me for saying so i am a simple girl you know i have seen very little of life and i really sometimes dont know how to say things she added in a voice that quivered with some hidden feeling while she tried to smile but i only wanted to tell you that i am grateful that i feel it all too oh may god give you happiness for it what you told me about your dreamer is quite untrue nowthat is i mean its not true of you you are recovering you are quite a different man from what you described if you ever fall in love with some one god give you happiness with her i wont wish anything for her for she will be happy with you i know i am a woman myself so you must believe me when i tell you so she ceased speaking and pressed my hand warmly i too could not speak without emotion some minutes passed yes its clear he wont come tonight she said at last raising her head its late he will come tomorrow i said in the most firm and convincing tone yes she added with no sign of her former depression i see for myself now that he could not come till tomorrow well goodbye till tomorrow if it rains perhaps i shall not come but the day after tomorrow i shall come i shall come for certain whatever happens be sure to be here i want to see you i will tell you everything and then when we parted she gave me her hand and said looking at me candidly we shall always be together shant we oh nastenka nastenka if only you knew how lonely i am now as soon as it struck nine oclock i could not stay indoors but put on my things and went out in spite of the weather i was there sitting on our seat i went to her street but i felt ashamed and turned back without looking at their windows when i was two steps from her door i went home more depressed than i had ever been before what a damp dreary day if it had been fine i should have walked about all night but tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow she will tell me everything the letter has not come today however but that was to be expected they are together by now fourth night my god how it has all ended what it has all ended in i arrived at nine oclock she was already there i noticed her a good way off she was standing as she had been that first time with her elbows on the railing and she did not hear me coming up to her nastenka i called to her suppressing my agitation with an effort she turned to me quickly well she said well make haste i looked at her in perplexity well where is the letter have you brought the letter she repeated clutching at the railing no there is no letter i said at last hasnt he been to you yet she turned fearfully pale and looked at me for a long time without moving i had shattered her last hope well god be with him she said at last in a breaking voice god be with him if he leaves me like that she dropped her eyes then tried to look at me and could not for several minutes she was struggling with her emotion all at once she turned away leaning her elbows against the railing and burst into tears oh dont dont i began but looking at her i had not the heart to go on and what was i to say to her dont try and comfort me she said dont talk about him dont tell me that he will come that he has not cast me off so cruelly and so inhumanly as he has what forwhat for can there have been something in my letter that unlucky letter at that point sobs stifled her voice my heart was torn as i looked at her oh how inhumanly cruel it is she began again and not a line not a line he might at least have written that he does not want me that he rejects mebut not a line for three days how easy it is for him to wound to insult a poor defenceless girl whose only fault is that she loves him oh what ive suffered during these three days oh dear when i think that i was the first to go to him that i humbled myself before him cried that i begged of him a little love and after that listen she said turning to me and her black eyes flashed it isnt so it cant be so it isnt natural either you are mistaken or i perhaps he has not received the letter perhaps he still knows nothing about it how could any onejudge for yourself tell me for goodness sake explain it to me i cant understand ithow could any one behave with such barbarous coarseness as he has behaved to me not one word why the lowest creature on earth is treated more compassionately perhaps he has heard something perhaps some one has told him something about me she cried turning to me inquiringly what do you think listen nastenka i shall go to him tomorrow in your name yes i will question him about everything i will tell him everything yes yes you write a letter dont say no nastenka dont say no i will make him respect your action he shall hear all about it and if no my friend no she interrupted enough not another word not another line from meenough i dont know him i dont love him any more i will forget him she could not go on calm yourself calm yourself sit here nastenka i said making her sit down on the seat i am calm dont trouble its nothing its only tears they will soon dry why do you imagine i shall do away with myself that i shall throw myself into the river my heart was full i tried to speak but i could not listen she said taking my hand tell me you wouldnt have behaved like this would you you would not have abandoned a girl who had come to you of herself you would not have thrown into her face a shameless taunt at her weak foolish heart you would have taken care of her you would have realized that she was alone that she did not know how to look after herself that she could not guard herself from loving you that it was not her fault not her faultthat she had done nothing oh dear oh dear nastenka i cried at last unable to control my emotion nastenka you torture me you wound my heart you are killing me nastenka i cannot be silent i must speak at last give utterance to what is surging in my heart as i said this i got up from the seat she took my hand and looked at me in surprise what is the matter with you she said at last listen i said resolutely listen to me nastenka what i am going to say to you now is all nonsense all impossible all stupid i know that this can never be but i cannot be silent for the sake of what you are suffering now i beg you beforehand to forgive me what is it what is it she said drying her tears and looking at me intently while a strange curiosity gleamed in her astonished eyes what is the matter its impossible but i love you nastenka there it is now everything is told i said with a wave of my hand now you will see whether you can go on talking to me as you did just now whether you can listen to what i am going to say to you well what then nastenka interrupted me what of it i knew you loved me long ago only i always thought that you simply liked me very much oh dear oh dear at first it was simply liking nastenka but now now i am just in the same position as you were when you went to him with your bundle in a worse position than you nastenka because he cared for no one else as you do what are you saying to me i dont understand you in the least but tell me whats this for i dont mean what for but why are you so suddenly oh dear i am talking nonsense but you and nastenka broke off in confusion her cheeks flamed she dropped her eyes whats to be done nastenka what am i to do i am to blame i have abused your but no no i am not to blame nastenka i feel that i know that because my heart tells me i am right for i cannot hurt you in any way i cannot wound you i was your friend but i am still your friend i have betrayed no trust here my tears are falling nastenka let them flow let them flowthey dont hurt anybody they will dry nastenka sit down sit down she said making me sit down on the seat oh my god no nastenka i wont sit down i cannot stay here any longer you cannot see me again i will tell you everything and go away i only want to say that you would never have found out that i loved you i should have kept my secret i would not have worried you at such a moment with my egoism no but i could not resist it now you spoke of it yourself it is your fault your fault and not mine you cannot drive me away from you no no i dont drive you away no said nastenka concealing her confusion as best she could poor child you dont drive me away no but i meant to run from you myself i will go away but first i will tell you all for when you were crying here i could not sit unmoved when you wept when you were in torture at beingat beingi will speak of it nastenkaat being forsaken at your love being repulsed i felt that in my heart there was so much love for you nastenka so much love and it seemed so bitter that i could not help you with my love that my heart was breaking and i i could not be silent i had to speak nastenka i had to speak yes yes tell me talk to me said nastenka with an indescribable gesture perhaps you think it strange that i talk to you like this but speak i will tell you afterwards i will tell you everything you are sorry for me nastenka you are simply sorry for me my dear little friend whats done cant be mended what is said cannot be taken back isnt that so well now you know thats the startingpoint very well now its all right only listen when you were sitting crying i thought to myself oh let me tell you what i was thinking i thought that of course it cannot be nastenka i thought that you i thought that you somehow quite apart from me had ceased to love him theni thought that yesterday and the day before yesterday nastenkathen i wouldi certainly wouldhave succeeded in making you love me you know you said yourself nastenka that you almost loved me well what next well thats nearly all i wanted to tell you all that is left to say is how it would be if you loved me only that nothing more listen my friendfor any way you are my friendi am of course a poor humble man of no great consequence but thats not the point i dont seem to be able to say what i mean nastenka i am so confused only i would love you i would love you so that even if you still loved him even if you went on loving the man i dont know you would never feel that my love was a burden to you you would only feel every minute that at your side was beating a grateful grateful heart a warm heart ready for your sake oh nastenka nastenka what have you done to me dont cry i dont want you to cry said nastenka getting up quickly from the seat come along get up come with me dont cry dont cry she said drying her tears with her handkerchief let us go now maybe i will tell you something if he has forsaken me now if he has forgotten me though i still love him i do not want to deceive you but listen answer me if i were to love you for instance that is if i only oh my friend my friend to think to think how i wounded you when i laughed at your love when i praised you for not falling in love with me oh dear how was it i did not foresee this how was it i did not foresee this how could i have been so stupid but well i have made up my mind i will tell you look here nastenka do you know what ill go away thats what ill do i am simply tormenting you here you are remorseful for having laughed at me and i wont have you in addition to your sorrow of course it is my fault nastenka but goodbye stay listen to me can you wait what for how i love him but i shall get over it i must get over it i cannot fail to get over it i am getting over it i feel that who knows perhaps it will all end today for i hate him for he has been laughing at me while you have been weeping here with me for you have not repulsed me as he has for you love me while he has never loved me for in fact i love you myself yes i love you i love you as you love me i have told you so before you heard it yourselfi love you because you are better than he is because you are nobler than he is because because he the poor girls emotion was so violent that she could not say more she laid her head upon my shoulder then upon my bosom and wept bitterly i comforted her i persuaded her but she could not stop crying she kept pressing my hand and saying between her sobs wait wait it will be over in a minute i want to tell you you mustnt think that these tearsits nothing its weakness wait till its over at last she left off crying dried her eyes and we walked on again i wanted to speak but she still begged me to wait we were silent at last she plucked up courage and began to speak its like this she began in a weak and quivering voice in which however there was a note that pierced my heart with a sweet pang dont think that i am so light and inconstant dont think that i can forget and change so quickly i have loved him for a whole year and i swear by god that i have never never even in thought been unfaithful to him he has despised me he has been laughing at megod forgive him but he has insulted me and wounded my heart i i do not love him for i can only love what is magnanimous what understands me what is generous for i am like that myself and he is not worthy of mewell thats enough of him he has done better than if he had deceived my expectations later and shown me later what he was well its over but who knows my dear friend she went on pressing my hand who knows perhaps my whole love was a mistaken feeling a delusionperhaps it began in mischief in nonsense because i was kept so strictly by grandmother perhaps i ought to love another man not him a different man who would have pity on me and and but dont let us say any more about that nastenka broke off breathless with emotion i only wanted to tell you i wanted to tell you that if although i love him no did love him if in spite of this you still say if you feel that your love is so great that it may at last drive from my heart my old feelingif you will have pity on meif you do not want to leave me alone to my fate without hope without consolationif you are ready to love me always as you do nowi swear to you that gratitude that my love will be at last worthy of your love will you take my hand nastenka i cried breathless with sobs nastenka oh nastenka enough enough well now its quite enough she said hardly able to control herself well now all has been said hasnt it hasnt it you are happyi am happy too not another word about it wait spare me talk of something else for gods sake yes nastenka yes enough about that now i am happy i yes nastenka yes let us talk of other things let us make haste and talk yes i am ready and we did not know what to say we laughed we wept we said thousands of things meaningless and incoherent at one moment we walked along the pavement then suddenly turned back and crossed the road then we stopped and went back again to the embankment we were like children i am living alone now nastenka i began but tomorrow of course you know nastenka i am poor i have only got twelve hundred roubles but that doesnt matter of course not and granny has her pension so she will be no burden we must take granny of course we must take granny but theres matrona yes and weve got fyokla too matrona is a good woman but she has one fault she has no imagination nastenka absolutely none but that doesnt matter thats all rightthey can live together only you must move to us tomorrow to you how so all right i am ready yes hire a room from us we have a top floor its empty we had an old lady lodging there but she has gone away and i know granny would like to have a young man i said to her why a young man and she said oh because i am old only dont you fancy nastenka that i want him as a husband for you so i guessed it was with that idea oh nastenka and we both laughed come thats enough thats enough but where do you live ive forgotten over that way near x bridge barannikovs buildings its that big house yes that big house oh i know a nice house only you know you had better give it up and come to us as soon as possible tomorrow nastenka tomorrow i owe a little for my rent there but that doesnt matter i shall soon get my salary and do you know i will perhaps give lessons i will learn something myself and then give lessons capital and i shall soon get a bonus so by tomorrow you will be my lodger and we will go to the barber of seville for they are soon going to give it again yes well go said nastenka but better see something else and not the barber of seville very well something else of course that will be better i did not think as we talked like this we walked along in a sort of delirium a sort of intoxication as though we did not know what was happening to us at one moment we stopped and talked for a long time at the same place then we went on again and goodness knows where we went and again tears and again laughter all of a sudden nastenka would want to go home and i would not dare to detain her but would want to see her to the house we set off and in a quarter of an hour found ourselves at the embankment by our seat then she would sigh and tears would come into her eyes again i would turn chill with dismay but she would press my hand and force me to walk to talk to chatter as before its time i was home at last i think it must be very late nastenka said at last we must give over being childish yes nastenka only i shant sleep tonight i am not going home i dont think i shall sleep either only see me home i should think so only this time we really must get to the house we must we must honour bright for you know one must go home some time honour bright i answered laughing well come along come along look at the sky nastenka look tomorrow it will be a lovely day what a blue sky what a moon look that yellow cloud is covering it now look look no it has passed by look look but nastenka did not look at the cloud she stood mute as though turned to stone a minute later she huddled timidly close up to me her hand trembled in my hand i looked at her she pressed still more closely to me at that moment a young man passed by us he suddenly stopped looked at us intently and then again took a few steps on my heart began throbbing who is it nastenka i said in an undertone its he she answered in a whisper huddling up to me still more closely still more tremulously i could hardly stand on my feet nastenka nastenka its you i heard a voice behind us and at the same moment the young man took several steps towards us my god how she cried out how she started how she tore herself out of my arms and rushed to meet him i stood and looked at them utterly crushed but she had hardly given him her hand had hardly flung herself into his arms when she turned to me again was beside me again in a flash and before i knew where i was she threw both arms round my neck and gave me a warm tender kiss then without saying a word to me she rushed back to him again took his hand and drew him after her i stood a long time looking after them at last the two vanished from my sight morning my night ended with the morning it was a wet day the rain was falling and beating disconsolately upon my window pane it was dark in the room and grey outside my head ached and i was giddy fever was stealing over my limbs theres a letter for you sir the postman brought it matrona said stooping over me a letter from whom i cried jumping up from my chair i dont know sir better lookmaybe it is written there whom it is from i broke the seal it was from her oh forgive me forgive me i beg you on my knees to forgive me i deceived you and myself it was a dream a mirage my heart aches for you today forgive me forgive me dont blame me for i have not changed to you in the least i told you that i would love you i love you now i more than love you oh my god if only i could love you both at once oh if only you were he oh if only he were you echoed in my mind i remembered your words nastenka god knows what i would do for you now i know that you are sad and dreary i have wounded you but you know when one loves a wrong is soon forgotten and you love me thank you yes thank you for that love for it will live in my memory like a sweet dream which lingers long after awakening for i shall remember for ever that instant when you opened your heart to me like a brother and so generously accepted the gift of my shattered heart to care for it nurse it and heal it if you forgive me the memory of you will be exalted by a feeling of everlasting gratitude which will never be effaced from my soul i will treasure that memory i will be true to it i will not betray it i will not betray my heart it is too constant it returned so quickly yesterday to him to whom it has always belonged we shall meet you will come to us you will not leave us you will be for ever a friend a brother to me and when you see me you will give me your hand yes you will give it to me you have forgiven me havent you you love me as before oh love me do not forsake me because i love you so at this moment because i am worthy of your love because i will deserve it my dear next week i am to be married to him he has come back in love he has never forgotten me you will not be angry at my writing about him but i want to come and see you with him you will like him wont you forgive me remember and love your nastenka i read that letter over and over again for a long time tears gushed to my eyes at last it fell from my hands and i hid my face dearie i say dearie matrona began what is it matrona i have taken all the cobwebs off the ceiling you can have a wedding or give a party i looked at matrona she was still a hearty youngish old woman but i dont know why all at once i suddenly pictured her with lustreless eyes a wrinkled face bent decrepit i dont know why i suddenly pictured my room grown old like matrona the walls and the floors looked discoloured everything seemed dingy the spiders webs were thicker than ever i dont know why but when i looked out of the window it seemed to me that the house opposite had grown old and dingy too that the stucco on the columns was peeling off and crumbling that the cornices were cracked and blackened and that the walls of a vivid deep yellow were patchy either the sunbeams suddenly peeping out from the clouds for a moment were hidden again behind a veil of rain and everything had grown dingy again before my eyes or perhaps the whole vista of my future flashed before me so sad and forbidding and i saw myself just as i was now fifteen years hence older in the same room just as solitary with the same matrona grown no cleverer for those fifteen years but to imagine that i should bear you a grudge nastenka that i should cast a dark cloud over your serene untroubled happiness that by my bitter reproaches i should cause distress to your heart should poison it with secret remorse and should force it to throb with anguish at the moment of bliss that i should crush a single one of those tender blossoms which you have twined in your dark tresses when you go with him to the altar oh never never may your sky be clear may your sweet smile be bright and untroubled and may you be blessed for that moment of blissful happiness which you gave to another lonely and grateful heart my god a whole moment of happiness is that too little for the whole of a mans life notes from underground a novel part i underground i i am a sick man i am a spiteful man i am an unattractive man i believe my liver is diseased however i know nothing at all about my disease and do not know for certain what ails me i dont consult a doctor for it and never have though i have a respect for medicine and doctors besides i am extremely superstitious sufficiently so to respect medicine anyway i am welleducated enough not to be superstitious but i am superstitious no i refuse to consult a doctor from spite that you probably will not understand well i understand it though of course i cant explain who it is precisely that i am mortifying in this case by my spite i am perfectly well aware that i cannot pay out the doctors by not consulting them i know better than any one that by all this i am only injuring myself and no one else but still if i dont consult a doctor it is from spite my liver is bad welllet it get worse footnote the author of the diary and the diary itself are of course imaginary nevertheless it is clear that such persons as the writer of these notes not only may but positively must exist in our society when we consider the circumstances in the midst of which our society is formed i have tried to expose to the view of the public more distinctly than is commonly done one of the characters of the recent past he is one of the representatives of a generation still living in this fragment entitled underground this person introduces himself and his views and as it were tries to explain the causes owing to which he has made his appearance and was bound to make his appearance in our midst in the second fragment there are added the actual notes of this person concerning certain events in his lifeauthors note i have been going on like that for a long timetwenty years now i am forty i used to be in the government service but am no longer i was a spiteful official i was rude and took pleasure in being so i did not take bribes you see so i was bound to find a recompense in that at least a poor jest but i will not scratch it out i wrote it thinking it would sound very witty but now that i have seen myself that i only wanted to show off in a despicable way i will not scratch it out on purpose when petitioners used to come for information to the table at which i sat i used to grind my teeth at them and felt intense enjoyment when i succeeded in making anybody unhappy i almost always did succeed for the most part they were all timid peopleof course they were petitioners but of the uppish ones there was one officer in particular i could not endure he simply would not be humble and clanked his sword in a disgusting way i carried on a feud with him for eighteen months over that sword at last i got the better of him he left off clanking it that happened in my youth though but do you know gentlemen what was the chief point about my spite why the whole point the real sting of it lay in the fact that continually even in the moment of the acutest spleen i was inwardly conscious with shame that i was not only not a spiteful but not even an embittered man that i was simply scaring sparrows at random and amusing myself by it i might foam at the mouth but bring me a doll to play with give me a cup of tea with sugar in it and maybe i should be appeased i might even be genuinely touched though probably i should grind my teeth at myself afterwards and lie awake at night with shame for months after that was my way i was lying when i said just now that i was a spiteful official i was lying from spite i was simply amusing myself with the petitioners and with the officer and in reality i never could become spiteful i was conscious every moment in myself of many very many elements absolutely opposite to that i felt them positively swarming in me these opposite elements i knew that they had been swarming in me all my life and craving some outlet from me but i would not let them would not let them purposely would not let them come out they tormented me till i was ashamed they drove me to convulsions andsickened me at last how they sickened me now are not you fancying gentlemen that i am expressing remorse for something now that i am asking your forgiveness for something i am sure you are fancying that however i assure you i do not care if you are it was not only that i could not become spiteful i did not know how to become anything neither spiteful nor kind neither a rascal nor an honest man neither a hero nor an insect now i am living out my life in my corner taunting myself with the spiteful and useless consolation that an intelligent man cannot become anything seriously and it is only the fool who becomes anything yes a man in the nineteenth century must and morally ought to be preeminently a characterless creature a man of character an active man is preeminently a limited creature that is my conviction of forty years i am forty years old now and you know forty years is a whole lifetime you know it is extreme old age to live longer than forty years is bad manners is vulgar immoral who does live beyond forty answer that sincerely and honestly i will tell you who do fools and worthless fellows i tell all old men that to their face all these venerable old men all these silverhaired and reverend seniors i tell the whole world that to its face i have a right to say so for i shall go on living to sixty myself to seventy to eighty stay let me take breath you imagine no doubt gentlemen that i want to amuse you you are mistaken in that too i am by no means such a mirthful person as you imagine or as you may imagine however irritated by all this babble and i feel that you are irritated you think fit to ask me who am ithen my answer is i am a collegiate assessor i was in the service that i might have something to eat and solely for that reason and when last year a distant relation left me six thousand roubles in his will i immediately retired from the service and settled down in my corner i used to live in this corner before but now i have settled down in it my room is a wretched horrid one in the outskirts of the town my servant is an old countrywoman illnatured from stupidity and moreover there is always a nasty smell about her i am told that the petersburg climate is bad for me and that with my small means it is very expensive to live in petersburg i know all that better than all these sage and experienced counsellors and monitors but i am remaining in petersburg i am not going away from petersburg i am not going away because ech why it is absolutely no matter whether i am going away or not going away but what can a decent man speak of with most pleasure answer of himself well so i will talk about myself ii i want now to tell you gentlemen whether you care to hear it or not why i could not even become an insect i tell you solemnly that i have many times tried to become an insect but i was not equal even to that i swear gentlemen that to be too conscious is an illnessa real thoroughgoing illness for mans everyday needs it would have been quite enough to have the ordinary human consciousness that is half or a quarter of the amount which falls to the lot of a cultivated man of our unhappy nineteenth century especially one who has the fatal illluck to inhabit petersburg the most theoretical and intentional town on the whole terrestrial globe there are intentional and unintentional towns it would have been quite enough for instance to have the consciousness by which all socalled direct persons and men of action live i bet you think i am writing all this from affectation to be witty at the expense of men of action and what is more that from illbred affectation i am clanking a sword like my officer but gentlemen whoever can pride himself on his diseases and even swagger over them though after all every one does do that people do pride themselves on their diseases and i do may be more than any one we will not dispute it my contention was absurd but yet i am firmly persuaded that a great deal of consciousness every sort of consciousness in fact is a disease i stick to that let us leave that too for a minute tell me this why does it happen that at the very yes at the very moments when i am most capable of feeling every refinement of all that is good and beautiful as they used to say at one time it would as though of design happen to me not only to feel but to do such ugly things such that well in short actions that all perhaps commit but which as though purposely occurred to me at the very time when i was most conscious that they ought not to be committed the more conscious i was of goodness and of all that was good and beautiful the more deeply i sank into my mire and the more ready i was to sink in it altogether but the chief point was that all this was as it were not accidental in me but as though it were bound to be so it was as though it were my most normal condition and not in the least disease or depravity so that at last all desire in me to struggle against this depravity passed it ended by my almost believing perhaps actually believing that this was perhaps my normal condition but at first in the beginning what agonies i endured in that struggle i did not believe it was the same with other people and all my life i hid this fact about myself as a secret i was ashamed even now perhaps i am ashamed i got to the point of feeling a sort of secret abnormal despicable enjoyment in returning home to my corner on some disgusting petersburg night acutely conscious that that day i had committed a loathsome action again that what was done could never be undone and secretly inwardly gnawing gnawing at myself for it tearing and consuming myself till at last the bitterness turned into a sort of shameful accursed sweetness and at lastinto positive real enjoyment yes into enjoyment into enjoyment i insist upon that i have spoken of this because i keep wanting to know for a fact whether other people feel such enjoyment i will explain the enjoyment was just from the too intense consciousness of ones own degradation it was from feeling oneself that one had reached the last barrier that it was horrible but that it could not be otherwise that there was no escape for you that you never could become a different man that even if time and faith were still left you to change into something different you would most likely not wish to change or if you did wish to even then you would do nothing because perhaps in reality there was nothing for you to change into and the worst of it was and the root of it all that it was all in accord with the normal fundamental laws of overacute consciousness and with the inertia that was the direct result of those laws and that consequently one was not only unable to change but could do absolutely nothing thus it would follow as the result of acute consciousness that one is not to blame in being a scoundrel as though that were any consolation to the scoundrel once he has come to realize that he actually is a scoundrel but enough ech i have talked a lot of nonsense but what have i explained how is enjoyment in this to be explained but i will explain it i will get to the bottom of it that is why i have taken up my pen i for instance have a great deal of amour propre i am as suspicious and prone to take offence as a humpback or a dwarf but upon my word i sometimes have had moments when if i had happened to be slapped in the face i should perhaps have been positively glad of it i say in earnest that i should probably have been able to discover even in that a peculiar sort of enjoymentthe enjoyment of course of despair but in despair there are the most intense enjoyments especially when one is very acutely conscious of the hopelessness of ones position and when one is slapped in the facewhy then the consciousness of being rubbed into a pulp would positively overwhelm one the worst of it is look at it which way one will it still turns out that i was always the most to blame in everything and what is most humiliating of all to blame for no fault of my own but so to say through the laws of nature in the first place to blame because i am cleverer than any of the people surrounding me i have always considered myself cleverer than any of the people surrounding me and sometimes would you believe it have been positively ashamed of it at any rate i have all my life as it were turned my eyes away and never could look people straight in the face to blame finally because even if i had had magnanimity i should only have had more suffering from the sense of its uselessness i should certainly have never been able to do anything from being magnanimousneither to forgive for my assailant would perhaps have slapped me from the laws of nature and one cannot forgive the laws of nature nor to forget for even if it were owing to the laws of nature it is insulting all the same finally even if i had wanted to be anything but magnanimous had desired on the contrary to revenge myself on my assailant i could not have revenged myself on any one for anything because i should certainly never have made up my mind to do anything even if i had been able to why should i not have made up my mind about that in particular i want to say a few words iii with people who know how to revenge themselves and to stand up for themselves in general how is it done why when they are possessed let us suppose by the feeling of revenge then for the time there is nothing else but that feeling left in their whole being such a gentleman simply dashes straight for his object like an infuriated bull with its horns down and nothing but a wall will stop him by the way facing the wall such gentlementhat is the direct persons and men of actionare genuinely nonplussed for them a wall is not an evasion as for us people who think and consequently do nothing it is not an excuse for turning aside an excuse for which we are always very glad though we scarcely believe in it ourselves as a rule no they are nonplussed in all sincerity the wall has for them something tranquillizing morally soothing finalmaybe even something mysterious but of the wall later well such a direct person i regard as the real normal man as his tender mother nature wished to see him when she graciously brought him into being on the earth i envy such a man till i am green in the face he is stupid i am not disputing that but perhaps the normal man should be stupid how do you know perhaps it is very beautiful in fact and i am the more persuaded of that suspicion if one can call it so by the fact that if you take for instance the antithesis of the normal man that is the man of acute consciousness who has come of course not out of the lap of nature but out of a retort this is almost mysticism gentlemen but i suspect this too this retortmade man is sometimes so nonplussed in the presence of his antithesis that with all his exaggerated consciousness he genuinely thinks of himself as a mouse and not a man it may be an acutely conscious mouse yet it is a mouse while the other is a man and therefore et ctera et ctera and the worst of it is he himself his very own self looks on himself as a mouse no one asks him to do so and that is an important point now let us look at this mouse in action let us suppose for instance that it feels insulted too and it almost always does feel insulted and wants to revenge itself too there may even be a greater accumulation of spite in it than in lhomme de la nature et de la vrit the base and nasty desire to vent that spite on its assailant rankles perhaps even more nastily in it than in lhomme de la nature et de la vrit for through his innate stupidity the latter looks upon his revenge as justice pure and simple while in consequence of his acute consciousness the mouse does not believe in the justice of it to come at last to the deed itself to the very act of revenge apart from the one fundamental nastiness the luckless mouse succeeds in creating around it so many other nastinesses in the form of doubts and questions adds to the one question so many unsettled questions that there inevitably works up around it a sort of fatal brew a stinking mess made up of its doubts emotions and of the contempt spat upon it by the direct men of action who stand solemnly about it as judges and arbitrators laughing at it till their healthy sides ache of course the only thing left for it is to dismiss all that with a wave of its paw and with a smile of assumed contempt in which it does not even itself believe creep ignominiously into its mousehole there in its nasty stinking underground home our insulted crushed and ridiculed mouse promptly becomes absorbed in cold malignant and above all everlasting spite for forty years together it will remember its injury down to the smallest most ignominious details and every time will add of itself details still more ignominious spitefully teasing and tormenting itself with its own imagination it will itself be ashamed of its imaginings but yet it will recall it all it will go over and over every detail it will invent unheard of things against itself pretending that those things might happen and will forgive nothing maybe it will begin to revenge itself too but as it were piecemeal in trivial ways from behind the stove incognito without believing either in its own right to vengeance or in the success of its revenge knowing that from all its efforts at revenge it will suffer a hundred times more than he on whom it revenges itself while he i daresay will not even scratch himself on its deathbed it will recall it all over again with interest accumulated over all the years and but it is just in that cold abominable half despair half belief in that conscious burying oneself alive for grief in the underworld for forty years in that acutely recognized and yet partly doubtful hopelessness of ones position in that hell of unsatisfied desires turned inward in that fever of oscillations of resolutions determined for ever and repented of again a minute laterthat the savour of that strange enjoyment of which i have spoken lies it is so subtle so difficult of analysis that persons who are a little limited or even simply persons of strong nerves will not understand a single atom of it possibly you will add on your own account with a grin people will not understand it either who have never received a slap in the face and in that way you will politely hint to me that i too perhaps have had the experience of a slap in the face in my life and so i speak as one who knows i bet that you are thinking that but set your minds at rest gentlemen i have not received a slap in the face though it is absolutely a matter of indifference to me what you may think about it possibly i even regret myself that i have given so few slaps in the face during my life but enough not another word on that subject of such extreme interest to you i will continue calmly concerning persons with strong nerves who do not understand a certain refinement of enjoyment though in certain circumstances these gentlemen bellow their loudest like bulls though this let us suppose does them the greatest credit yet as i have said already confronted with the impossible they subside at once the impossible means the stone wall what stone wall why of course the laws of nature the deductions of natural science mathematics as soon as they prove to you for instance that you are descended from a monkey then it is no use scowling accept it for a fact when they prove to you that in reality one drop of your own fat must be dearer to you than a hundred thousand of your fellow creatures and that this conclusion is the final solution of all socalled virtues and duties and all such prejudices and fancies then you have just to accept it there is no help for it for twice two is a law of mathematics just try refuting it upon my word they will shout at you it is no use protesting it is a case of twice two makes four nature does not ask your permission she has nothing to do with your wishes and whether you like her laws or dislike them you are bound to accept her as she is and consequently all her conclusions a wall you see is a wall and so on and so on merciful heavens but what do i care for the laws of nature and arithmetic when for some reason i dislike those laws and the fact that twice two makes four of course i cannot break through the wall by battering my head against it if i really have not the strength to knock it down but i am not going to be reconciled to it simply because it is a stone wall and i have not the strength as though such a stone wall really were a consolation and really did contain some word of conciliation simply because it is as true as twice two makes four oh absurdity of absurdities how much better it is to understand it all to recognize it all all the impossibilities and the stone wall not to be reconciled to one of those impossibilities and stone walls if it disgusts you to be reconciled to it by the way of the most inevitable logical combinations to reach the most revolting conclusions on the everlasting theme that even for the stone wall you are yourself somehow to blame though again it is as clear as day you are not to blame in the least and therefore grinding your teeth in silent impotence to sink into luxurious inertia brooding on the fact that there is no one even for you to feel vindictive against that you have not and perhaps never will have an object for your spite that it is a sleight of hand a bit of juggling a cardsharpers trick that it is simply a mess no knowing what and no knowing who but in spite of all these uncertainties and jugglings still there is an ache in you and the more you do not know the worse the ache iv ha ha ha you will be finding enjoyment in toothache next you cry with a laugh well even in toothache there is enjoyment i answer i had toothache for a whole month and i know there is in that case of course people are not spiteful in silence but moan but they are not candid moans they are malignant moans and the malignancy is the whole point the enjoyment of the sufferer finds expression in those moans if he did not feel enjoyment in them he would not moan it is a good example gentlemen and i will develop it those moans express in the first place all the aimlessness of your pain which is so humiliating to your consciousness the whole legal system of nature on which you spit disdainfully of course but from which you suffer all the same while she does not they express the consciousness that you have no enemy to punish but that you have pain the consciousness that in spite of all possible vagenheims you are in complete slavery to your teeth that if some one wishes it your teeth will leave off aching and if he does not they will go on aching another three months and that finally if you are still contumacious and still protest all that is left you for your own gratification is to thrash yourself or beat your wall with your fist as hard as you can and absolutely nothing more well these mortal insults these jeers on the part of some one unknown end at last in an enjoyment which sometimes reaches the highest degree of voluptuousness i ask you gentlemen listen sometimes to the moans of an educated man of the nineteenth century suffering from toothache on the second or third day of the attack when he is beginning to moan not as he moaned on the first day that is not simply because he has toothache not just as any coarse peasant but as a man affected by progress and european civilization a man who is divorced from the soil and the national elements as they express it nowadays his moans become nasty disgustingly malignant and go on for whole days and nights and of course he knows himself that he is doing himself no sort of good with his moans he knows better than any one that he is only lacerating and harassing himself and others for nothing he knows that even the audience before whom he is making his efforts and his whole family listen to him with loathing do not put a haporth of faith in him and inwardly understand that he might moan differently more simply without trills and flourishes and that he is only amusing himself like that from illhumour from malignancy well in all these recognitions and disgraces it is that there lies a voluptuous pleasure as though he would say i am worrying you i am lacerating your hearts i am keeping every one in the house awake well stay awake then you too feel every minute that i have toothache i am not a hero to you now as i tried to seem before but simply a nasty person an impostor well so be it then i am very glad that you see through me it is nasty for you to hear my despicable moans well let it be nasty here i will let you have a nastier flourish in a minute you do not understand even now gentlemen no it seems our development and our consciousness must go further to understand all the intricacies of this pleasure you laugh delighted my jests gentlemen are of course in bad taste jerky involved lacking selfconfidence but of course that is because i do not respect myself can a man of perception respect himself at all v come can a man who attempts to find enjoyment in the very feeling of his own degradation possibly have a spark of respect for himself i am not saying this now from any mawkish kind of remorse and indeed i could never endure saying forgive me papa i wont do it again not because i am incapable of saying thaton the contrary perhaps just because i have been too capable of it and in what a way too as though of design i used to get into trouble in cases when i was not to blame in any way that was the nastiest part of it at the same time i was genuinely touched and penitent i used to shed tears and of course deceived myself though i was not acting in the least and there was a sick feeling in my heart at the time for that one could not blame even the laws of nature though the laws of nature have continually all my life offended me more than anything it is loathsome to remember it all but it was loathsome even then of course a minute or so later i would realize wrathfully that it was all a lie a revolting lie an affected lie that is all this penitence this emotion these vows of reform you will ask why did i worry myself with such antics answer because it was very dull to sit with ones hands folded and so one began cutting capers that is really it observe yourselves more carefully gentlemen then you will understand that it is so i invented adventures for myself and made up a life so as at least to live in some way how many times it has happened to mewell for instance to take offence simply on purpose for nothing and one knows oneself of course that one is offended at nothing that one is putting it on but yet one brings oneself at last to the point of being really offended all my life i have had an impulse to play such pranks so that in the end i could not control it in myself another time twice in fact i tried hard to be in love i suffered too gentlemen i assure you in the depth of my heart there was no faith in my suffering only a faint stir of mockery but yet i did suffer and in the real orthodox way i was jealous beside myself and it was all from ennui gentlemen all from ennui inertia overcame me you know the direct legitimate fruit of consciousness is inertia that is conscious sittingwiththehandsfolded i have referred to this already i repeat i repeat with emphasis all direct persons and men of action are active just because they are stupid and limited how explain that i will tell you in consequence of their limitation they take immediate and secondary causes for primary ones and in that way persuade themselves more quickly and easily than other people do that they have found an infallible foundation for their activity and their minds are at ease and you know that is the chief thing to begin to act you know you must first have your mind completely at ease and no trace of doubt left in it why how am i for example to set my mind at rest where are the primary causes on which i am to build where are my foundations where am i to get them from i exercise myself in reflection and consequently with me every primary cause at once draws after itself another still more primary and so on to infinity that is just the essence of every sort of consciousness and reflection it must be a case of the laws of nature again what is the result of it in the end why just the same remember i spoke just now of vengeance i am sure you did not take it in i said that a man revenges himself because he sees justice in it therefore he has found a primary cause that is justice and so he is at rest on all sides and consequently he carries out his revenge calmly and successfully being persuaded that he is doing a just and honest thing but i see no justice in it i find no sort of virtue in it either and consequently if i attempt to revenge myself it is only out of spite spite of course might overcome everything all my doubts and so might serve quite successfully in place of a primary cause precisely because it is not a cause but what is to be done if i have not even spite i began with that just now you know in consequence again of those accursed laws of consciousness anger in me is subject to chemical disintegration you look into it the object flies off into air your reasons evaporate the criminal is not to be found the wrong becomes not a wrong but a phantom something like the toothache for which no one is to blame and consequently there is only the same outlet left againthat is to beat the wall as hard as you can so you give it up with a wave of the hand because you have not found a fundamental cause and try letting yourself be carried away by your feelings blindly without reflection without a primary cause repelling consciousness at least for a time hate or love if only not to sit with your hands folded the day after tomorrow at the latest you will begin despising yourself for having knowingly deceived yourself result a soapbubble and inertia oh gentlemen do you know perhaps i consider myself an intelligent man only because all my life i have been able neither to begin nor to finish anything granted i am a babbler a harmless vexatious babbler like all of us but what is to be done if the direct and sole vocation of every intelligent man is babble that is the intentional pouring of water through a sieve vi oh if i had done nothing simply from laziness heavens how i should have respected myself then i should have respected myself because i should at least have been capable of being lazy there would at least have been one quality as it were positive in me in which i could have believed myself question what is he answer a sluggard how very pleasant it would have been to hear that of oneself it would mean that i was positively defined it would mean that there was something to say about me sluggardwhy it is a calling and vocation it is a career do not jest it is so i should then be a member of the best club by right and should find my occupation in continually respecting myself i knew a gentleman who prided himself all his life on being a connoisseur of lafitte he considered this as his positive virtue and never doubted himself he died not simply with a tranquil but with a triumphant conscience and he was quite right too then i should have chosen a career for myself i should have been a sluggard and a glutton not a simple one but for instance one with sympathies for everything good and beautiful how do you like that i have long had visions of it that good and beautiful weighs heavily on my mind at forty but that is at forty thenoh then it would have been different i should have found for myself a form of activity in keeping with it to be precise drinking to the health of everything good and beautiful i should have snatched at every opportunity to drop a tear into my glass and then to drain it to all that is good and beautiful i should then have turned everything into the good and the beautiful in the nastiest unquestionable trash i should have sought out the good and the beautiful i should have exuded tears like a wet sponge an artist for instance paints a picture worthy of gay at once i drink to the health of the artist who painted the picture worthy of gay because i love all that is good and beautiful an author has written as you will at once i drink to the health of any one you will because i love all that is good and beautiful i should claim respect for doing so i should persecute any one who would not show me respect i should live at ease i should die with dignity why it is charming perfectly charming and what a good round belly i should have grown what a treble chin i should have established what a ruby nose i should have coloured for myself so that every one would have said looking at me here is an asset here is something real and solid and say what you like it is very agreeable to hear such remarks about oneself in this negative age vii but these are all golden dreams oh tell me who was it first announced who was it first proclaimed that man only does nasty things because he does not know his own interests and that if he were enlightened if his eyes were opened to his real normal interests man would at once cease to do nasty things would at once become good and noble because being enlightened and understanding his real advantage he would see his own advantage in the good and nothing else and we all know that not one man can consciously act against his own interests consequently so to say through necessity he would begin doing good oh the babe oh the pure innocent child why in the first place when in all these thousands of years has there been a time when man has acted only from his own interest what is to be done with the millions of facts that bear witness that men consciously that is fully understanding their real interests have left them in the background and have rushed headlong on another path to meet peril and danger compelled to this course by nobody and by nothing but as it were simply disliking the beaten track and have obstinately wilfully struck out another difficult absurd way seeking it almost in the darkness so i suppose this obstinacy and perversity were pleasanter to them than any advantage advantage what is advantage and will you take it upon yourself to define with perfect accuracy in what the advantage of man consists and what if it so happens that a mans advantage sometimes not only may but even must consist in his desiring in certain cases what is harmful to himself and not advantageous and if so if there can be such a case the whole principle falls into dust what do you thinkare there such cases you laugh laugh away gentlemen but only answer me have mans advantages been reckoned up with perfect certainty are there not some which not only have not been included but cannot possibly be included under any classification you see you gentlemen have to the best of my knowledge taken your whole register of human advantages from the averages of statistical figures and politicoeconomical formulas your advantages are prosperity wealth freedom peaceand so on and so on so that the man who should for instance go openly and knowingly in opposition to all that list would to your thinking and indeed mine too of course be an obscurantist or an absolute madman would not he but you know this is what is surprising why does it so happen that all these statisticians sages and lovers of humanity when they reckon up human advantages invariably leave out one they dont even take it into their reckoning in the form in which it should be taken and the whole reckoning depends upon that it would be no great matter they would simply have to take it this advantage and add it to the list but the trouble is that this strange advantage does not fall under any classification and is not in place in any list i have a friend for instance ech gentlemen but of course he is your friend too and indeed there is no one no one to whom he is not a friend when he prepares for any undertaking this gentleman immediately explains to you elegantly and clearly exactly how he must act in accordance with the laws of reason and truth what is more he will talk to you with excitement and passion of the true normal interests of man with irony he will upbraid the shortsighted fools who do not understand their own interests nor the true significance of virtue and within a quarter of an hour without any sudden outside provocation but simply through something inside him which is stronger than all his interests he will go off on quite a different tackthat is act in direct opposition to what he has just been saying about himself in opposition to the laws of reason in opposition to his own advantage in fact in opposition to everything i warn you that my friend is a compound personality and therefore it is difficult to blame him as an individual the fact is gentlemen it seems there must really exist something that is dearer to almost every man than his greatest advantages or not to be illogical there is a most advantageous advantage the very one omitted of which we spoke just now which is more important and more advantageous than all other advantages for the sake of which a man if necessary is ready to act in opposition to all laws that is in opposition to reason honour peace prosperityin fact in opposition to all those excellent and useful things if only he can attain that fundamental most advantageous advantage which is dearer to him than all yes but its advantage all the same you will retort but excuse me ill make the point clear and it is not a case of playing upon words what matters is that this advantage is remarkable from the very fact that it breaks down all our classifications and continually shatters every system constructed by lovers of mankind for the benefit of mankind in fact it upsets everything but before i mention this advantage to you i want to compromise myself personally and therefore i boldly declare that all these fine systems all these theories for explaining to mankind their real normal interests in order that inevitably striving to pursue these interests they may at once become good and nobleare in my opinion so far mere logical exercises yes logical exercises why to maintain this theory of the regeneration of mankind by means of the pursuit of his own advantage is to my mind almost the same thing as as to affirm for instance following buckle that through civilization mankind becomes softer and consequently less bloodthirsty and less fitted for warfare logically it does seem to follow from his arguments but man has such a predilection for systems and abstract deductions that he is ready to distort the truth intentionally he is ready to deny the evidence of his senses only to justify his logic i take this example because it is the most glaring instance of it only look about you blood is being spilt in streams and in the merriest way as though it were champagne take the whole of the nineteenth century in which buckle lived take napoleonthe great and also the present one take north americathe eternal union take the farce of schleswigholstein and what is it that civilization softens in us the only gain of civilization for mankind is the greater capacity for variety of sensationsand absolutely nothing more and through the development of this manysidedness man may come to finding enjoyment in bloodshed in fact this has already happened to him have you noticed that it is the most civilized gentlemen who have been the subtlest slaughterers to whom the attilas and stenka razins could not hold a candle and if they are not so conspicuous as the attilas and stenka razins it is simply because they are so often met with are so ordinary and have become so familiar to us in any case civilization has made mankind if not more bloodthirsty at least more vilely more loathsomely bloodthirsty in old days he saw justice in bloodshed and with his conscience at peace exterminated those he thought proper now we do think bloodshed abominable and yet we engage in this abomination and with more energy than ever which is worse decide that for yourselves they say that cleopatra excuse an instance from roman history was fond of sticking gold pins into her slavegirls breasts and derived gratification from their screams and writhings you will say that that was in the comparatively barbarous times that these are barbarous times too because also comparatively speaking pins are stuck in even now that though man has now learned to see more clearly than in barbarous ages he is still far from having learnt to act as reason and science would dictate but yet you are fully convinced that he will be sure to learn when he gets rid of certain old bad habits and when common sense and science have completely reeducated human nature and turned it in a normal direction you are confident that then man will cease from intentional error and will so to say be compelled not to want to set his will against his normal interests that is not all then you say science itself will teach man though to my mind its a superfluous luxury that he never has really had any caprice or will of his own and that he himself is something of the nature of a pianokey or the stop of an organ and that there are besides things called the laws of nature so that everything he does is not done by his willing it but is done of itself by the laws of nature consequently we have only to discover these laws of nature and man will no longer have to answer for his actions and life will become exceedingly easy for him all human actions will then of course be tabulated according to these laws mathematically like tables of logarithms up to and entered in an index or better still there would be published certain edifying works of the nature of encyclopdic lexicons in which everything will be so clearly calculated and explained that there will be no more incidents or adventures in the world thenthis is all what you saynew economic relations will be established all readymade and worked out with mathematical exactitude so that every possible question will vanish in the twinkling of an eye simply because every possible answer to it will be provided then the palace of crystal will be built then in fact those will be halcyon days of course there is no guaranteeing this is my comment that it will not be for instance frightfully dull then for what will one have to do when everything will be calculated and tabulated but on the other hand everything will be extraordinarily rational of course boredom may lead you to anything it is boredom sets one sticking golden pins into people but all that would not matter what is bad this is my comment again is that i dare say people will be thankful for the gold pins then man is stupid you know phenomenally stupid or rather he is not at all stupid but he is so ungrateful that you could not find another like him in all creation i for instance would not be in the least surprised if all of a sudden propos of nothing in the midst of general prosperity a gentleman with an ignoble or rather with a reactionary and ironical countenance were to arise and putting his arms akimbo say to us all i say gentlemen hadnt we better kick over the whole show and scatter rationalism to the winds simply to send these logarithms to the devil and to enable us to live once more at our own sweet foolish will that again would not matter but what is annoying is that he would be sure to find followerssuch is the nature of man and all that for the most foolish reason which one would think was hardly worth mentioning that is that man everywhere and at all times whoever he may be has preferred to act as he chose and not in the least as his reason and advantage dictated and one may choose what is contrary to ones own interests and sometimes one positively ought that is my idea ones own free unfettered choice ones own caprice however wild it may be ones own fancy worked up at times to frenzyis that very most advantageous advantage which we have overlooked which comes under no classification and against which all systems and theories are continually being shattered to atoms and how do these wiseacres know that man wants a normal a virtuous choice what has made them conceive that man must want a rationally advantageous choice what man wants is simply independent choice whatever that independence may cost and wherever it may lead and choice of course the devil only knows what choice viii ha ha ha but you know there is no such thing as choice in reality say what you like you will interpose with a chuckle science has succeeded in so far analysing man that we know already that choice and what is called freedom of will is nothing else than stay gentlemen i meant to begin with that myself i confess i was rather frightened i was just going to say that the devil only knows what choice depends on and that perhaps that was a very good thing but i remembered the teaching of science and pulled myself up and here you have begun upon it indeed if there really is some day discovered a formula for all our desires and capricesthat is an explanation of what they depend upon by what laws they arise how they develop what they are aiming at in one case and in another and so on that is a real mathematical formulathen most likely man will at once cease to feel desire indeed he will be certain to for who would want to choose by rule besides he will at once be transformed from a human being into an organstop or something of the sort for what is a man without desires without free will and without choice if not a stop in an organ what do you think let us reckon the chancescan such a thing happen or not hm you decide our choice is usually mistaken from a false view of our advantage we sometimes choose absolute nonsense because in our foolishness we see in that nonsense the easiest means for attaining a supposed advantage but when all that is explained and worked out on paper which is perfectly possible for it is contemptible and senseless to suppose that some laws of nature man will never understand then certainly socalled desires will no longer exist for if a desire should come into conflict with reason we shall then reason and not desire because it will be impossible retaining our reason to be senseless in our desires and in that way knowingly act against reason and desire to injure ourselves and as all choice and reasoning can be really calculatedbecause there will some day be discovered the laws of our socalled free willso joking apart there may one day be something like a table constructed of them so that we really shall choose in accordance with it if for instance some day they calculate and prove to me that i made a long nose at some one because i could not help making a long nose at him and that i had to do it in that particular way what freedom is left me especially if i am a learned man and have taken my degree somewhere then i should be able to calculate my whole life for thirty years beforehand in short if this could be arranged there would be nothing left for us to do anyway we should have to understand that and in fact we ought unwearyingly to repeat to ourselves that at such and such a time and in such and such circumstances nature does not ask our leave that we have got to take her as she is and not fashion her to suit our fancy and if we really aspire to formulas and tables of rules and well even to the chemical retort theres no help for it we must accept the retort too or else it will be accepted without our consent yes but here i come to a stop gentlemen you must excuse me for being overphilosophical its the result of forty years underground allow me to indulge my fancy you see gentlemen reason is an excellent thing theres no disputing that but reason is nothing but reason and satisfies only the rational side of mans nature while will is a manifestation of the whole life that is of the whole human life including reason and all the impulses and although our life in this manifestation of it is often worthless yet it is life and not simply extracting square roots here i for instance quite naturally want to live in order to satisfy all my capacities for life and not simply my capacity for reasoning that is not simply one twentieth of my capacity for life what does reason know reason only knows what it has succeeded in learning some things perhaps it will never learn this is a poor comfort but why not say so frankly and human nature acts as a whole with everything that is in it consciously or unconsciously and even if it goes wrong it lives i suspect gentlemen that you are looking at me with compassion you tell me again that an enlightened and developed man such in short as the future man will be cannot consciously desire anything disadvantageous to himself that that can be proved mathematically i thoroughly agree it canby mathematics but i repeat for the hundredth time there is one case one only when man may consciously purposely desire what is injurious to himself what is stupid very stupidsimply in order to have the right to desire for himself even what is very stupid and not to be bound by an obligation to desire only what is sensible of course this very stupid thing this caprice of ours may be in reality gentlemen more advantageous for us than anything else on earth especially in certain cases and in particular it may be more advantageous than any advantage even when it does us obvious harm and contradicts the soundest conclusions of our reason concerning our advantagefor in any circumstances it preserves for us what is most precious and most importantthat is our personality our individuality some you see maintain that this really is the most precious thing for mankind choice can of course if it chooses be in agreement with reason and especially if this be not abused but kept within bounds it is profitable and sometimes even praiseworthy but very often and even most often choice is utterly and stubbornly opposed to reason and and do you know that that too is profitable sometimes even praiseworthy gentlemen let us suppose that man is not stupid indeed one cannot refuse to suppose that if only from the one consideration that if man is stupid then who is wise but if he is not stupid he is monstrously ungrateful phenomenally ungrateful in fact i believe that the best definition of man is the ungrateful biped but that is not all that is not his worst defect his worst defect is his perpetual moral obliquity perpetualfrom the days of the flood to the schleswigholstein period moral obliquity and consequently lack of good sense for it has long been accepted that lack of good sense is due to no other cause than moral obliquity put it to the test and cast your eyes upon the history of mankind what will you see is it a grand spectacle grand if you like take the colossus of rhodes for instance thats worth something with good reason mr anaevsky testifies of it that some say that it is the work of mans hands while others maintain that it has been created by nature herself is it manycoloured may be it is manycoloured too if one takes the dress uniforms military and civilian of all peoples in all agesthat alone is worth something and if you take the undress uniforms you will never get to the end of it no historian would be equal to the job is it monotonous may be its monotonous too its fighting and fighting they are fighting now they fought first and they fought lastyou will admit that it is almost too monotonous in short one may say anything about the history of the worldanything that might enter the most disordered imagination the only thing one cant say is that its rational the very word sticks in ones throat and indeed this is the odd thing that is continually happening there are continually turning up in life moral and rational persons sages and lovers of humanity who make it their object to live all their lives as morally and rationally as possible to be so to speak a light to their neighbours simply in order to show them that it is possible to live morally and rationally in this world and yet we all know that those very people sooner or later have been false to themselves playing some queer trick often a most unseemly one now i ask you what can be expected of man since he is a being endowed with such strange qualities shower upon him every earthly blessing drown him in a sea of happiness so that nothing but bubbles of bliss can be seen on the surface give him economic prosperity such that he should have nothing else to do but sleep eat cakes and busy himself with the continuation of his species and even then out of sheer ingratitude sheer spite man would play you some nasty trick he would even risk his cakes and would deliberately desire the most fatal rubbish the most uneconomical absurdity simply to introduce into all this positive good sense his fatal fantastic element it is just his fantastic dreams his vulgar folly that he will desire to retain simply in order to prove to himselfas though that were so necessarythat men still are men and not the keys of a piano which the laws of nature threaten to control so completely that soon one will be able to desire nothing but by the calendar and that is not all even if man really were nothing but a pianokey even if this were proved to him by natural science and mathematics even then he would not become reasonable but would purposely do something perverse out of simple ingratitude simply to gain his point and if he does not find means he will contrive destruction and chaos will contrive sufferings of all sorts only to gain his point he will launch a curse upon the world and as only man can curse it is his privilege the primary distinction between him and other animals may be by his curse alone he will attain his objectthat is convince himself that he is a man and not a pianokey if you say that all this too can be calculated and tabulatedchaos and darkness and curses so that the mere possibility of calculating it all beforehand would stop it all and reason would reassert itself then man would purposely go mad in order to be rid of reason and gain his point i believe in it i answer for it for the whole work of man really seems to consist in nothing but proving to himself every minute that he is a man and not a pianokey it may be at the cost of his skin it may be by cannibalism and this being so can one help being tempted to rejoice that it has not yet come off and that desire still depends on something we dont know you will scream at me that is if you condescend to do so that no one is touching my free will that all they are concerned with is that my will should of itself of its own free will coincide with my own normal interests with the laws of nature and arithmetic good heavens gentlemen what sort of free will is left when we come to tabulation and arithmetic when it will all be a case of twice two make four twice two makes four without my will as if free will meant that ix gentlemen i am joking and i know myself that my jokes are not brilliant but you know one cant take everything as a joke i am perhaps jesting against the grain gentlemen i am tormented by questions answer them for me you for instance want to cure men of their old habits and reform their will in accordance with science and good sense but how do you know not only that it is possible but also that it is desirable to reform man in that way and what leads you to the conclusion that mans inclinations need reforming in short how do you know that such a reformation will be a benefit to man and to go to the root of the matter why are you so positively convinced that not to act against his real normal interests guaranteed by the conclusions of reason and arithmetic is certainly always advantageous for man and must always be a law for mankind so far you know this is only your supposition it may be the law of logic but not the law of humanity you think gentlemen perhaps that i am mad allow me to defend myself i agree that man is preeminently a creative animal predestined to strive consciously for an object and to engage in engineeringthat is incessantly and eternally to make new roads wherever they may lead but the reason why he wants sometimes to go off at a tangent may just be that he is predestined to make the road and perhaps too that however stupid the direct practical man may be the thought sometimes will occur to him that the road almost always does lead somewhere and that the destination it leads to is less important than the process of making it and that the chief thing is to save the wellconducted child from despising engineering and so giving way to the fatal idleness which as we all know is the mother of all the vices man likes to make roads and to create that is a fact beyond dispute but why has he such a passionate love for destruction and chaos also tell me that but on that point i want to say a couple of words myself may it not be that he loves chaos and destruction there can be no disputing that he does sometimes love it because he is instinctively afraid of attaining his object and completing the edifice he is constructing who knows perhaps he only loves that edifice from a distance and is by no means in love with it at close quarters perhaps he only loves building it and does not want to live in it but will leave it when completed for the use of les animaux domestiquessuch as the ants the sheep and so on now the ants have quite a different taste they have a marvellous edifice of that pattern which endures for everthe antheap with the antheap the respectable race of ants began and with the antheap they will probably end which does the greatest credit to their perseverance and good sense but man is a frivolous and incongruous creature and perhaps like a chess player loves the process of the game not the end of it and who knows there is no saying with certainty perhaps the only goal on earth to which mankind is striving lies in this incessant process of attaining in other words in life itself and not in the thing to be attained which must always be expressed as a formula as positive as twice two makes four and such positiveness is not life gentlemen but is the beginning of death anyway man has always been afraid of this mathematical certainty and i am afraid of it now granted that man does nothing but seek that mathematical certainty he traverses oceans sacrifices his life in the quest but to succeed really to find it he dreads i assure you he feels that when he has found it there will be nothing for him to look for when workmen have finished their work they do at least receive their pay they go to the tavern then they are taken to the policestationand there is occupation for a week but where can man go anyway one can observe a certain awkwardness about him when he has attained such objects he loves the process of attaining but does not quite like to have attained and that of course is very absurd in fact man is a comical creature there seems to be a kind of jest in it all but yet mathematical certainty is after all something insufferable twice two makes four seems to me simply a piece of insolence twice two makes four is a pert coxcomb who stands with arms akimbo barring your path and spitting i admit that twice two makes four is an excellent thing but if we are to give everything its due twice two makes five is sometimes a very charming thing too and why are you so firmly so triumphantly convinced that only the normal and the positivein other words only what is conducive to welfareis for the advantage of man is not reason in error as regards advantage does not man perhaps love something besides wellbeing perhaps he is just as fond of suffering perhaps suffering is just as great a benefit to him as wellbeing man is sometimes extraordinarily passionately in love with suffering and that is a fact there is no need to appeal to universal history to prove that only ask yourself if you are a man and have lived at all as far as my personal opinion is concerned to care only for wellbeing seems to me positively illbred whether its good or bad it is sometimes very pleasant too to smash things i hold no brief for suffering nor for wellbeing either i am standing for my caprice and for its being guaranteed to me when necessary suffering would be out of place in vaudevilles for instance i know that in the palace of crystal it is unthinkable suffering means doubt negation and what would be the good of a palace of crystal if there could be any doubt about it and yet i think man will never renounce real suffering that is destruction and chaos why suffering is the sole origin of consciousness though i did lay it down at the beginning that consciousness is the greatest misfortune for man yet i know man prizes it and would not give it up for any satisfaction consciousness for instance is infinitely superior to twice two makes four once you have mathematical certainty there is nothing left to do or to understand there will be nothing left but to bottle up your five senses and plunge into contemplation while if you stick to consciousness even though the same result is attained you can at least flog yourself at times and that will at any rate liven you up reactionary as it is corporal punishment is better than nothing x you believe in a palace of crystal that can never be destroyeda palace at which one will not be able to put out ones tongue or make a long nose on the sly and perhaps that is just why i am afraid of this edifice that it is of crystal and can never be destroyed and that one cannot put ones tongue out at it even on the sly you see if it were not a palace but a henhouse i might creep into it to avoid getting wet and yet i would not call the henhouse a palace out of gratitude to it for keeping me dry you laugh and say that in such circumstances a henhouse is as good as a mansion yes i answer if one had to live simply to keep out of the rain but what is to be done if i have taken it into my head that that is not the only object in life and that if one must live one had better live in a mansion that is my choice my desire you will only eradicate it when you have changed my preference well do change it allure me with something else give me another ideal but meanwhile i will not take a henhouse for a mansion the palace of crystal may be an idle dream it may be that it is inconsistent with the laws of nature and that i have invented it only through my own stupidity through the oldfashioned irrational habits of my generation but what does it matter to me that it is inconsistent that makes no difference since it exists in my desires or rather exists as long as my desires exist perhaps you are laughing again laugh away i will put up with any mockery rather than pretend that i am satisfied when i am hungry i know anyway that i will not be put off with a compromise with a recurring zero simply because it is consistent with the laws of nature and actually exists i will not accept as the crown of my desires a block of buildings with tenements for the poor on a lease of a thousand years and perhaps with a signboard of a dentist hanging out destroy my desires eradicate my ideals show me something better and i will follow you you will say perhaps that it is not worth your trouble but in that case i can give you the same answer we are discussing things seriously but if you wont deign to give me your attention i will drop your acquaintance i can retreat into my underground hole but while i am alive and have desires i would rather my hand were withered off than bring one brick to such a building dont remind me that i have just rejected the palace of crystal for the sole reason that one cannot put out ones tongue at it i did not say because i am so fond of putting my tongue out perhaps the thing i resented was that of all your edifices there has not been one at which one could not put out ones tongue on the contrary i would let my tongue be cut off out of gratitude if things could be so arranged that i should lose all desire to put it out it is not my fault that things cannot be so arranged and that one must be satisfied with model flats then why am i made with such desires can i have been constructed simply in order to come to the conclusion that all my construction is a cheat can this be my whole purpose i do not believe it but do you know what i am convinced that we underground folk ought to be kept on a curb though we may sit forty years underground without speaking when we do come out into the light of day and break out we talk and talk and talk xi the long and the short of it is gentlemen that it is better to do nothing better conscious inertia and so hurrah for underground though i have said that i envy the normal man to the last drop of my bile yet i should not care to be in his place such as he is now though i shall not cease envying him no no anyway the underground life is more advantageous there at any rate one can oh but even now i am lying i am lying because i know myself that it is not underground that is better but something different quite different for which i am thirsting but which i cannot find damn underground i will tell you another thing that would be better and that is if i myself believed in anything of what i have just written i swear to you gentlemen there is not one thing not one word of what i have written that i really believe that is i believe it perhaps but at the same time i feel and suspect that i am lying like a cobbler then why have you written all this you will say to me i ought to put you underground for forty years without anything to do and then come to you in your cellar to find out what stage you have reached how can a man be left with nothing to do for forty years isnt that shameful isnt that humiliating you will say perhaps wagging your heads contemptuously you thirst for life and try to settle the problems of life by a logical tangle and how persistent how insolent are your sallies and at the same time what a scare you are in you talk nonsense and are pleased with it you say impudent things and are in continual alarm and apologizing for them you declare that you are afraid of nothing and at the same time try to ingratiate yourself in our good opinion you declare that you are gnashing your teeth and at the same time you try to be witty so as to amuse us you know that your witticisms are not witty but you are evidently well satisfied with their literary value you may perhaps have really suffered but you have no respect for your own suffering you may have sincerity but you have no modesty out of the pettiest vanity you expose your sincerity to publicity and ignominy you doubtlessly mean to say something but hide your last word through fear because you have not the resolution to utter it and only have a cowardly impudence you boast of consciousness but you are not sure of your ground for though your mind works yet your heart is darkened and corrupt and you cannot have a full genuine consciousness without a pure heart and how intrusive you are how you insist and grimace lies lies lies of course i have myself made up all the things you say that too is from underground i have been for forty years listening to you through a crack under the floor i have invented them myself there was nothing else i could invent it is no wonder that i have learned it by heart and it has taken a literary form but can you really be so credulous as to think that i will print all this and give it to you to read too and another problem why do i call you gentlemen why do i address you as though you really were my readers such confessions as i intend to make are never printed nor given to other people to read anyway i am not strongminded enough for that and i dont see why i should be but you see a fancy has occurred to me and i want to realize it at all costs let me explain every man has reminiscences which he would not tell to every one but only to his friends he has other matters in his mind which he would not reveal even to his friends but only to himself and that in secret but there are other things which a man is afraid to tell even to himself and every decent man has a number of such things stored away in his mind the more decent he is the greater the number of such things in his mind anyway i have only lately determined to remember some of my early adventures till now i have always avoided them even with a certain uneasiness now when i am not only recalling them but have actually decided to write an account of them i want to try the experiment whether one can even with oneself be perfectly open and not take fright at the whole truth i will observe in parenthesis that heine says that a true autobiography is almost an impossibility and that man is bound to lie about himself he considers that rousseau certainly told lies about himself in his confessions and even intentionally lied out of vanity i am convinced that heine is right i quite understand how sometimes one may out of sheer vanity attribute regular crimes to oneself and indeed i can very well conceive that kind of vanity but heine judged of people who made their confessions to the public i write only for myself and i wish to declare once and for all that if i write as though i were addressing readers that is simply because it is easier for me to write in that form it is a form an empty formi shall never have readers i have made this plain already i dont wish to be hampered by any restrictions in the compilation of my notes i shall not attempt any system or method i will jot things down as i remember them but here perhaps some one will catch at the word and ask me if you really dont reckon on readers why do you make such compacts with yourselfand on paper toothat is that you wont attempt any system or method that you jot things down as you remember them and so on and so on why are you explaining why do you apologize well there it is i answer there is a whole psychology in all this though perhaps it is simply that i am a coward and perhaps that i purposely imagine an audience before me in order that i may be more dignified while i write there are perhaps thousands of reasons again what is my object precisely in writing if it is not for the benefit of the public why should i not simply recall these incidents in my own mind without putting them on paper quite so but yet it is more imposing on paper there is something more impressive in it i shall be better able to criticize myself and improve my style besides i shall perhaps obtain actual relief from writing today for instance i am particularly oppressed by one memory of a distant past it came back vividly to my mind a few days ago and has remained haunting me like an annoying tune that one cannot get rid of and yet i must get rid of it somehow i have hundreds of such reminiscences but at times some one stands out from the hundred and oppresses me for some reason i believe that if i write it down i should get rid of it why not try besides i am bored and i never have anything to do writing will be a sort of work they say work makes man kindhearted and honest well here is a chance for me anyway snow is falling today yellow and dingy it fell yesterday too and a few days ago i fancy it is the wet snow that has reminded me of that incident which i cannot shake off now and so let it be a story propos of the falling snow part ii propos of the wet snow when from dark errors subjugation my words of passionate exhortation had wrenched thy fainting spirit free and writhing prone in thine affliction thou didst recall with malediction the vice that had encompassed thee and when thy slumbering conscience fretting by recollections torturing flame thou didst reveal the hideous setting of thy lifes current ere i came when suddenly i saw thee sicken and weeping hide thine anguished face revolted maddened horrorstricken at memories of foul disgrace nekrassov translated by juliet soskice i at that time i was only twentyfour my life was even then gloomy illregulated and as solitary as that of a savage i made friends with no one and positively avoided talking and buried myself more and more in my hole at work in the office i never looked at any one and i was perfectly well aware that my companions looked upon me not only as a queer fellow but even looked upon mei always fancied thiswith a sort of loathing i sometimes wondered why it was that nobody except me fancied that he was looked upon with aversion one of the clerks had a most repulsive pockmarked face which looked positively villainous i believe i should not have dared to look at any one with such an unsightly countenance another had such a very dirty old uniform that there was an unpleasant odour in his proximity yet not one of these gentlemen showed the slightest selfconsciousnesseither about their clothes or their countenance or their character in any way neither of them ever imagined that they were looked at with repulsion if they had imagined it they would not have mindedso long as their superiors did not look at them in that way it is clear to me now that owing to my unbounded vanity and to the high standard i set for myself i often looked at myself with furious discontent which verged on loathing and so i inwardly attributed the same feeling to every one i hated my face for instance i thought it disgusting and even suspected that there was something base in my expression and so every day when i turned up at the office i tried to behave as independently as possible and to assume a lofty expression so that i might not be suspected of being abject my face may be ugly i thought but let it be lofty expressive and above all extremely intelligent but i was positively and painfully certain that it was impossible for my countenance ever to express those qualities and what was worst of all i thought it actually stupid looking and i would have been quite satisfied if i could have looked intelligent in fact i would even have put up with looking base if at the same time my face could have been thought strikingly intelligent of course i hated my fellow clerks one and all and i despised them all yet at the same time i was as it were afraid of them in fact it happened at times that i thought more highly of them than of myself it somehow happened quite suddenly that i alternated between despising them and thinking them superior to myself a cultivated and decent man cannot be vain without setting a fearfully high standard for himself and without despising and almost hating himself at certain moments but whether i despised them or thought them superior i dropped my eyes almost every time i met any one i even made experiments whether i could face so and sos looking at me and i was always the first to drop my eyes this worried me to distraction i had a sickly dread too of being ridiculous and so had a slavish passion for the conventional in everything external i loved to fall into the common rut and had a wholehearted terror of any kind of eccentricity in myself but how could i live up to it i was morbidly sensitive as a man of our age should be they were all stupid and as like one another as so many sheep perhaps i was the only one in the office who fancied that i was a coward and a slave and i fancied it just because i was more highly developed but it was not only that i fancied it it really was so i was a coward and a slave i say this without the slightest embarrassment every decent man of our age must be a coward and a slave that is his normal condition of that i am firmly persuaded he is made and constructed to that very end and not only at the present time owing to some casual circumstances but always at all times a decent man is bound to be a coward and a slave it is the law of nature for all decent people all over the earth if any one of them happens to be valiant about something he need not be comforted nor carried away by that he would show the white feather just the same before something else that is how it invariably and inevitably ends only donkeys and mules are valiant and they only till they are pushed up to the wall it is not worth while to pay attention to them for they really are of no consequence another circumstance too worried me in those days that there was no one like me and i was unlike any one else i am alone and they are every one i thoughtand pondered from that it is evident that i was still a youngster the very opposite sometimes happened it was loathsome sometimes to go to the office things reached such a point that i often came home ill but all at once propos of nothing there would come a phase of scepticism and indifference everything happened in phases to me and i would laugh myself at my intolerance and fastidiousness i would reproach myself with being romantic at one time i was unwilling to speak to any one while at other times i would not only talk but go to the length of contemplating making friends with them all my fastidiousness would suddenly for no rhyme or reason vanish who knows perhaps i never had really had it and it had simply been affected and got out of books i have not decided that question even now once i quite made friends with them visited their homes played preference drank vodka talked of promotions but here let me make a digression we russians speaking generally have never had those foolish transcendental romanticsgerman and still more frenchon whom nothing produces any effect if there were an earthquake if all france perished at the barricades they would still be the same they would not even have the decency to affect a change but would still go on singing their transcendental songs to the hour of their death because they are fools we in russia have no fools that is well known that is what distinguishes us from foreign lands consequently these transcendental natures are not found amongst us in their pure form the idea that they are is due to our realistic journalists and critics of that day always on the look out for kostanzhoglos and uncle pyotr ivanitchs and foolishly accepting them as our ideal they have slandered our romantics taking them for the same transcendental sort as in germany or france on the contrary the characteristics of our romantics are absolutely and directly opposed to the transcendental european type and no european standard can be applied to them allow me to make use of this word romantican oldfashioned and much respected word which has done good service and is familiar to all the characteristics of our romantic are to understand everything to see everything and to see it often incomparably more clearly than our most realistic minds see it to refuse to accept anyone or anything but at the same time not to despise anything to give way to yield from policy never to lose sight of a useful practical object such as rentfree quarters at the government expense pensions decorations to keep their eye on that object through all the enthusiasms and volumes of lyrical poems and at the same time to preserve the good and the beautiful inviolate within them to the hour of their death and to preserve themselves also incidentally like some precious jewel wrapped in cotton wool if only for the benefit of the good and the beautiful our romantic is a man of great breadth and the greatest rogue of all our rogues i assure you i can assure you from experience indeed of course that is if he is intelligent but what am i saying the romantic is always intelligent and i only meant to observe that although we have had foolish romantics they dont count and they were only so because in the flower of their youth they degenerated into germans and to preserve their precious jewel more comfortably settled somewhere out thereby preference in weimar or the black forest i for instance genuinely despised my official work and did not openly abuse it simply because i was in it myself and got a salary for it anyway take note i did not openly abuse it our romantic would rather go out of his minda thing however which very rarely happensthan take to open abuse unless he had some other career in view and he is never kicked out at most they would take him to the lunatic asylum as the king of spain if he should go very mad but it is only the thin fair people who go out of their minds in russia innumerable romantics attain later in life to considerable rank in the service their manysidedness is remarkable and what a faculty they have for the most contradictory sensations i was comforted by this thought even in those days and i am of the same opinion now that is why there are so many broad natures among us who never lose their ideal even in the depths of degradation and though they never stir a finger for their ideal though they are arrant thieves and knaves yet they tearfully cherish their first ideal and are extraordinarily honest at heart yes it is only among us that the most incorrigible rogue can be absolutely and loftily honest at heart without in the least ceasing to be a rogue i repeat our romantics frequently become such accomplished rascals i use the term rascals affectionately suddenly display such a sense of reality and practical knowledge that their bewildered superiors and the public generally can only ejaculate in amazement their manysidedness is really amazing and goodness knows what it may develop into later on and what the future has in store for us it is not a poor material i do not say this from any foolish or boastful patriotism but i feel sure that you are again imagining that i am joking or perhaps its just the contrary and you are convinced that i really think so anyway gentlemen i shall welcome both views as an honour and a special favour and do forgive my digression i did not of course maintain friendly relations with my comrades and soon was at loggerheads with them and in my youth and inexperience i even gave up bowing to them as though i had cut off all relations that however only happened to me once as a rule i was always alone in the first place i spent most of my time at home reading i tried to stifle all that was continually seething within me by means of external impressions and the only external means i had was reading reading of course was a great helpexciting me giving me pleasure and pain but at times it bored me fearfully one longed for movement in spite of everything and i plunged all at once into dark underground loathsome vice of the pettiest kind my wretched passions were acute smarting from my continual sickly irritability i had hysterical impulses with tears and convulsions i had no resource except reading that is there was nothing in my surroundings which i could respect and which attracted me i was overwhelmed with depression too i had an hysterical craving for incongruity and for contrast and so i took to vice i have not said all this to justify myself but no i am lying i did want to justify myself i make that little observation for my own benefit gentlemen i dont want to lie i vowed to myself i would not and so furtively timidly in solitude at night i indulged in filthy vice with a feeling of shame which never deserted me even at the most loathsome moments and which at such moments nearly made me curse already even then i had my underground world in my soul i was fearfully afraid of being seen of being met of being recognized i visited various obscure haunts one night as i was passing a tavern i saw through a lighted window some gentlemen fighting with billiard cues and saw one of them thrown out of window at other times i should have felt very much disgusted but i was in such a mood at the time that i actually envied the gentleman thrown out of windowand i envied him so much that i even went into the tavern and into the billiardroom perhaps i thought ill have a fight too and theyll throw me out of window i was not drunkbut what is one to dodepression will drive a man to such a pitch of hysteria but nothing happened it seemed that i was not even equal to being thrown out of window and i went away without having my fight an officer put me in my place from the first moment i was standing by the billiardtable and in my ignorance blocking up the way and he wanted to pass he took me by the shoulders and without a wordwithout a warning or explanationmoved me from where i was standing to another spot and passed by as though he had not noticed me i could have forgiven blows but i could not forgive his having moved me without noticing me devil knows what i would have given for a real regular quarrela more decent a more literary one so to speak i had been treated like a fly this officer was over six foot while i was a spindly little fellow but the quarrel was in my hands i had only to protest and i certainly would have been thrown out of the window but i changed my mind and preferred to beat a resentful retreat i went out of the tavern straight home confused and troubled and the next night i went out again with the same lewd intentions still more furtively abjectly and miserably than before as it were with tears in my eyesbut still i did go out again dont imagine though it was cowardice made me slink away from the officer i never have been a coward at heart though i have always been a coward in action dont be in a hurry to laughi assure you i can explain it all oh if only that officer had been one of the sort who would consent to fight a duel but no he was one of those gentlemen alas long extinct who preferred fighting with cues or like gogols lieutenant pirogov appealing to the police they did not fight duels and would have thought a duel with a civilian like me an utterly unseemly procedure in any caseand they looked upon the duel altogether as something impossible something freethinking and french but they were quite ready to bully especially when they were over six foot i did not slink away through cowardice but through an unbounded vanity i was afraid not of his six foot not of getting a sound thrashing and being thrown out of the window i should have had physical courage enough i assure you but i had not the moral courage what i was afraid of was that every one present from the insolent marker down to the lowest little stinking pimply clerk in a greasy collar would jeer at me and fail to understand when i began to protest and to address them in literary language for of the point of honournot of honour but of the point of honour point dhonneurone cannot speak among us except in literary language you cant allude to the point of honour in ordinary language i was fully convinced the sense of reality in spite of all my romanticism that they would all simply split their sides with laughter and that the officer would not simply beat me that is without insulting me but would certainly prod me in the back with his knee kick me round the billiard table and only then perhaps have pity and drop me out of the window of course this trivial incident could not with me end in that i often met that officer afterwards in the street and noticed him very carefully i am not quite sure whether he recognized me i imagine not i judge from certain signs but ii stared at him with spite and hatred and so it went on for several years my resentment grew even deeper with years at first i began making stealthy inquiries about this officer it was difficult for me to do so for i knew no one but one day i heard some one shout his surname in the street as i was following him at a distance as though i were tied to himand so i learnt his surname another time i followed him to his flat and for ten kopecks learned from the porter where he lived on which storey whether he lived alone or with others and so onin fact everything one could learn from a porter one morning though i had never tried my hand with the pen it suddenly occurred to me to write a satire on this officer in the form of a novel which would unmask his villainy i wrote the novel with relish i did unmask his villainy i even exaggerated it at first i so altered his surname that it could easily be recognized but on second thoughts i changed it and sent the story to the otetchestvenniya zapiski but at that time such attacks were not the fashion and my story was not printed that was a great vexation to me sometimes i was positively choked with resentment at last i determined to challenge my enemy to a duel i composed a splendid charming letter to him imploring him to apologize to me and hinting rather plainly at a duel in case of refusal the letter was so composed that if the officer had had the least understanding of the good and the beautiful he would certainly have flung himself on my neck and have offered me his friendship and how fine that would have been how we should have got on together he could have shielded me with his higher rank while i could have improved his mind with my culture and well my ideas and all sorts of things might have happened only fancy this was two years after his insult to me and my challenge would have been a ridiculous anachronism in spite of all the ingenuity of my letter in disguising and explaining away the anachronism but thank god to this day i thank the almighty with tears in my eyes i did not send the letter to him cold shivers run down my back when i think of what might have happened if i had sent it and all at once i revenged myself in the simplest way by a stroke of genius a brilliant thought suddenly dawned upon me sometimes on holidays i used to stroll along the sunny side of the nevsky about four oclock in the afternoon though it was hardly a stroll so much as a series of innumerable miseries humiliations and resentments but no doubt that was just what i wanted i used to wriggle along in a most unseemly fashion like an eel continually moving aside to make way for generals for officers of the guards and the hussars or for ladies at such minutes there used to be a convulsive twinge at my heart and i used to feel hot all down my back at the mere thought of the wretchedness of my attire of the wretchedness and abjectness of my little scurrying figure this was a regular martyrdom a continual intolerable humiliation at the thought which passed into an incessant and direct sensation that i was a mere fly in the eyes of all this world a nasty disgusting flymore intelligent more highly developed more refined in feeling than any of them of coursebut a fly that was continually making way for every one insulted and injured by every one why i inflicted this torture upon myself why i went to the nevsky i dont know i felt simply drawn there at every possible opportunity already then i began to experience a rush of the enjoyment of which i spoke in the first chapter after my affair with the officer i felt even more drawn there than before it was on the nevsky that i met him most frequently there i could admire him he too went there chiefly on holidays he too turned out of his path for generals and persons of high rank and he too wriggled between them like an eel but people like me or even better dressed like me he simply walked over he made straight for them as though there was nothing but empty space before him and never under any circumstances turned aside i gloated over my resentment watching him and always resentfully made way for him it exasperated me that even in the street i could not be on an even footing with him why must you invariably be the first to move aside i kept asking myself in hysterical rage waking up sometimes at three oclock in the morning why is it you and not he theres no regulation about it theres no written law let the making way be equal as it usually is when refined people meet he moves halfway and you move halfway you pass with mutual respect but that never happened and i always moved aside while he did not even notice my making way for him and lo and behold a bright idea dawned upon me what i thought if i meet him and dont move on one side what if i dont move aside on purpose even if i knock up against him how would that be this audacious idea took such a hold on me that it gave me no peace i was dreaming of it continually horribly and i purposely went more frequently to the nevsky in order to picture more vividly how i should do it when i did do it i was delighted this intention seemed to me more and more practical and possible of course i shall not really push him i thought already more goodnatured in my joy i will simply not turn aside will run up against him not very violently but just shouldering each otherjust as much as decency permits i will push against him just as much as he pushes against me at last i made up my mind completely but my preparations took a great deal of time to begin with when i carried out my plan i should need to be looking rather more decent and so i had to think of my getup in case of emergency if for instance there were any sort of public scandal and the public there is of the most recherch the countess walks there prince d walks there all the literary world is there i must be well dressed that inspires respect and of itself puts us on an equal footing in the eyes of society with this object i asked for some of my salary in advance and bought at tchurkins a pair of black gloves and a decent hat black gloves seemed to me both more dignified and bon ton than the lemoncoloured ones which i had contemplated at first the colour is too gaudy it looks as though one were trying to be conspicuous and i did not take the lemoncoloured ones i had got ready long beforehand a good shirt with white bone studs my overcoat was the only thing that held me back the coat in itself was a very good one it kept me warm but it was wadded and it had a raccoon collar which was the height of vulgarity i had to change the collar at any sacrifice and to have a beaver one like an officers for this purpose i began visiting the gostiny dvor and after several attempts i pitched upon a piece of cheap german beaver though these german beavers soon grow shabby and look wretched yet at first they look exceedingly well and i only needed it for one occasion i asked the price even so it was too expensive after thinking it over thoroughly i decided to sell my raccoon collar the rest of the moneya considerable sum for me i decided to borrow from anton antonitch syetotchkin my immediate superior an unassuming person though grave and judicious he never lent money to any one but i had on entering the service been specially recommended to him by an important personage who had got me my berth i was horribly worried to borrow from anton antonitch seemed to me monstrous and shameful i did not sleep for two or three nights indeed i did not sleep well at that time i was in a fever i had a vague sinking at my heart or else a sudden throbbing throbbing throbbing anton antonitch was surprised at first then he frowned then he reflected and did after all lend me the money receiving from me a written authorization to take from my salary a fortnight later the sum that he had lent me in this way everything was at last ready the handsome beaver replaced the meanlooking raccoon and i began by degrees to get to work it would never have done to act offhand at random the plan had to be carried out skilfully by degrees but i must confess that after many efforts i began to despair we simply could not run into each other i made every preparation i was quite determinedit seemed as though we should run into one another directlyand before i knew what i was doing i had stepped aside for him again and he had passed without noticing me i even prayed as i approached him that god would grant me determination one time i had made up my mind thoroughly but it ended in my stumbling and falling at his feet because at the very last instant when i was six inches from him my courage failed me he very calmly stepped over me while i flew on one side like a ball that night i was ill again feverish and delirious and suddenly it ended most happily the night before i had made up my mind not to carry out my fatal plan and to abandon it all and with that object i went to the nevsky for the last time just to see how i would abandon it all suddenly three paces from my enemy i unexpectedly made up my mindi closed my eyes and we ran full tilt shoulder to shoulder against one another i did not budge an inch and passed him on a perfectly equal footing he did not even look round and pretended not to notice it but he was only pretending i am convinced of that i am convinced of that to this day of course i got the worst of ithe was stronger but that was not the point the point was that i had attained my object i had kept up my dignity i had not yielded a step and had put myself publicly on an equal social footing with him i returned home feeling that i was fully avenged for everything i was delighted i was triumphant and sang italian arias of course i will not describe to you what happened to me three days later if you have read my first chapter you can guess that for yourself the officer was afterwards transferred i have not seen him now for fourteen years what is the dear fellow doing now whom is he walking over ii but the period of my dissipation would end and i always felt very sick afterwards it was followed by remorsei tried to drive it away i felt too sick by degrees however i grew used to that too i grew used to everything or rather i voluntarily resigned myself to enduring it but i had a means of escape that reconciled everythingthat was to find refuge in the good and the beautiful in dreams of course i was a terrible dreamer i would dream for three months on end tucked away in my corner and you may believe me that at those moments i had no resemblance to the gentleman who in the perturbation of his chicken heart put a collar of german beaver on his great coat i suddenly became a hero i would not have admitted my sixfoot lieutenant even if he had called on me i could not even picture him before me then what were my dreams and how i could satisfy myself with themit is hard to say now but at the time i was satisfied with them though indeed even now i am to some extent satisfied with them dreams were particularly sweet and vivid after a spell of dissipation they came with remorse and with tears with curses and transports there were moments of such positive intoxication of such happiness that there was not the faintest trace of irony within me on my honour i had faith hope love i believed blindly at such times that by some miracle by some external circumstance all this would suddenly open out expand that suddenly a vista of suitable activitybeneficent good and above all ready made what sort of activity i had no idea but the great thing was that it should be all ready for mewould rise up before meand i should come out into the light of day almost riding a white horse and crowned with laurel anything but the foremost place i could not conceive for myself and for that very reason i quite contentedly occupied the lowest in reality either to be a hero or to grovel in the mudthere was nothing between that was my ruin for when i was in the mud i comforted myself with the thought that at other times i was a hero and the hero was a cloak for the mud for an ordinary man it was shameful to defile himself but a hero was too lofty to be utterly defiled and so he might defile himself it is worth noting that these attacks of the good and the beautiful visited me even during the period of dissipation and just at the times when i was touching the bottom they came in separate spurts as though reminding me of themselves but did not banish the dissipation by their appearance on the contrary they seemed to add a zest to it by contrast and were only sufficiently present to serve as an appetizing sauce that sauce was made up of contradictions and sufferings of agonizing inward analysis and all these pangs and pinpricks gave a certain piquancy even a significance to my dissipationin fact completely answered the purpose of an appetizing sauce there was a certain depth of meaning in it and i could hardly have resigned myself to the simple vulgar direct debauchery of a clerk and have endured all the filthiness of it what could have allured me about it then and have drawn me at night into the street no i had a lofty way of getting out of it all and what lovingkindness oh lord what lovingkindness i felt at times in those dreams of mine in those flights into the good and the beautiful though it was fantastic love though it was never applied to anything human in reality yet there was so much of this love that one did not feel afterwards even the impulse to apply it in reality that would have been superfluous everything however passed satisfactorily by a lazy and fascinating transition into the sphere of art that is into the beautiful forms of life lying ready largely stolen from the poets and novelists and adapted to all sorts of needs and uses i for instance was triumphant over every one every one of course was in dust and ashes and was forced spontaneously to recognize my superiority and i forgave them all i was a poet and a grand gentleman i fell in love i came in for countless millions and immediately devoted them to humanity and at the same time i confessed before all the people my shameful deeds which of course were not merely shameful but had in them much that was good and beautiful something in the manfred style every one would kiss me and weep what idiots they would be if they did not while i should go barefoot and hungry preaching new ideas and fighting a victorious austerlitz against the obscurantists then the band would play a march an amnesty would be declared the pope would agree to retire from rome to brazil then there would be a ball for the whole of italy at the villa borghese on the shores of the lake of como the lake of como being for that purpose transferred to the neighbourhood of rome then would come a scene in the bushes and so on and so onas though you did not know all about it you will say that it is vulgar and contemptible to drag all this into public after all the tears and transports which i have myself confessed but why is it contemptible can you imagine that i am ashamed of it all and that it was stupider than anything in your life gentlemen and i can assure you that some of these fancies were by no means badly composed it did not all happen on the shores of lake como and yet you are rightit really is vulgar and contemptible and most contemptible of all it is that now i am attempting to justify myself to you and even more contemptible than that is my making this remark now but thats enough or there will be no end to it each step will be more contemptible than the last i could never stand more than three months of dreaming at a time without feeling an irresistible desire to plunge into society to plunge into society meant to visit my superior at the office anton antonitch syetotchkin he was the only permanent acquaintance i have had in my life and wonder at the fact myself now but i only went to see him when that phase came over me and when my dreams had reached such a point of bliss that it became essential at once to embrace my fellows and all mankind and for that purpose i needed at least one human being actually existing i had to call on anton antonitch however on tuesdayhis athome day so i had always to time my passionate desire to embrace humanity so that it might fall on a tuesday this anton antonitch lived on the fourth storey in a house in five corners in four lowpitched rooms one smaller than the other of a particularly frugal and sallow appearance he had two daughters and their aunt who used to pour out the tea of the daughters one was thirteen and another fourteen they both had snub noses and i was awfully shy of them because they were always whispering and giggling together the master of the house usually sat in his study on a leather couch in front of the table with some greyheaded gentleman usually a colleague from our office or some other department i never saw more than two or three visitors there always the same they talked about the excise duty about business in the senate about salaries about promotions about his excellency and the best means of pleasing him and so on i had the patience to sit like a fool beside these people for four hours at a stretch listening to them without knowing what to say to them or venturing to say a word i became stupified several times i felt myself perspiring i was overcome by a sort of paralysis but this was pleasant and good for me on returning home i deferred for a time my desire to embrace all mankind i had however one other acquaintance of a sort simonov who was an old schoolfellow i had a number of schoolfellows indeed in petersburg but i did not associate with them and had even given up nodding to them in the street i believe i had transferred into the department i was in simply to avoid their company and to cut off all connection with my hateful childhood curses on that school and all those terrible years of penal servitude in short i parted from my schoolfellows as soon as i got out into the world there were two or three left to whom i nodded in the street one of them was simonov who had been in no way distinguished at school was of a quiet and equable disposition but i discovered in him a certain independence of character and even honesty i dont even suppose that he was particularly stupid i had at one time spent some rather soulful moments with him but these had not lasted long and had somehow been suddenly clouded over he was evidently uncomfortable at these reminiscences and was i fancy always afraid that i might take up the same tone again i suspected that he had an aversion for me but still i went on going to see him not being quite certain of it and so on one occasion unable to endure my solitude and knowing that as it was thursday anton antonitchs door would be closed i thought of simonov climbing up to his fourth storey i was thinking that the man disliked me and that it was a mistake to go and see him but as it always happened that such reflections impelled me as though purposely to put myself into a false position i went in it was almost a year since i had last seen simonov iii i found two of my old schoolfellows with him they seemed to be discussing an important matter all of them took scarcely any notice of my entrance which was strange for i had not met them for years evidently they looked upon me as something on the level of a common fly i had not been treated like that even at school though they all hated me i knew of course that they must despise me now for my lack of success in the service and for my having let myself sink so low going about badly dressed and so onwhich seemed to them a sign of my incapacity and insignificance but i had not expected such contempt simonov was positively surprised at my turning up even in old days he had always seemed surprised at my coming all this disconcerted me i sat down feeling rather miserable and began listening to what they were saying they were engaged in warm and earnest conversation about a farewell dinner which they wanted to arrange for the next day to a comrade of theirs called zverkov an officer in the army who was going away to a distant province this zverkov had been all the time at school with me too i had begun to hate him particularly in the upper forms in the lower forms he had simply been a pretty playful boy whom everybody liked i had hated him however even in the lower forms just because he was a pretty and playful boy he was always bad at his lessons and got worse and worse as he went on however he left with a good certificate as he had powerful interest during his last year at school he came in for an estate of two hundred serfs and as almost all of us were poor he took up a swaggering tone among us he was vulgar in the extreme but at the same time he was a goodnatured fellow even in his swaggering in spite of superficial fantastic and sham notions of honour and dignity all but very few of us positively grovelled before zverkov and the more so the more he swaggered and it was not from any interested motive that they grovelled but simply because he had been favoured by the gifts of nature moreover it was as it were an accepted idea among us that zverkov was a specialist in regard to tact and the social graces this last fact particularly infuriated me i hated the abrupt selfconfident tone of his voice his admiration of his own witticisms which were often frightfully stupid though he was bold in his language i hated his handsome but stupid face for which i would however have gladly exchanged my intelligent one and the freeandeasy military manners in fashion in the forties i hated the way in which he used to talk of his future conquests of women he did not venture to begin his attack upon women until he had the epaulettes of an officer and was looking forward to them with impatience and boasted of the duels he would constantly be fighting i remember how i invariably so taciturn suddenly fastened upon zverkov when one day talking at a leisure moment with his schoolfellows of his future relations with the fair sex and growing as sportive as a puppy in the sun he all at once declared that he would not leave a single village girl on his estate unnoticed that that was his droit de seigneur and that if the peasants dared to protest he would have them all flogged and double the tax on them the bearded rascals our servile rabble applauded but i attacked him not from compassion for the girls and their fathers but simply because they were applauding such an insect i got the better of him on that occasion but though zverkov was stupid he was lively and impudent and so laughed it off and in such a way that my victory was not really complete the laugh was on his side he got the better of me on several occasions afterwards but without malice jestingly casually i remained angrily and contemptuously silent and would not answer him when we left school he made advances to me i did not rebuff them for i was flattered but we soon parted and quite naturally afterwards i heard of his barrackroom success as a lieutenant and of the fast life he was leading then there came other rumoursof his successes in the service by then he had taken to cutting me in the street and i suspected that he was afraid of compromising himself by greeting a personage as insignificant as me i saw him once in the theatre in the third tier of boxes by then he was wearing shoulderstraps he was twisting and twirling about ingratiating himself with the daughters of an ancient general in three years he had gone off considerably though he was still rather handsome and adroit one could see that by the time he was thirty he would be corpulent so it was to this zverkov that my schoolfellows were going to give a dinner on his departure they had kept up with him for those three years though privately they did not consider themselves on an equal footing with him i am convinced of that of simonovs two visitors one was ferfitchkin a russianized germana little fellow with the face of a monkey a blockhead who was always deriding every one a very bitter enemy of mine from our days in the lower formsa vulgar impudent swaggering fellow who affected a most sensitive feeling of personal honour though of course he was a wretched little coward at heart he was one of those worshippers of zverkov who made up to the latter from interested motives and often borrowed money from him simonovs other visitor trudolyubov was a person in no way remarkablea tall young fellow in the army with a cold face fairly honest though he worshipped success of every sort and was only capable of thinking of promotion he was some sort of distant relation of zverkovs and this foolish as it seems gave him a certain importance among us he always thought me of no consequence whatever his behaviour to me though not quite courteous was tolerable well with seven roubles each said trudolyubov twentyone roubles between the three of us we ought to be able to get a good dinner zverkov of course wont pay of course not since we are inviting him simonov decided can you imagine ferfitchkin interrupted hotly and conceitedly like some insolent flunkey boasting of his master the generals decorations can you imagine that zverkov will let us pay alone he will accept from delicacy but he will order half a dozen bottles of champagne do we want half a dozen for the four of us observed trudolyubov taking notice only of the half dozen so the three of us with zverkov for the fourth twentyone roubles at the htel de paris at five oclock tomorrow simonov who had been asked to make the arrangements concluded finally how twentyone roubles i asked in some agitation with a show of being offended if you count me it will not be twentyone but twentyeight roubles it seemed to me that to invite myself so suddenly and unexpectedly would be positively graceful and that they would all be conquered at once and would look at me with respect do you want to join too simonov observed with no appearance of pleasure seeming to avoid looking at me he knew me through and through it infuriated me that he knew me so thoroughly why not i am an old schoolfellow of his too i believe and i must own i feel hurt that you have left me out i said boiling over again and where were we to find you ferfitchkin put in roughly you never were on good terms with zverkov trudolyubov added frowning but i had already clutched at the idea and would not give it up it seems to me that no one has a right to form an opinion upon that i retorted in a shaking voice as though something tremendous had happened perhaps that is just my reason for wishing it now that i have not always been on good terms with him oh theres no making you out with these refinements trudolyubov jeered well put your name down simonov decided addressing me tomorrow at five oclock at the htel de paris what about the money ferfitchkin began in an undertone indicating me to simonov but he broke off for even simonov was embarrassed that will do said trudolyubov getting up if he wants to come so much let him but its a private thing between us friends ferfitchkin said crossly as he too picked up his hat its not an official gathering we do not want at all perhaps they went away ferfitchkin did not greet me in any way as he went out trudolyubov barely nodded simonov with whom i was left ttette was in a state of vexation and perplexity and looked at me queerly he did not sit down and did not ask me to hm yes tomorrow then will you pay your subscription now i just ask so as to know he muttered in embarrassment i flushed crimson and as i did so i remembered that i had owed simonov fifteen roubles for ageswhich i had indeed never forgotten though i had not paid it you will understand simonov that i could have no idea when i came here i am very much vexed that i have forgotten all right all right that doesnt matter you can pay tomorrow after the dinner i simply wanted to know please dont he broke off and began pacing the room still more vexed as he walked he began to stamp with his heels am i keeping you i asked after two minutes of silence oh he said starting that isto be truthfulyes i have to go and see some one not far from here he added in an apologetic voice somewhat abashed my goodness why didnt you say so i cried seizing my cap with an astonishingly freeandeasy air which was the last thing i should have expected of myself its close by not two paces away simonov repeated accompanying me to the front door with a fussy air which did not suit him at all so five oclock punctually tomorrow he called down the stairs after me he was very glad to get rid of me i was in a fury what possessed me what possessed me to force myself upon them i wondered grinding my teeth as i strode along the street for a scoundrel a pig like that zverkov of course i had better not go of course i must just snap my fingers at them i am not bound in any way ill send simonov a note by tomorrows post but what made me furious was that i knew for certain that i should go that i should make a point of going and the more tactless the more unseemly my going would be the more certainly i would go and there was a positive obstacle to my going i had no money all i had was nine roubles i had to give seven of that to my servant apollon for his monthly wages that was all i paid himhe had to keep himself not to pay him was impossible considering his character but i will talk about that fellow about that plague of mine another time however i knew i should go and should not pay him his wages that night i had the most hideous dreams no wonder all the evening i had been oppressed by memories of my miserable days at school and i could not shake them off i was sent to the school by distant relations upon whom i was dependent and of whom i have heard nothing sincethey sent me there a forlorn silent boy already crushed by their reproaches already troubled by doubt and looking with savage distrust at every one my schoolfellows met me with spiteful and merciless jibes because i was not like any of them but i could not endure their taunts i could not give in to them with the ignoble readiness with which they gave in to one another i hated them from the first and shut myself away from every one in timid wounded and disproportionate pride their coarseness revolted me they laughed cynically at my face at my clumsy figure and yet what stupid faces they had themselves in our school the boys faces seemed in a special way to degenerate and grow stupider how many finelooking boys came to us in a few years they became repulsive even at sixteen i wondered at them morosely even then i was struck by the pettiness of their thoughts the stupidity of their pursuits their games their conversations they had no understanding of such essential things they took no interest in such striking impressive subjects that i could not help considering them inferior to myself it was not wounded vanity that drove me to it and for gods sake do not thrust upon me your hackneyed remarks repeated to nausea that i was only a dreamer while they even then had an understanding of life they understood nothing they had no idea of real life and i swear that that was what made me most indignant with them on the contrary the most obvious striking reality they accepted with fantastic stupidity and even at that time were accustomed to respect success everything that was just but oppressed and looked down upon they laughed at heartlessly and shamefully they took rank for intelligence even at sixteen they were already talking about a snug berth of course a great deal of it was due to their stupidity to the bad examples with which they had always been surrounded in their childhood and boyhood they were monstrously depraved of course a great deal of that too was superficial and an assumption of cynicism of course there were glimpses of youth and freshness even in their depravity but even that freshness was not attractive and showed itself in a certain rakishness i hated them horribly though perhaps i was worse than any of them they repaid me in the same way and did not conceal their aversion for me but by then i did not desire their affection on the contrary i continually longed for their humiliation to escape from their derision i purposely began to make all the progress i could with my studies and forced my way to the very top this impressed them moreover they all began by degrees to grasp that i had already read books none of them could read and understood things not forming part of our school curriculum of which they had not even heard they took a savage and sarcastic view of it but were morally impressed especially as the teachers began to notice me on those grounds the mockery ceased but the hostility remained and cold and strained relations became permanent between us in the end i could not put up with it with years a craving for society for friends developed in me i attempted to get on friendly terms with some of my schoolfellows but somehow or other my intimacy with them was always strained and soon ended of itself once indeed i did have a friend but i was already a tyrant at heart i wanted to exercise unbounded sway over him i tried to instil into him a contempt for his surroundings i required of him a disdainful and complete break with those surroundings i frightened him with my passionate affection i reduced him to tears to hysterics he was a simple and devoted soul but when he devoted himself to me entirely i began to hate him immediately and repulsed himas though all i needed him for was to win a victory over him to subjugate him and nothing else but i could not subjugate all of them my friend was not at all like them either he was in fact a rare exception the first thing i did on leaving school was to give up the special job for which i had been destined so as to break all ties to curse my past and shake the dust from off my feet and goodness knows why after all that i should go trudging off to simonovs early next morning i roused myself and jumped out of bed with excitement as though it were all about to happen at once but i believed that some radical change in my life was coming and would inevitably come that day owing to its rarity perhaps any external event however trivial always made me feel as though some radical change in my life were at hand i went to the office however as usual but sneaked away home two hours earlier to get ready the great thing i thought is not to be the first to arrive or they will think i am overjoyed at coming but there were thousands of such great points to consider and they all agitated and overwhelmed me i polished my boots a second time with my own hands nothing in the world would have induced apollon to clean them twice a day as he considered that it was more than his duties required of him i stole the brushes to clean them from the passage being careful he should not detect it for fear of his contempt then i minutely examined my clothes and thought that everything looked old worn and threadbare i had let myself get too slovenly my uniform perhaps was tidy but i could not go out to dinner in my uniform the worst of it was that on the knee of my trousers was a big yellow stain i had a foreboding that that stain would deprive me of ninetenths of my personal dignity i knew too that it was very poor to think so but this is no time for thinking now i am in for the real thing i thought and my heart sank i knew too perfectly well even then that i was monstrously exaggerating the facts but how could i help it i could not control myself and was already shaking with fever with despair i pictured to myself how coldly and disdainfully that scoundrel zverkov would meet me with what dullwitted invincible contempt the blockhead trudolyubov would look at me with what impudent rudeness the insect ferfitchkin would snigger at me in order to curry favour with zverkov how completely simonov would take it all in and how he would despise me for the abjectness of my vanity and lack of spiritand worst of all how paltry unliterary commonplace it would all be of course the best thing would be not to go at all but that was most impossible of all if i feel impelled to do anything i seem to be pitchforked into it i should have jeered at myself ever afterwards so you funked it you funked it you funked the real thing on the contrary i passionately longed to show all that rabble that i was by no means such a spiritless creature as i seemed to myself what is more even in the acutest paroxysm of this cowardly fever i dreamed of getting the upper hand of dominating them carrying them away making them like meif only for my elevation of thought and unmistakable wit they would abandon zverkov he would sit on one side silent and ashamed while i should crush him then perhaps we would be reconciled and drink to our everlasting friendship but what was most bitter and most humiliating for me was that i knew even then knew fully and for certain that i needed nothing of all this really that i did not really want to crush to subdue to attract them and that i did not care a straw really for the result even if i did achieve it oh how i prayed for the day to pass quickly in unutterable anguish i went to the window opened the movable pane and looked out into the troubled darkness of the thickly falling wet snow at last my wretched little clock hissed out five i seized my hat and trying not to look at apollon who had been all day expecting his months wages but in his foolishness was unwilling to be the first to speak about it i slipt between him and the door and jumping into a highclass sledge on which i spent my last half rouble i drove up in grand style to the htel de paris iv i had been certain the day before that i should be the first to arrive but it was not a question of being the first to arrive not only were they not there but i had difficulty in finding our room the table was not laid even what did it mean after a good many questions i elicited from the waiters that the dinner had been ordered not for five but for six oclock this was confirmed at the buffet too i felt really ashamed to go on questioning them it was only twentyfive minutes past five if they changed the dinner hour they ought at least to have let me knowthat is what the post is for and not to have put me in an absurd position in my own eyes and and even before the waiters i sat down the servant began laying the table i felt even more humiliated when he was present towards six oclock they brought in candles though there were lamps burning in the room it had not occurred to the waiter however to bring them in at once when i arrived in the next room two gloomy angrylooking persons were eating their dinners in silence at two different tables there was a great deal of noise even shouting in a room further away one could hear the laughter of a crowd of people and nasty little shrieks in french there were ladies at the dinner it was sickening in fact i rarely passed more unpleasant moments so much so that when they did arrive all together punctually at six i was overjoyed to see them as though they were my deliverers and even forgot that it was incumbent upon me to show resentment zverkov walked in at the head of them evidently he was the leading spirit he and all of them were laughing but seeing me zverkov drew himself up a little walked up to me deliberately with a slight rather jaunty bend from the waist he shook hands with me in a friendly but not overfriendly fashion with a sort of circumspect courtesy like that of a general as though in giving me his hand he were warding off something i had imagined on the contrary that on coming in he would at once break into his habitual thin shrill laugh and fall to making his insipid jokes and witticisms i had been preparing for them ever since the previous day but i had not expected such condescension such highofficial courtesy so then he felt himself ineffably superior to me in every respect if he only meant to insult me by that highofficial tone it would not matter i thoughti could pay him back for it one way or another but what if in reality without the least desire to be offensive that sheepshead had a notion in earnest that he was superior to me and could only look at me in a patronizing way the very supposition made me gasp i was surprised to hear of your desire to join us he began lisping and drawling which was something new you and i seem to have seen nothing of one another you fight shy of us you shouldnt we are not such terrible people as you think well anyway i am glad to renew our acquaintance and he turned carelessly to put down his hat on the window have you been waiting long trudolyubov inquired i arrived at five oclock as you told me yesterday i answered aloud with an irritability that threatened an explosion didnt you let him know that we had changed the hour said trudolyubov to simonov no i didnt i forgot the latter replied with no sign of regret and without even apologizing to me he went off to order the hors doeuvres so youve been here a whole hour oh poor fellow zverkov cried ironically for to his notions this was bound to be extremely funny that rascal ferfitchkin followed with his nasty little snigger like a puppy yapping my position struck him too as exquisitely ludicrous and embarrassing it isnt funny at all i cried to ferfitchkin more and more irritated it wasnt my fault but other peoples they neglected to let me know it was it was it was simply absurd its not only absurd but something else as well muttered trudolyubov navely taking my part you are not hard enough upon it it was simply rudenessunintentional of course and how could simonov hm if a trick like that had been played on me observed ferfitchkin i should but you should have ordered something for yourself zverkov interrupted or simply asked for dinner without waiting for us you will allow that i might have done that without your permission i rapped out if i waited it was let us sit down gentlemen cried simonov coming in everything is ready i can answer for the champagne it is capitally frozen you see i did not know your address where was i to look for you he suddenly turned to me but again he seemed to avoid looking at me evidently he had something against me it must have been what happened yesterday all sat down i did the same it was a round table trudolyubov was on my left simonov on my right zverkov was sitting opposite ferfitchkin next to him between him and trudolyubov tell me are you in a government office zverkov went on attending to me seeing that i was embarrassed he seriously thought that he ought to be friendly to me and so to speak cheer me up does he want me to throw a bottle at his head i thought in a fury in my novel surroundings i was unnaturally ready to be irritated in the n office i answered jerkily with my eyes on my plate and haave you a good berth i say what maade you leave your original job what maade me was that i wanted to leave my original job i drawled more than he hardly able to control myself ferfitchkin went off into a guffaw simonov looked at me ironically trudolyubov left off eating and began looking at me with curiosity zverkov winced but he tried not to notice it and the remuneration what remuneration i mean your saalary why are you crossexamining me however i told him at once what my salary was i turned horribly red it is not very handsome zverkov observed majestically yes you cant afford to dine at cafs on that ferfitchkin added insolently to my thinking its very poor trudolyubov observed gravely and how thin you have grown how you have changed added zverkov with a shade of venom in his voice scanning me and my attire with a sort of insolent compassion oh spare his blushes cried ferfitchkin sniggering my dear sir allow me to tell you i am not blushing i broke out at last do you hear i am dining here at this caf at my own expense not at other peoplesnote that mr ferfitchkin whaat isnt every one here dining at his own expense you would seem to be ferfitchkin flew out at me turning as red as a lobster and looking me in the face with fury thaat i answered feeling i had gone too far and i imagine it would be better to talk of something more intelligent you intend to show off your intelligence i suppose dont disturb yourself that would be quite out of place here why are you clacking away like that my good sir eh have you gone out of your wits in your office enough gentlemen enough zverkov cried authoritatively how stupid it is muttered simonov it really is stupid we have met here a company of friends for a farewell dinner to a comrade and you carry on an altercation said trudolyubov rudely addressing himself to me alone you invited yourself to join us so dont disturb the general harmony enough enough cried zverkov give over gentlemen its out of place better let me tell you how i nearly got married the day before yesterday and then followed a burlesque narrative of how this gentleman had almost been married two days before there was not a word about the marriage however but the story was adorned with generals colonels and kammerjunkers while zverkov almost took the lead among them it was greeted with approving laughter ferfitchkin positively squealed no one paid any attention to me and i sat crushed and humiliated good heavens these are not the people for me i thought and what a fool i have made of myself before them i let ferfitchkin go too far though the brutes imagine they are doing me an honour in letting me sit down with them they dont understand that its an honour to them and not to me ive grown thinner my clothes oh damn my trousers zverkov noticed the yellow stain on the knee as soon as he came in but whats the use i must get up at once this very minute take my hat and simply go without a word with contempt and tomorrow i can send a challenge the scoundrels as though i cared about the seven roubles they may think damn it i dont care about the seven roubles ill go this minute of course i remained i drank sherry and lafitte by the glassful in my discomfiture being unaccustomed to it i was quickly affected my annoyance increased as the wine went to my head i longed all at once to insult them all in a most flagrant manner and then go away to seize the moment and show what i could do so that they would say hes clever though he is absurd and and in fact damn them all i scanned them all insolently with my drowsy eyes but they seemed to have forgotten me altogether they were noisy vociferous cheerful zverkov was talking all the time i began listening zverkov was talking of some exuberant lady whom he had at last led on to declaring her love of course he was lying like a horse and how he had been helped in this affair by an intimate friend of his a prince kolya an officer in the hussars who had three thousand serfs and yet this kolya who has three thousand serfs has not put in an appearance here tonight to see you off i cut in suddenly for a minute every one was silent you are drunk already trudolyubov deigned to notice me at last glancing contemptuously in my direction zverkov without a word examined me as though i were an insect i dropped my eyes simonov made haste to fill up the glasses with champagne trudolyubov raised his glass as did every one else but me your health and good luck on the journey he cried to zverkov to old times to our future hurrah they all tossed off their glasses and crowded round zverkov to kiss him i did not move my full glass stood untouched before me why arent you going to drink it roared trudolyubov losing patience and turning menacingly to me i want to make a speech separately on my own account and then ill drink it mr trudolyubov spiteful brute muttered simonov i drew myself up in my chair and feverishly seized my glass prepared for something extraordinary though i did not know myself precisely what i was going to say silence cried ferfitchkin now for a display of wit zverkov waited very gravely knowing what was coming mr lieutenant zverkov i began let me tell you that i hate phrases phrasemongers and men in corsets thats the first point and there is a second one to follow it there was a general stir the second point is i hate ribaldry and ribald talkers especially ribald talkers the third point i love justice truth and honesty i went on almost mechanically for i was beginning to shiver with horror myself and had no idea how i came to be talking like this i love thought monsieur zverkov i love true comradeship on an equal footing and not hm i love but however why not i will drink your health too mr zverkov seduce the circassian girls shoot the enemies of the fatherland and and to your health monsieur zverkov zverkov got up from his seat bowed to me and said i am very much obliged to you he was frightfully offended and turned pale damn the fellow roared trudolyubov bringing his fist down on the table well he wants a punch in the face for that squealed ferfitchkin we ought to turn him out muttered simonov not a word gentlemen not a movement cried zverkov solemnly checking the general indignation i thank you all but i can show him for myself how much value i attach to his words mr ferfitchkin you will give me satisfaction tomorrow for your words just now i said aloud turning with dignity to ferfitchkin a duel you mean certainly he answered but probably i was so ridiculous as i challenged him and it was so out of keeping with my appearance that everyone including ferfitchkin was prostrate with laughter yes let him alone of course he is quite drunk trudolyubov said with disgust i shall never forgive myself for letting him join us simonov muttered again now is the time to throw a bottle at their heads i thought to myself i picked up the bottle and filled my glass no id better sit on to the end i went on thinking you would be pleased my friends if i went away nothing will induce me to go ill go on sitting here and drinking to the end on purpose as a sign that i dont think you of the slightest consequence i will go on sitting and drinking because this is a publichouse and i paid my entrance money ill sit here and drink for i look upon you as so many pawns as inanimate pawns ill sit here and drink and sing if i want to yes sing for i have the right to to sing hm but i did not sing i simply tried not to look at any of them i assumed most unconcerned attitudes and waited with impatience for them to speak first but alas they did not address me and oh how i wished how i wished at that moment to be reconciled to them it struck eight at last nine they moved from the table to the sofa zverkov stretched himself on a lounge and put one foot on a round table wine was brought there he did as a fact order three bottles on his own account i of course was not invited to join them they all sat round him on the sofa they listened to him almost with reverence it was evident that they were fond of him what for what for i wondered from time to time they were moved to drunken enthusiasm and kissed each other they talked of the caucasus of the nature of true passion of snug berths in the service of the income of an hussar called podharzhevsky whom none of them knew personally and rejoiced in the largeness of it of the extraordinary grace and beauty of a princess d whom none of them had ever seen then it came to shakespeares being immortal i smiled contemptuously and walked up and down the other side of the room opposite the sofa from the table to the stove and back again i tried my very utmost to show them that i could do without them and yet i purposely made a noise with my boots thumping with my heels but it was all in vain they paid no attention i had the patience to walk up and down in front of them from eight oclock till eleven in the same place from the table to the stove and back again i walk up and down to please myself and no one can prevent me the waiter who came into the room stopped from time to time to look at me i was somewhat giddy from turning round so often at moments it seemed to me that i was in delirium during those three hours i was three times soaked with sweat and dry again at times with an intense acute pang i was stabbed to the heart by the thought that ten years twenty years forty years would pass and that even in forty years i would remember with loathing and humiliation those filthiest most ludicrous and most awful moments of my life no one could have gone out of his way to degrade himself more shamelessly and i fully realized it fully and yet i went on pacing up and down from the table to the stove oh if you only knew what thoughts and feelings i am capable of how cultured i am i thought at moments mentally addressing the sofa on which my enemies were sitting but my enemies behaved as though i were not in the room onceonly oncethey turned towards me just when zverkov was talking about shakespeare and i suddenly gave a contemptuous laugh i laughed in such an affected and disgusting way that they all at once broke off their conversation and silently and gravely for two minutes watched me walking up and down from the table to the stove taking no notice of them but nothing came of it they said nothing and two minutes later they ceased to notice me again it struck eleven friends cried zverkov getting up from the sofa let us all be off now there of course of course the others assented i turned sharply to zverkov i was so harassed so exhausted that i would have cut my throat to put an end to it i was in a fever my hair soaked with perspiration stuck to my forehead and temples zverkov i beg your pardon i said abruptly and resolutely ferfitchkin yours too and every ones every ones i have insulted you all aha a duel is not in your line old man ferfitchkin hissed venomously it sent a sharp pang to my heart no its not the duel i am afraid of ferfitchkin i am ready to fight you tomorrow after we are reconciled i insist upon it in fact and you cannot refuse i want to show you that i am not afraid of a duel you shall fire first and i shall fire into the air he is comforting himself said simonov hes simply raving said trudolyubov but let us pass why are you barring our way what do you want zverkov answered disdainfully they were all flushed their eyes were bright they had been drinking heavily i ask for your friendship zverkov i insulted you but insulted you insulted me understand sir that you never under any circumstances could possibly insult me and thats enough for you out of the way concluded trudolyubov olympia is mine friends thats agreed cried zverkov we wont dispute your right we wont dispute your right the others answered laughing i stood as though spat upon the party went noisily out of the room trudolyubov struck up some stupid song simonov remained behind for a moment to tip the waiters i suddenly went up to him simonov give me six roubles i said with desperate resolution he looked at me in extreme amazement with vacant eyes he too was drunk you dont mean you are coming with us yes ive no money he snapped out and with a scornful laugh he went out of the room i clutched at his overcoat it was a nightmare simonov i saw you had money why do you refuse me am i a scoundrel beware of refusing me if you knew if you knew why i am asking my whole future my whole plans depend upon it simonov pulled out the money and almost flung it at me take it if you have no sense of shame he pronounced pitilessly and ran to overtake them i was left for a moment alone disorder the remains of dinner a broken wineglass on the floor spilt wine cigarette ends fumes of drink and delirium in my brain an agonizing misery in my heart and finally the waiter who had seen and heard all and was looking inquisitively into my face i am going there i cried either they shall all go down on their knees to beg for my friendship or i will give zverkov a slap in the face v so this is it this is it at lastcontact with real life i muttered as i ran headlong downstairs this is very different from the popes leaving rome and going to brazil very different from the ball on lake como you are a scoundrel a thought flashed through my mind if you laugh at this now no matter i cried answering myself now everything is lost there was no trace to be seen of them but that made no differencei knew where they had gone at the steps was standing a solitary night sledgedriver in a rough peasant coat powdered over with the still falling wet and as it were warm snow it was hot and steamy the little shaggy piebald horse was also covered with snow and coughing i remember that very well i made a rush for the roughly made sledge but as soon as i raised my foot to get into it the recollection of how simonov had just given me six roubles seemed to double me up and i tumbled into the sledge like a sack no i must do a great deal to make up for all that i cried but i will make up for it or perish on the spot this very night start we set off there was a perfect whirl in my head they wont go down on their knees to beg for my friendship that is a mirage cheap mirage revolting romantic and fantasticalthats another ball on lake como and so i am bound to slap zverkovs face it is my duty to and so it is settled i am flying to give him a slap in the face hurry up the driver tugged at the reins as soon as i go in ill give it him ought i before giving him the slap to say a few words by way of preface no ill simply go in and give it him they will all be sitting in the drawingroom and he with olympia on the sofa that damned olympia she laughed at my looks on one occasion and refused me ill pull olympias hair pull zverkovs ears no better one ear and pull him by it round the room maybe they will all begin beating me and will kick me out thats most likely indeed no matter anyway i shall first slap him the initiative will be mine and by the laws of honour that is everything he will be branded and cannot wipe off the slap by any blows by nothing but a duel he will be forced to fight and let them beat me now let them the ungrateful wretches trudolyubov will beat me hardest he is so strong ferfitchkin will be sure to catch hold sideways and tug at my hair but no matter no matter thats what i am going for the blockheads will be forced at last to see the tragedy of it all when they drag me to the door i shall call out to them that in reality they are not worth my little finger get on driver get on i cried to the driver he started and flicked his whip i shouted so savagely we shall fight at daybreak thats a settled thing ive done with the office ferfitchkin made a joke about it just now but where can i get pistols nonsense ill get my salary in advance and buy them and powder and bullets thats the seconds business and how can it all be done by daybreak and where am i to get a second i have no friends nonsense i cried lashing myself up more and more its of no consequence the first person i meet in the street is bound to be my second just as he would be bound to pull a drowning man out of water the most eccentric things may happen even if i were to ask the director himself to be my second tomorrow he would be bound to consent if only from a feeling of chivalry and to keep the secret anton antonitch the fact is that at that very minute the disgusting absurdity of my plan and the other side of the question was clearer and more vivid to my imagination than it could be to any one on earth but get on driver get on you rascal get on ugh sir said the son of toil cold shivers suddenly ran down me wouldnt it be better to go straight home my god my god why did i invite myself to this dinner yesterday but no its impossible and my walking up and down for three hours from the table to the stove no they they and no one else must pay for my walking up and down they must wipe out this dishonour drive on and what if they give me into custody they wont dare theyll be afraid of the scandal and what if zverkov is so contemptuous that he refuses to fight a duel he is sure to but in that case ill show them i will turn up at the posting station when he is setting off tomorrow ill catch him by the leg ill pull off his coat when he gets into the carriage ill get my teeth into his hand ill bite him see what lengths you can drive a desperate man to he may hit me on the head and they may belabour me from behind i will shout to the assembled multitude look at this young puppy who is driving off to captivate the circassian girls after letting me spit in his face of course after that everything will be over the office will have vanished off the face of the earth i shall be arrested i shall be tried i shall be dismissed from the service thrown in prison sent to siberia never mind in fifteen years when they let me out of prison i will trudge off to him a beggar in rags i shall find him in some provincial town he will be married and happy he will have a grownup daughter i shall say to him look monster at my hollow cheeks and my rags ive lost everythingmy career my happiness art science the woman i loved and all through you here are pistols i have come to discharge my pistol and and i forgive you then i shall fire into the air and he will hear nothing more of me i was actually on the point of tears though i knew perfectly well at that moment that all this was out of pushkins silvio and lermontovs masquerade and all at once i felt horribly ashamed so ashamed that i stopped the horse got out of the sledge and stood still in the snow in the middle of the street the driver gazed at me sighing and astonished what was i to do i could not go on thereit was evidently stupid and i could not leave things as they were because that would seem as though heavens how could i leave things and after such insults no i cried throwing myself into the sledge again it is ordained it is fate drive on drive on and in my impatience i punched the sledgedriver on the back of the neck what are you up to what are you hitting me for the peasant shouted but he whipped up his nag so that it began kicking the wet snow was falling in big flakes i unbuttoned myself regardless of it i forgot everything else for i had finally decided on the slap and felt with horror that it was going to happen now at once and that no force could stop it the deserted street lamps gleamed sullenly in the snowy darkness like torches at a funeral the snow drifted under my greatcoat under my coat under my cravat and melted there i did not wrap myself upall was lost anyway at last we arrived i jumped out almost unconscious ran up the steps and began knocking and kicking at the door i felt fearfully weak particularly in my legs and my knees the door was opened quickly as though they knew i was coming as a fact simonov had warned them that perhaps another gentleman would arrive and this was a place in which one had to give notice and to observe certain precautions it was one of those millinery establishments which were abolished by the police a good time ago by day it really was a shop but at night if one had an introduction one might visit it for other purposes i walked rapidly through the dark shop into the familiar drawingroom where there was only one candle burning and stood still in amazement there was no one there where are they i asked somebody but by now of course they had separated before me was standing a person with a stupid smile the madam herself who had seen me before a minute later a door opened and another person came in taking no notice of anything i strode about the room and i believe i talked to myself i felt as though i had been saved from death and was conscious of this joyfully all over i should have given that slap i should certainly certainly have given it but now they were not here and everything had vanished and changed i looked round i could not realize my condition yet i looked mechanically at the girl who had come in and had a glimpse of a fresh young rather pale face with straight dark eyebrows and with grave as it were wondering eyes that attracted me at once i should have hated her if she had been smiling i began looking at her more intently and as it were with effort i had not fully collected my thoughts there was something simple and goodnatured in her face but something strangely grave i am sure that this stood in her way here and no one of those fools had noticed her she could not however have been called a beauty though she was tall stronglooking and well built she was very simply dressed something loathsome stirred within me i went straight up to her i chanced to look into the glass my harassed face struck me as revolting in the extreme pale angry abject with dishevelled hair no matter i am glad of it i thought i am glad that i shall seem repulsive to her i like that vi somewhere behind a screen a clock began wheezing as though oppressed by something as though some one were strangling it after an unnaturally prolonged wheezing there followed a shrill nasty and as it were unexpectedly rapid chimeas though some one were suddenly jumping forward it struck two i woke up though i had indeed not been asleep but lying half conscious it was almost completely dark in the narrow cramped lowpitched room cumbered up with an enormous wardrobe and piles of cardboard boxes and all sorts of frippery and litter the candle end that had been burning on the table was going out and gave a faint flicker from time to time in a few minutes there would be complete darkness i was not long in coming to myself everything came back to my mind at once without an effort as though it had been in ambush to pounce upon me again and indeed even while i was unconscious a point seemed continually to remain in my memory unforgotten and round it my dreams moved drearily but strange to say everything that had happened to me in that day seemed to me now on waking to be in the far far away past as though i had long long ago lived all that down my head was full of fumes something seemed to be hovering over me rousing me exciting me and making me restless misery and spite seemed surging up in me again and seeking an outlet suddenly i saw beside me two wide open eyes scrutinizing me curiously and persistently the look in those eyes was coldly detached sullen as it were utterly remote it weighed upon me a grim idea came into my brain and passed all over my body as a horrible sensation such as one feels when one goes into a damp and mouldy cellar there was something unnatural in those two eyes beginning to look at me only now i recalled too that during those two hours i had not said a single word to this creature and had in fact considered it utterly superfluous in fact the silence had for some reason gratified me now i suddenly realized vividly the hideous idearevolting as a spiderof vice which without love grossly and shamelessly begins with that in which true love finds its consummation for a long time we gazed at each other like that but she did not drop her eyes before mine and her expression did not change so that at last i felt uncomfortable what is your name i asked abruptly to put an end to it liza she answered almost in a whisper but somehow far from graciously and she turned her eyes away i was silent what weather the snow its disgusting i said almost to myself putting my arm under my head despondently and gazing at the ceiling she made no answer this was horrible have you always lived in petersburg i asked a minute later almost angrily turning my head slightly towards her no where do you come from from riga she answered reluctantly are you a german no russian have you been here long where in this house a fortnight she spoke more and more jerkily the candle went out i could no longer distinguish her face have you a father and mother yes no i have where are they there in riga what are they oh nothing nothing why what class are they tradespeople have you always lived with them yes how old are you twenty why did you leave them oh for no reason that answer meant let me alone i feel sick sad we were silent god knows why i did not go away i felt myself more and more sick and dreary the images of the previous day began of themselves apart from my will flitting through my memory in confusion i suddenly recalled something i had seen that morning when full of anxious thoughts i was hurrying to the office i saw them carrying a coffin out yesterday and they nearly dropped it i suddenly said aloud not that i desired to open the conversation but as it were by accident a coffin yes in the haymarket they were bringing it up out of a cellar from a cellar not from a cellar but from a basement oh you know down below from a house of illfame it was filthy all round eggshells litter a stench it was loathsome silence a nasty day to be buried i began simply to avoid being silent nasty in what way the snow the wet i yawned it makes no difference she said suddenly after a brief silence no its horrid i yawned again the gravediggers must have sworn at getting drenched by the snow and there must have been water in the grave why water in the grave she asked with a sort of curiosity but speaking even more harshly and abruptly than before i suddenly began to feel provoked why there must have been water at the bottom a foot deep you cant dig a dry grave in volkovo cemetery why why why the place is waterlogged its a regular marsh so they bury them in water ive seen it myself many times i had never seen it once indeed i had never been in volkovo and had only heard stories of it do you mean to say you dont mind how you die but why should i die she answered as though defending herself why some day you will die and you will die just the same as that dead woman she was a girl like you she died of consumption a wench would have died in hospital she knows all about it already she said wench not girl she was in debt to her madam i retorted more and more provoked by the discussion and went on earning money for her up to the end though she was in consumption some sledgedrivers standing by were talking about her to some soldiers and telling them so no doubt they knew her they were laughing they were going to meet in a pothouse to drink to her memory a great deal of this was my invention silence followed profound silence she did not stir and is it better to die in a hospital isnt it just the same besides why should i die she added irritably if not now a little later why a little later why indeed now you are young pretty fresh you fetch a high price but after another year of this life you will be very differentyou will go off in a year anyway in a year you will be worth less i continued malignantly you will go from here to something lower another house a year laterto a third lower and lower and in seven years you will come to a basement in the haymarket that will be if you were lucky but it would be much worse if you got some disease consumption say and caught a chill or something or other its not easy to get over an illness in your way of life if you catch anything you may not get rid of it and so you would die oh well then i shall die she answered quite vindictively and she made a quick movement but one is sorry sorry for whom sorry for life silence have you been engaged to be married eh whats that to you oh i am not crossexamining you its nothing to me why are you so cross of course you may have had your own troubles what is it to me its simply that i felt sorry sorry for whom sorry for you no need she whispered hardly audibly and again made a faint movement that incensed me at once what i was so gentle with her and she why do you think that you are on the right path i dont think anything thats whats wrong that you dont think realize it while there is still time there still is time you are still young goodlooking you might love be married be happy not all married women are happy she snapped out in the rude abrupt tone she had used at first not all of course but anyway it is much better than the life here infinitely better besides with love one can live even without happiness even in sorrow life is sweet life is sweet however one lives but here what is there but foulness phew i turned away with disgust i was no longer reasoning coldly i began to feel myself what i was saying and warmed to the subject i was already longing to expound the cherished ideas i had brooded over in my corner something suddenly flared up in me an object had appeared before me never mind my being here i am not an example for you i am perhaps worse than you are i was drunk when i came here though i hastened however to say in selfdefence besides a man is no example for a woman its a different thing i may degrade and defile myself but i am not any ones slave i come and go and thats an end of it i shake it off and i am a different man but you are a slave from the start yes a slave you give up everything your whole freedom if you want to break your chains afterwards you wont be able to you will be more and more fast in the snares it is an accursed bondage i know it i wont speak of anything else maybe you wont understand but tell me no doubt you are in debt to your madam there you see i added though she made no answer but only listened in silence entirely absorbed thats a bondage for you you will never buy your freedom they will see to that its like selling your soul to the devil and besides perhaps i too am just as unluckyhow do you knowand wallow in the mud on purpose out of misery you know men take to drink from grief well maybe i am here from grief come tell me what is there good here here you and i came together just now and did not say one word to one another all the time and it was only afterwards you began staring at me like a wild creature and i at you is that loving is that how one human being should meet another its hideous thats what it is yes she assented sharply and hurriedly i was positively astounded by the promptitude of this yes so the same thought may have been straying through her mind when she was staring at me just before so she too was capable of certain thoughts damn it all this was interesting this was a point of likeness i thought almost rubbing my hands and indeed its easy to turn a young soul like that it was the exercise of my power that attracted me most she turned her head nearer to me and it seemed to me in the darkness that she propped herself on her arm perhaps she was scrutinizing me how i regretted that i could not see her eyes i heard her deep breathing why have you come here i asked her with a note of authority already in my voice oh i dont know but how nice it would be to be living in your fathers house its warm and free you have a home of your own but what if its worse than this i must take the right tone flashed through my mind i may not get far with sentimentality but it was only a momentary thought i swear she really did interest me besides i was exhausted and moody and cunning so easily goes handinhand with feeling who denies it i hastened to answer anything may happen i am convinced that some one has wronged you and that you are more sinned against than sinning of course i know nothing of your story but its not likely a girl like you has come here of her own inclination a girl like me she whispered hardly audibly but i heard it damn it all i was flattering her that was horrid but perhaps it was a good thing she was silent see liza i will tell you about myself if i had had a home from childhood i shouldnt be what i am now i often think that however bad it may be at home anyway they are your father and mother and not enemies strangers once a year at least theyll show their love of you anyway you know you are at home i grew up without a home and perhaps thats why ive turned so unfeeling i waited again perhaps she doesnt understand i thought and indeed it is absurdits moralizing if i were a father and had a daughter i believe i should love my daughter more than my sons really i began indirectly as though talking of something else to distract her attention i must confess i blushed why so she asked ah so she was listening i dont know liza i knew a father who was a stern austere man but used to go down on his knees to his daughter used to kiss her hands her feet he couldnt make enough of her really when she danced at parties he used to stand for five hours at a stretch gazing at her he was mad over her i understand that she would fall asleep tired at night and he would wake to kiss her in her sleep and make the sign of the cross over her he would go about in a dirty old coat he was stingy to every one else but would spend his last penny for her giving her expensive presents and it was his greatest delight when she was pleased with what he gave her fathers always love their daughters more than the mothers do some girls live happily at home and i believe i should never let my daughters marry what next she said with a faint smile i should be jealous i really should to think that she should kiss any one else that she should love a stranger more than her father its painful to imagine it of course thats all nonsense of course every father would be reasonable at last but i believe before i should let her marry i should worry myself to death i should find fault with all her suitors but i should end by letting her marry whom she herself loved the one whom the daughter loves always seems the worst to the father you know that is always so so many family troubles come from that some are glad to sell their daughters rather than marrying them honourably ah so that was it such a thing liza happens in those accursed families in which there is neither love nor god i retorted warmly and where there is no love there is no sense either there are such families its true but i am not speaking of them you must have seen wickedness in your own family if you talk like that truly you must have been unlucky hm that sort of thing mostly comes about through poverty and is it any better with the gentry even among the poor honest people live happily hm yes perhaps another thing liza man is fond of reckoning up his troubles but does not count his joys if he counted them up as he ought he would see that every lot has enough happiness provided for it and what if all goes well with the family if the blessing of god is upon it if the husband is a good one loves you cherishes you never leaves you there is happiness in such a family even sometimes there is happiness in the midst of sorrow and indeed sorrow is everywhere if you marry you will find out for yourself but think of the first years of married life with one you love what happiness what happiness there sometimes is in it and indeed its the ordinary thing in those early days even quarrels with ones husband end happily some women get up quarrels with their husbands just because they love them indeed i knew a woman like that she seemed to say that because she loved him she would torment him and make him feel it you know that you may torment a man on purpose through love women are particularly given to that thinking to themselves i will love him so i will make so much of him afterwards that its no sin to torment him a little now and all in the house rejoice in the sight of you and you are happy and gay and peaceful and honourable then there are some women who are jealous if he went off anywherei knew one such woman she couldnt restrain herself but would jump up at night and run off on the sly to find out where he was whether he was with some other woman thats a pity and the woman knows herself its wrong and her heart fails her and she suffers but she lovesits all through love and how sweet it is to make it up after quarrels to own herself in the wrong or to forgive him and they are both so happy all at onceas though they had met anew been married over again as though their love had begun afresh and no one no one should know what passes between husband and wife if they love one another and whatever quarrels there may be between them they ought not to call in their own mother to judge between them and tell tales of one another they are their own judges love is a holy mystery and ought to be hidden from all other eyes whatever happens that makes it holier and better they respect one another more and much is built on respect and if once there has been love if they have been married for love why should love pass away surely one can keep it it is rare that one cannot keep it and if the husband is kind and straightforward why should not love last the first phase of married love will pass it is true but then there will come a love that is better still then there will be the union of souls they will have everything in common there will be no secrets between them and once they have children the most difficult times will seem to them happy so long as there is love and courage even toil will be a joy you may deny yourself bread for your children and even that will be a joy they will love you for it afterwards so you are laying by for your future as the children grow up you feel that you are an example a support for them that even after you die your children will always keep your thoughts and feelings because they have received them from you they will take on your semblance and likeness so you see this is a great duty how can it fail to draw the father and mother nearer people say its a trial to have children who says that it is heavenly happiness are you fond of little children liza i am awfully fond of them you knowa little rosy baby boy at your bosom and what husbands heart is not touched seeing his wife nursing his child a plump little rosy baby sprawling and snuggling chubby little hands and feet clean tiny little nails so tiny that it makes one laugh to look at them eyes that look as if they understand everything and while it sucks it clutches at your bosom with its little hand plays when its father comes up the child tears itself away from the bosom flings itself back looks at its father laughs as though it were fearfully funny and falls to sucking again or it will bite its mothers breast when its little teeth are coming while it looks sideways at her with its little eyes as though to say look i am biting is not all that happiness when they are the three together husband wife and child one can forgive a great deal for the sake of such moments yes liza one must first learn to live oneself before one blames others its by pictures pictures like that one must get at you i thought to myself though i did speak with real feeling and all at once i flushed crimson what if she were suddenly to burst out laughing what should i do then that idea drove me to fury towards the end of my speech i really was excited and now my vanity was somehow wounded the silence continued i almost nudged her why are you she began and stopped but i understood there was a quiver of something different in her voice not abrupt harsh and unyielding as before but something soft and shamefaced so shamefaced that i suddenly felt ashamed and guilty what i asked with tender curiosity why you what why you speak somehow like a book she said and again there was a note of irony in her voice that remark sent a pang to my heart it was not what i was expecting i did not understand that she was hiding her feelings under irony that this is usually the last refuge of modest and chastesouled people when the privacy of their soul is coarsely and intrusively invaded and that their pride makes them refuse to surrender till the last moment and shrink from giving expression to their feelings before you i ought to have guessed the truth from the timidity with which she had repeatedly approached her sarcasm only bringing herself to utter it at last with an effort but i did not guess and an evil feeling took possession of me wait a bit i thought vii oh hush liza how can you talk about being like a book when it makes even me an outsider feel sick though i dont look at it as an outsider for indeed it touches me to the heart is it possible is it possible that you do not feel sick at being here yourself evidently habit does wonders god knows what habit can do with any one can you seriously think that you will never grow old that you will always be goodlooking and that they will keep you here for ever and ever i say nothing of the loathsomeness of the life here though let me tell you this about itabout your present life i mean here though you are young now attractive nice with soul and feeling yet you know as soon as i came to myself just now i felt at once sick at being here with you one can only come here when one is drunk but if you were anywhere else living as good people live i should perhaps be more than attracted by you should fall in love with you should be glad of a look from you let alone a word i should hang about your door should go down on my knees to you should look upon you as my betrothed and think it an honour to be allowed to i should not dare to have an impure thought about you but here you see i know that i have only to whistle and you have to come with me whether you like it or not i dont consult your wishes but you mine the lowest labourer hires himself as a workman but he doesnt make a slave of himself altogether besides he knows that he will be free again presently but when are you free only think what you are giving up here what is it you are making a slave of it is your soul together with your body you are selling your soul which you have no right to dispose of you give your love to be outraged by every drunkard love but thats everything you know its a priceless diamond its a maidens treasure lovewhy a man would be ready to give his soul to face death to gain that love but how much is your love worth now you are sold all of you body and soul and there is no need to strive for love when you can have everything without love and you know there is no greater insult to a girl than that do you understand to be sure i have heard that they comfort you poor fools they let you have lovers of your own here but you know thats simply a farce thats simply a sham its just laughing at you and you are taken in by it why do you suppose he really loves you that lover of yours i dont believe it how can he love you when he knows you may be called away from him any minute he would be a low fellow if he did will he have a grain of respect for you what have you in common with him he laughs at you and robs youthat is all his love amounts to you are lucky if he does not beat you very likely he does beat you too ask him if you have got one whether he will marry you he will laugh in your face if he doesnt spit in it or give you a blowthough maybe he is not worth a bad halfpenny himself and for what have you ruined your life if you come to think of it for the coffee they give you to drink and the plentiful meals but with what object are they feeding you up an honest girl couldnt swallow the food for she would know what she was being fed for you are in debt here and of course you will always be in debt and you will go on in debt to the end till the visitors here begin to scorn you and that will soon happen dont rely upon your youthall that flies by express train here you know you will be kicked out and not simply kicked out long before that shell begin nagging at you scolding you abusing you as though you had not sacrificed your health for her had not thrown away your youth and your soul for her benefit but as though you had ruined her beggared her robbed her and dont expect any one to take your part the others your companions will attack you too to win her favour for all are in slavery here and have lost all conscience and pity here long ago they have become utterly vile and nothing on earth is viler more loathsome and more insulting than their abuse and you are laying down everything here unconditionally youth and health and beauty and hope and at twentytwo you will look like a woman of fiveandthirty and you will be lucky if you are not diseased pray to god for that no doubt you are thinking now that you have a gay time and no work to do yet there is no work harder or more dreadful in the world or ever has been one would think that the heart alone would be worn out with tears and you wont dare to say a word not half a word when they drive you away from here you will go away as though you were to blame you will change to another house then to a third then somewhere else till you come down at last to the haymarket there you will be beaten at every turn that is good manners there the visitors dont know how to be friendly without beating you you dont believe that it is so hateful there go and look for yourself some time you can see with your own eyes once one new years day i saw a woman at a door they had turned her out as a joke to give her a taste of the frost because she had been crying so much and they shut the door behind her at nine oclock in the morning she was already quite drunk dishevelled halfnaked covered with bruises her face was powdered but she had a black eye blood was trickling from her nose and her teeth some cabman had just given her a drubbing she was sitting on the stone steps a salt fish of some sort was in her hand she was crying wailing something about her luck and beating with the fish on the steps and cabmen and drunken soldiers were crowding in the doorway taunting her you dont believe that you will ever be like that i should be sorry to believe it too but how do you know maybe ten years eight years ago that very woman with the salt fish came here fresh as a cherub innocent pure knowing no evil blushing at every word perhaps she was like you proud ready to take offence not like the others perhaps she looked like a queen and knew what happiness was in store for the man who should love her and whom she should love do you see how it ended and what if at that very minute when she was beating on the filthy steps with that fish drunken and dishevelledwhat if at that very minute she recalled the pure early days in her fathers house when she used to go to school and the neighbours son watched for her on the way declaring that he would love her as long as he lived that he would devote his life to her and when they vowed to love one another for ever and be married as soon as they were grown up no liza it would be happy for you if you were to die soon of consumption in some corner in some cellar like that woman just now in the hospital do you say you will be lucky if they take you but what if you are still of use to the madam here consumption is a queer disease it is not like fever the patient goes on hoping till the last minute and says he is all right he deludes himself and that just suits your madam dont doubt it thats how it is you have sold your soul and what is more you owe money so you darent say a word but when you are dying all will abandon you all will turn away from you for then there will be nothing to get from you whats more they will reproach you for cumbering the place for being so long over dying however you beg you wont get a drink of water without abuse whenever are you going off you nasty hussy you wont let us sleep with your moaning you make the gentlemen sick thats true i have heard such things said myself they will thrust you dying into the filthiest corner in the cellarin the damp and darkness what will your thoughts be lying there alone when you die strange hands will lay you out with grumbling and impatience no one will bless you no one will sigh for you they only want to get rid of you as soon as may be they will buy a coffin take you to the grave as they did that poor woman today and celebrate your memory at the tavern in the grave sleet filth wet snowno need to put themselves out for youlet her down vanuha its just like her luckeven here she is headforemost the hussy shorten the cord you rascal its all right as it is all right is it why shes on her side she was a fellowcreature after all but never mind throw the earth on her and they wont care to waste much time quarrelling over you they will scatter the wet blue clay as quick as they can and go off to the tavern and there your memory on earth will end other women have children to go to their graves fathers husbands while for you neither tear nor sigh nor remembrance no one in the whole world will ever come to you your name will vanish from the face of the earthas though you had never existed never been born at all nothing but filth and mud however you knock at your coffin lid at night when the dead arise however you cry let me out kind people to live in the light of day my life was no life at all my life has been thrown away like a dishclout it was drunk away in the tavern at the haymarket let me out kind people to live in the world again and i worked myself up to such a pitch that i began to have a lump in my throat myself and and all at once i stopped sat up in dismay and bending over apprehensively began to listen with a beating heart i had reason to be troubled i had felt for some time that i was turning her soul upside down and rending her heart andand the more i was convinced of it the more eagerly i desired to gain my object as quickly and as effectually as possible it was the exercise of my skill that carried me away yet it was not merely sport i knew i was speaking stiffly artificially even bookishly in fact i could not speak except like a book but that did not trouble me i knew i felt that i should be understood and that this very bookishness might be an assistance but now having attained my effect i was suddenly panicstricken never before had i witnessed such despair she was lying on her face thrusting her face into the pillow and clutching it in both hands her heart was being torn her youthful body was shuddering all over as though in convulsions suppressed sobs rent her bosom and suddenly burst out in weeping and wailing then she pressed closer into the pillow she did not want any one here not a living soul to know of her anguish and her tears she bit the pillow bit her hand till it bled i saw that afterwards or thrusting her fingers into her dishevelled hair seemed rigid with the effort of restraint holding her breath and clenching her teeth i began saying something begging her to calm herself but felt that i did not dare and all at once in a sort of cold shiver almost in terror began fumbling in the dark trying hurriedly to get dressed to go it was dark though i tried my best i could not finish dressing quickly suddenly i felt a box of matches and a candlestick with a whole candle in it as soon as the room was lighted up liza sprang up sat up in bed and with a contorted face with a half insane smile looked at me almost senselessly i sat down beside her and took her hands she came to herself made an impulsive movement towards me would have caught hold of me but did not dare and slowly bowed her head before me liza my dear i was wrong forgive me my dear i began but she squeezed my hand in her fingers so tightly that i felt i was saying the wrong thing and stopped this is my address liza come to me i will come she answered resolutely her head still bowed but now i am going goodbye till we meet again i got up she too stood up and suddenly flushed all over gave a shudder snatched up a shawl that was lying on a chair and muffled herself in it to her chin as she did this she gave another sickly smile blushed and looked at me strangely i felt wretched i was in haste to get awayto disappear wait a minute she said suddenly in the passage just at the doorway stopping me with her hand on my overcoat she put down the candle in hot haste and ran off evidently she had thought of something or wanted to show me something as she ran away she flushed her eyes shone and there was a smile on her lipswhat was the meaning of it against my will i waited she came back a minute later with an expression that seemed to ask forgiveness for something in fact it was not the same face not the same look as the evening before sullen mistrustful and obstinate her eyes now were imploring soft and at the same time trustful caressing timid the expression with which children look at people they are very fond of of whom they are asking a favour her eyes were a light hazel they were lovely eyes full of life and capable of expressing love as well as sullen hatred making no explanation as though i as a sort of higher being must understand everything without explanations she held out a piece of paper to me her whole face was positively beaming at that instant with nave almost childish triumph i unfolded it it was a letter to her from a medical student or some one of that sorta very highflown and flowery but extremely respectful loveletter i dont recall the words now but i remember well that through the highflown phrases there was apparent a genuine feeling which cannot be feigned when i had finished reading it i met her glowing questioning and childishly impatient eyes fixed upon me she fastened her eyes upon my face and waited impatiently for what i should say in a few words hurriedly but with a sort of joy and pride she explained to me that she had been to a dance somewhere in a private house a family of very nice people who knew nothing absolutely nothing for she had only come here so lately and it had all happened and she hadnt made up her mind to stay and was certainly going away as soon as she had paid her debt and at that party there had been the student who had danced with her all the evening he had talked to her and it turned out that he had known her in old days at riga when he was a child they had played together but a very long time agoand he knew her parents but about this he knew nothing nothing whatever and had no suspicion and the day after the dance three days ago he had sent her that letter through the friend with whom she had gone to the party and well that was all she dropped her shining eyes with a sort of bashfulness as she finished the poor girl was keeping that students letter as a precious treasure and had run to fetch it her only treasure because she did not want me to go away without knowing that she too was honestly and genuinely loved that she too was addressed respectfully no doubt that letter was destined to lie in her box and lead to nothing but none the less i am certain that she would keep it all her life as a precious treasure as her pride and justification and now at such a minute she had thought of that letter and brought it with nave pride to raise herself in my eyes that i might see that i too might think well of her i said nothing pressed her hand and went out i so longed to get away i walked all the way home in spite of the fact that the melting snow was still falling in heavy flakes i was exhausted shattered in bewilderment but behind the bewilderment the truth was already gleaming the loathsome truth viii it was some time however before i consented to recognize that truth waking up in the morning after some hours of heavy leaden sleep and immediately realizing all that had happened on the previous day i was positively amazed at my last nights sentimentality with liza at all those outcries of horror and pity to think of having such an attack of womanish hysteria pah i concluded and what did i thrust my address upon her for what if she comes let her come though it doesnt matter but obviously that was not now the chief and the most important matter i had to make haste and at all costs save my reputation in the eyes of zverkov and simonov as quickly as possible that was the chief business and i was so taken up that morning that i actually forgot all about liza first of all i had at once to repay what i had borrowed the day before from simonov i resolved on a desperate measure to borrow fifteen roubles straight off from anton antonitch as luck would have it he was in the best of humours that morning and gave it to me at once on the first asking i was so delighted at this that as i signed the i o u with a swaggering air i told him casually that the night before i had been keeping it up with some friends at the htel de paris we were giving a farewell party to a comrade in fact i might say a friend of my childhood and you knowa desperate rake fearfully spoiltof course he belongs to a good family and has considerable means a brilliant career he is witty charming a regular lovelace you understand we drank an extra halfdozen and and it went off all right all this was uttered very easily unconstrainedly and complacently on reaching home i promptly wrote to simonov to this hour i am lost in admiration when i recall the truly gentlemanly goodhumoured candid tone of my letter with tact and goodbreeding and above all entirely without superfluous words i blamed myself for all that had happened i defended myself if i really may be allowed to defend myself by alleging that being utterly unaccustomed to wine i had been intoxicated with the first glass which i said i had drunk before they arrived while i was waiting for them at the htel de paris between five and six oclock i begged simonovs pardon especially i asked him to convey my explanations to all the others especially to zverkov whom i seemed to remember as though in a dream i had insulted i added that i would have called upon all of them myself but my head ached and besides i had not the face to i was particularly pleased with a certain lightness almost carelessness strictly within the bounds of politeness however which was apparent in my style and better than any possible arguments gave them at once to understand that i took rather an independent view of all that unpleasantness last night that i was by no means so utterly crushed as you my friends probably imagine but on the contrary looked upon it as a gentleman serenely respecting himself should look upon it on a young heros past no censure is cast there is actually an aristocratic playfulness about it i thought admiringly as i read over the letter and its all because i am an intellectual and cultivated man another man in my place would not have known how to extricate himself but here i have got out of it and am as jolly as ever again and all because i am a cultivated and educated man of our day and indeed perhaps everything was due to the wine yesterday hm no it was not the wine i did not drink anything at all between five and six when i was waiting for them i had lied to simonov i had lied shamelessly and indeed i wasnt ashamed now hang it all though the great thing was that i was rid of it i put six roubles in the letter sealed it up and asked apollon to take it to simonov when he learned that there was money in the letter apollon became more respectful and agreed to take it towards evening i went out for a walk my head was still aching and giddy after yesterday but as evening came on and the twilight grew denser my impressions and following them my thoughts grew more and more different and confused something was not dead within me in the depths of my heart and conscience it would not die and it showed itself in acute depression for the most part i jostled my way through the most crowded business streets along myeshtchansky street along sadovy street and in yusupov garden i always liked particularly sauntering along these streets in the dusk just when there were crowds of working people of all sorts going home from their daily work with faces looking cross with anxiety what i liked was just that cheap bustle that bare prose on this occasion the jostling of the streets irritated me more than ever i could not make out what was wrong with me i could not find the clue something seemed rising up continually in my soul painfully and refusing to be appeased i returned home completely upset it was just as though some crime were lying on my conscience the thought that liza was coming worried me continually it seemed queer to me that of all my recollections of yesterday this tormented me as it were especially as it were quite separately everything else i had quite succeeded in forgetting by the evening i dismissed it all and was still perfectly satisfied with my letter to simonov but on this point i was not satisfied at all it was as though i were worried only by liza what if she comes i thought incessantly well it doesnt matter let her come hm its horrid that she should see for instance how i live yesterday i seemed such a hero to her while now hm its horrid though that i have let myself go so the room looks like a beggars and i brought myself to go out to dinner in such a suit and my american leather sofa with the stuffing sticking out and my dressinggown which will not cover me such tatters and she will see all this and she will see apollon that beast is certain to insult her he will fasten upon her in order to be rude to me and i of course shall be panicstricken as usual i shall begin bowing and scraping before her and pulling my dressinggown round me i shall begin smiling telling lies oh the beastliness and it isnt the beastliness of it that matters most there is something more important more loathsome viler yes viler and to put on that dishonest lying mask again when i reached that thought i fired up all at once why dishonest how dishonest i was speaking sincerely last night i remember there was real feeling in me too what i wanted was to excite an honourable feeling in her her crying was a good thing it will have a good effect yet i could not feel at ease all that evening even when i had come back home even after nine oclock when i calculated that liza could not possibly come she still haunted me and what was worse she came back to my mind always in the same position one moment out of all that had happened last night stood vividly before my imagination the moment when i struck a match and saw her pale distorted face with its look of torture and what a pitiful what an unnatural what a distorted smile she had at that moment but i did not know then that fifteen years later i should still in my imagination see liza always with the pitiful distorted inappropriate smile which was on her face at that minute next day i was ready again to look upon it all as nonsense due to overexcited nerves and above all as exaggerated i was always conscious of that weak point of mine and sometimes very much afraid of it i exaggerate everything that is where i go wrong i repeated to myself every hour but however liza will very likely come all the same was the refrain with which all my reflections ended i was so uneasy that i sometimes flew into a fury shell come she is certain to come i cried running about the room if not today she will come tomorrow shell find me out the damnable romanticism of these pure hearts oh the vilenessoh the sillinessoh the stupidity of these wretched sentimental souls why how fail to understand how could one fail to understand but at this point i stopped short and in great confusion indeed and how few how few words i thought in passing were needed how little of the idyllic and affectedly bookishly artificially idyllic too had sufficed to turn a whole human life at once according to my will thats virginity to be sure freshness of soil at times a thought occurred to me to go to her to tell her all and beg her not to come to me but this thought stirred such wrath in me that i believed i should have crushed that damned liza if she had chanced to be near me at the time i should have insulted her have spat at her have turned her out have struck her one day passed however another and another she did not come and i began to grow calmer i felt particularly bold and cheerful after nine oclock i even sometimes began dreaming and rather sweetly i for instance became the salvation of liza simply through her coming to me and my talking to her i develop her educate her finally i notice that she loves me loves me passionately i pretend not to understand i dont know however why i pretend just for effect perhaps at last all confusion transfigured trembling and sobbing she flings herself at my feet and says that i am her saviour and that she loves me better than anything in the world i am amazed but liza i say can you imagine that i have not noticed your love i saw it all i divined it but i did not dare to approach you first because i had an influence over you and was afraid that you would force yourself from gratitude to respond to my love would try to rouse in your heart a feeling which was perhaps absent and i did not wish that because it would be tyranny it would be indelicate in short i launch off at that point into european inexplicably lofty subtleties la george sand but now now you are mine you are my creation you are pure you are good you are my noble wife into my house come bold and free its rightful mistress there to be then we begin living together go abroad and so on and so on in fact in the end it seemed vulgar to me myself and i began putting out my tongue at myself besides they wont let her out the hussy i thought they dont let them go out very readily especially in the evening for some reason i fancied she would come in the evening and at seven oclock precisely though she did say she was not altogether a slave there yet and had certain rights so hm damn it all she will come she is sure to come it was a good thing in fact that apollon distracted my attention at that time by his rudeness he drove me beyond all patience he was the bane of my life the curse laid upon me by providence we had been squabbling continually for years and i hated him my god how i hated him i believe i had never hated any one in my life as i hated him especially at some moments he was an elderly dignified man who worked part of his time as a tailor but for some unknown reason he despised me beyond all measure and looked down upon me insufferably though indeed he looked down upon every one simply to glance at that flaxen smoothly brushed head at the tuft of hair he combed up on his forehead and oiled with sunflower oil at that dignified mouth compressed into the shape of the letter v made one feel one was confronting a man who never doubted of himself he was a pedant to the most extreme point the greatest pedant i had met on earth and with that had a vanity only befitting alexander of macedon he was in love with every button on his coat every nail on his fingersabsolutely in love with them and he looked it in his behaviour to me he was a perfect tyrant he spoke very little to me and if he chanced to glance at me he gave me a firm majestically selfconfident and invariably ironical look that drove me sometimes to fury he did his work with the air of doing me the greatest favour though he did scarcely anything for me and did not indeed consider himself bound to do anything there could be no doubt that he looked upon me as the greatest fool on earth and that he did not get rid of me was simply that he could get wages from me every month he consented to do nothing for me for seven roubles a month many sins should be forgiven me for what i suffered from him my hatred reached such a point that sometimes his very step almost threw me into convulsions what i loathed particularly was his lisp his tongue must have been a little too long or something of that sort for he continually lisped and seemed to be very proud of it imagining that it greatly added to his dignity he spoke in a slow measured tone with his hands behind his back and his eyes fixed on the ground he maddened me particularly when he read aloud the psalms to himself behind his partition many a battle i waged over that reading but he was awfully fond of reading aloud in the evenings in a slow even singsong voice as though over the dead it is interesting that that is how he has ended he hires himself out to read the psalms over the dead and at the same time he kills rats and makes blacking but at that time i could not get rid of him it was as though he were chemically combined with my existence besides nothing would have induced him to consent to leave me i could not live in furnished lodgings my lodging was my private solitude my shell my cave in which i concealed myself from all mankind and apollon seemed to me for some reason an integral part of that flat and for seven years i could not turn him away to be two or three days behind with his wages for instance was impossible he would have made such a fuss i should not have known where to hide my head but i was so exasperated with every one during those days that i made up my mind for some reason and with some object to punish apollon and not to pay him for a fortnight the wages that were owing him i had for a long timefor the last two yearsbeen intending to do this simply in order to teach him not to give himself airs with me and to show him that if i liked i could withhold his wages i purposed to say nothing to him about it and was purposely silent indeed in order to score off his pride and force him to be the first to speak of his wages then i would take the seven roubles out of a drawer show him i have the money put aside on purpose but that i wont i wont i simply wont pay him his wages i wont just because that is what i wish because i am master and it is for me to decide because he has been disrespectful because he has been rude but if he were to ask respectfully i might be softened and give it to him otherwise he might wait another fortnight another three weeks a whole month but angry as i was yet he got the better of me i could not hold out for four days he began as he always did begin in such cases for there had been such cases already there had been attempts and it may be observed i knew all this beforehand i knew his nasty tactics by heart he would begin by fixing upon me an exceedingly severe stare keeping it up for several minutes at a time particularly on meeting me or seeing me out of the house if i held out and pretended not to notice these stares he would still in silence proceed to further tortures all at once propos of nothing he would walk softly and smoothly into my room when i was pacing up and down or reading stand at the door one hand behind his back and one foot behind the other and fix upon me a stare more than severe utterly contemptuous if i suddenly asked him what he wanted he would make me no answer but continue staring at me persistently for some seconds then with a peculiar compression of his lips and a most significant air deliberately turn round and deliberately go back to his room two hours later he would come out again and again present himself before me in the same way it had happened that in my fury i did not even ask him what he wanted but simply raised my head sharply and imperiously and began staring back at him so we stared at one another for two minutes at last he turned with deliberation and dignity and went back again for two hours if i were still not brought to reason by all this but persisted in my revolt he would suddenly begin sighing while he looked at me long deep sighs as though measuring by them the depths of my moral degradation and of course it ended at last by his triumphing completely i raged and shouted but still was forced to do what he wanted this time the usual staring manoeuvres had scarcely begun when i lost my temper and flew at him in a fury i was irritated beyond endurance apart from him stay i cried in a frenzy as he was slowly and silently turning with one hand behind his back to go to his room stay come back come back i tell you and i must have bawled so unnaturally that he turned round and even looked at me with some wonder however he persisted in saying nothing and that infuriated me how dare you come and look at me like that without being sent for answer after looking at me calmly for half a minute he began turning round again stay i roared running up to him dont stir there answer now what did you come in to look at if you have any order to give me its my duty to carry it out he answered after another silent pause with a slow measured lisp raising his eyebrows and calmly twisting his head from one side to another all this with exasperating composure thats not what i am asking you about you torturer i shouted turning crimson with anger ill tell you why you came here myself you see i dont give you your wages you are so proud you dont want to bow down and ask for it and so you come to punish me with your stupid stares to worry me and you have no suspicion how stupid it isstupid stupid stupid stupid he would have turned round again without a word but i seized him listen i shouted to him heres the money do you see here it is i took it out of the table drawer heres the seven roubles complete but you are not going to have it you are not going to have it until you come respectfully with bowed head to beg my pardon do you hear that cannot be he answered with the most unnatural selfconfidence it shall be so i said i give you my word of honour it shall be and theres nothing for me to beg your pardon for he went on as though he had not noticed my exclamations at all why besides you called me a torturer for which i can summon you at the policestation at any time for insulting behaviour go summon me i roared go at once this very minute this very second you are a torturer all the same a torturer but he merely looked at me then turned and regardless of my loud calls to him he walked to his room with an even step and without looking round if it had not been for liza nothing of this would have happened i decided inwardly then after waiting a minute i went myself behind his screen with a dignified and solemn air though my heart was beating slowly and violently apollon i said quietly and emphatically though i was breathless go at once without a minutes delay and fetch the policeofficer he had meanwhile settled himself at his table put on his spectacles and taken up some sewing but hearing my order he burst into a guffaw at once go this minute go on or else you cant imagine what will happen you are certainly out of your mind he observed without even raising his head lisping as deliberately as ever and threading his needle whoever heard of a man sending for the police against himself and as for being frightenedyou are upsetting yourself about nothing for nothing will come of it go i shrieked clutching him by the shoulder i felt i should strike him in a minute but i did not notice the door from the passage softly and slowly open at that instant and a figure come in stop short and begin staring at us in perplexity i glanced nearly swooned with shame and rushed back to my room there clutching at my hair with both hands i leaned my head against the wall and stood motionless in that position two minutes later i heard apollons deliberate footsteps there is some woman asking for you he said looking at me with peculiar severity then he stood aside and let in liza he would not go away but stared at us sarcastically go away go away i commanded in desperation at that moment my clock began whirring and wheezing and struck seven ix into my house come bold and free its rightful mistress there to be i stood before her crushed crestfallen revoltingly confused and i believe i smiled as i did my utmost to wrap myself in the skirts of my ragged wadded dressinggownexactly as i had imagined the scene not long before in a fit of depression after standing over us for a couple of minutes apollon went away but that did not make me more at ease what made it worse was that she too was overwhelmed with confusion more so in fact than i should have expected at the sight of me of course sit down i said mechanically moving a chair up to the table and i sat down on the sofa she obediently sat down at once and gazed at me openeyed evidently expecting something from me at once this navet of expectation drove me to fury but i restrained myself she ought to have tried not to notice as though everything had been as usual while instead of that she and i dimly felt that i should make her pay dearly for all this you have found me in a strange position liza i began stammering and knowing that this was the wrong way to begin no no dont imagine anything i cried seeing that she had suddenly flushed i am not ashamed of my poverty on the contrary i look with pride on my poverty i am poor but honourable one can be poor and honourable i muttered however would you like tea no she was beginning wait a minute i leapt up and ran to apollon i had to get out of the room somehow apollon i whispered in feverish haste flinging down before him the seven roubles which had remained all the time in my clenched fist here are your wages you see i give them to you but for that you must come to my rescue bring me tea and a dozen rusks from the restaurant if you wont go youll make me a miserable man you dont know what this woman is this iseverything you may be imagining something but you dont know what that woman is apollon who had already sat down to his work and put on his spectacles again at first glanced askance at the money without speaking or putting down his needle then without paying the slightest attention to me or making any answer he went on busying himself with his needle which he had not yet threaded i waited before him for three minutes with my arms crossed la napolon my temples were moist with sweat i was pale i felt it but thank god he must have been moved to pity looking at me having threaded his needle he deliberately got up from his seat deliberately moved back his chair deliberately took off his spectacles deliberately counted the money and finally asking me over his shoulder shall i get a whole portion deliberately walked out of the room as i was going back to liza the thought occurred to me on the way shouldnt i run away just as i was in my dressinggown no matter where and then let happen what would i sat down again she looked at me uneasily for some minutes we were silent i will kill him i shouted suddenly striking the table with my fist so that the ink spurted out of the inkstand what are you saying she cried starting i will kill him kill him i shrieked suddenly striking the table in absolute frenzy and at the same time fully understanding how stupid it was to be in such a frenzy you dont know liza what that torturer is to me he is my torturer he has gone now to fetch some rusks he and suddenly i burst into tears it was an hysterical attack how ashamed i felt in the midst of my sobs but still i could not restrain them she was frightened what is the matter what is wrong she cried fussing about me water give me water over there i muttered in a faint voice though i was inwardly conscious that i could have got on very well without water and without muttering in a faint voice but i was what is called putting it on to save appearances though the attack was a genuine one she gave me water looking at me in bewilderment at that moment apollon brought in the tea it suddenly seemed to me that this commonplace prosaic tea was horribly undignified and paltry after all that had happened and i blushed crimson liza looked at apollon with positive alarm he went out without a glance at either of us liza do you despise me i asked looking at her fixedly trembling with impatience to know what she was thinking she was confused and did not know what to answer drink your tea i said to her angrily i was angry with myself but of course it was she who would have to pay for it a horrible spite against her suddenly surged up in my heart i believe i could have killed her to revenge myself on her i swore inwardly not to say a word to her all the time she is the cause of it all i thought our silence lasted for five minutes the tea stood on the table we did not touch it i had got to the point of purposely refraining from beginning in order to embarrass her further it was awkward for her to begin alone several times she glanced at me with mournful perplexity i was obstinately silent i was of course myself the chief sufferer because i was fully conscious of the disgusting meanness of my spiteful stupidity and yet at the same time i could not restrain myself i want to get away from there altogether she began to break the silence in some way but poor girl that was just what she ought not to have spoken about at such a stupid moment to a man so stupid as i was my heart positively ached with pity for her tactless and unnecessary straightforwardness but something hideous at once stifled all compassion in me it even provoked me to greater venom i did not care what happened another five minutes passed perhaps i am in your way she began timidly hardly audibly and was getting up but as soon as i saw this first impulse of wounded dignity i positively trembled with spite and at once burst out why have you come to me tell me that please i began gasping for breath and regardless of logical connection in my words i longed to have it all out at once at one burst i did not even trouble how to begin why have you come answer answer i cried hardly knowing what i was doing ill tell you my good girl why you have come youve come because i talked sentimental stuff to you then so now you are soft as butter and longing for fine sentiments again so you may as well know that i was laughing at you then and i am laughing at you now why are you shuddering yes i was laughing at you i had been insulted just before at dinner by the fellows who came that evening before me i came to you meaning to thrash one of them an officer but i didnt succeed i didnt find him i had to avenge the insult on some one to get back my own again you turned up i vented my spleen on you and laughed at you i had been humiliated so i wanted to humiliate i had been treated like a rag so i wanted to show my power thats what it was and you imagined i had come there on purpose to save you yes you imagined that you imagined that i knew that she would perhaps be muddled and not take it all in exactly but i knew too that she would grasp the gist of it very well indeed and so indeed she did she turned white as a handkerchief tried to say something and her lips worked painfully but she sank on a chair as though she had been felled by an axe and all the time afterwards she listened to me with her lips parted and her eyes wide open shuddering with awful terror the cynicism the cynicism of my words overwhelmed her save you i went on jumping up from my chair and running up and down the room before her save you from what but perhaps i am worse than you myself why didnt you throw it in my teeth when i was giving you that sermon but what did you come here yourself for was it to read us a sermon power power was what i wanted then sport was what i wanted i wanted to wring out your tears your humiliation your hysteriathat was what i wanted then of course i couldnt keep it up then because i am a wretched creature i was frightened and the devil knows why gave you my address in my folly afterwards before i got home i was cursing and swearing at you because of that address i hated you already because of the lies i had told you because i only like playing with words only dreaming but do you know what i really want is that you should all go to hell that is what i want i want peace yes id sell the whole world for a farthing straight off so long as i was left in peace is the world to go to pot or am i to go without my tea i say that the world may go to pot for me so long as i always get my tea did you know that or not well anyway i know that i am a blackguard a scoundrel an egoist a sluggard here i have been shuddering for the last three days at the thought of your coming and do you know what has worried me particularly for these three days that i posed as such a hero to you and now you would see me in a wretched torn dressinggown beggarly loathsome i told you just now that i was not ashamed of my poverty so you may as well know that i am ashamed of it i am more ashamed of it than of anything more afraid of it than of being found out if i were a thief because i am as vain as though i had been skinned and the very air blowing on me hurt surely by now you must realize that i shall never forgive you for having found me in this wretched dressinggown just as i was flying at apollon like a spiteful cur the saviour the former hero was flying like a mangy unkempt sheepdog at his lackey and the lackey was jeering at him and i shall never forgive you for the tears i could not help shedding before you just now like some silly woman put to shame and for what i am confessing to you now i shall never forgive you either yesyou must answer for it all because you turned up like this because i am a blackguard because i am the nastiest stupidest absurdest and most envious of all the worms on earth who are not a bit better than i am but the devil knows why are never put to confusion while i shall always be insulted by every louse that is my doom and what is it to me that you dont understand a word of this and what do i care what do i care about you and whether you go to ruin there or not do you understand how i shall hate you now after saying this for having been here and listening why its not once in a lifetime a man speaks out like this and then it is in hysterics what more do you want why do you still stand confronting me after all this why are you worrying me why dont you go but at this point a strange thing happened i was so accustomed to think and imagine everything from books and to picture everything in the world to myself just as i had made it up in my dreams beforehand that i could not all at once take in this strange circumstance what happened was this liza insulted and crushed by me understood a great deal more than i imagined she understood from all this what a woman understands first of all if she feels genuine love that is that i was myself unhappy the frightened and wounded expression on her face was followed first by a look of sorrowful perplexity when i began calling myself a scoundrel and a blackguard and my tears flowed the tirade was accompanied throughout by tears her whole face worked convulsively she was on the point of getting up and stopping me when i finished she took no notice of my shouting why are you here why dont you go away but realized only that it must have been very bitter to me to say all this besides she was so crushed poor girl she considered herself infinitely beneath me how could she feel anger or resentment she suddenly leapt up from her chair with an irresistible impulse and held out her hands yearning towards me though still timid and not daring to stir at this point there was a revulsion in my heart too then she suddenly rushed to me threw her arms round me and burst into tears i too could not restrain myself and sobbed as i never had before they wont let me i cant be good i managed to articulate then i went to the sofa fell on it face downwards and sobbed on it for a quarter of an hour in genuine hysterics she came close to me put her arms round me and stayed motionless in that position but the trouble was that the hysterics could not go on for ever and i am writing the loathsome truth lying face downwards on the sofa with my face thrust into my nasty leather pillow i began by degrees to be aware of a faraway involuntary but irresistible feeling that it would be awkward now for me to raise my head and look liza straight in the face why was i ashamed i dont know but i was ashamed the thought too came into my overwrought brain that our parts now were completely changed that she was now the heroine while i was just such a crushed and humiliated creature as she had been before me that nightfour days before and all this came into my mind during the minutes i was lying on my face on the sofa my god surely i was not envious of her then i dont know to this day i cannot decide and at the time of course i was still less able to understand what i was feeling than now i cannot get on without domineering and tyrannizing over some one but there is no explaining anything by reasoning and so it is useless to reason i conquered myself however and raised my head i had to do so sooner or later and i am convinced to this day that it was just because i was ashamed to look at her that another feeling was suddenly kindled and flamed up in my heart a feeling of mastery and possession my eyes gleamed with passion and i gripped her hands tightly how i hated her and how i was drawn to her at that minute the one feeling intensified the other it was almost like an act of vengeance at first there was a look of amazement even of terror on her face but only for one instant she warmly and rapturously embraced me x a quarter of an hour later i was rushing up and down the room in frenzied impatience from minute to minute i went up to the screen and peeped through the crack at liza she was sitting on the ground with her head leaning against the bed and must have been crying but she did not go away and that irritated me this time she understood it all i had insulted her finally but theres no need to describe it she realized that my outburst of passion had been simply revenge a fresh humiliation and that to my earlier almost causeless hatred was added now a personal hatred born of envy though i do not maintain positively that she understood all this distinctly but she certainly did fully understand that i was a despicable man and what was worse incapable of loving her i know i shall be told that this is incrediblebut it is incredible to be as spiteful and stupid as i was it may be added that it was strange i should not love her or at any rate appreciate her love why is it strange in the first place by then i was incapable of love for i repeat with me loving meant tyrannizing and showing my moral superiority i have never in my life been able to imagine any other sort of love and have nowadays come to the point of sometimes thinking that love really consists in the rightfreely given by the beloved objectto tyrannize over her even in my underground dreams i did not imagine love except as a struggle i began it always with hatred and ended it with moral subjugation and afterwards i never knew what to do with the subjugated object and what is there to wonder at in that since i had succeeded in so corrupting myself since i was so out of touch with real life as to have actually thought of reproaching her and putting her to shame for having come to me to hear fine sentiments and did not even guess that she had come not to hear fine sentiments but to love me because to a woman all reformation all salvation from any sort of ruin and all moral renewal is included in love and can only show itself in that form i did not hate her so much however when i was running about the room and peeping through the crack in the screen i was only insufferably oppressed by her being here i wanted her to disappear i wanted peace to be left alone in my underground world real life oppressed me with its novelty so much that i could hardly breathe but several minutes passed and she still remained without stirring as though she were unconscious i had the shamelessness to tap softly at the screen as though to remind her she started sprang up and flew to seek her kerchief her hat her coat as though making her escape from me two minutes later she came from behind the screen and looked with heavy eyes at me i gave a spiteful grin which was forced however to keep up appearances and i turned away from her eyes goodbye she said going towards the door i ran up to her seized her hand opened it thrust something in it and closed it again then i turned at once and dashed away in haste to the other corner of the room to avoid seeing anyway i did mean a moment since to tell a lieto write that i did this accidentally not knowing what i was doing through foolishness through losing my head but i dont want to lie and so i will say straight out that i opened her hand and put the money in it from spite it came into my head to do this while i was running up and down the room and she was sitting behind the screen but this i can say for certain though i did that cruel thing purposely it was not an impulse from the heart but came from my evil brain this cruelty was so affected so purposely made up so completely a product of the brain of books that i could not even keep it up a minutefirst i dashed away to avoid seeing her and then in shame and despair rushed after liza i opened the door in the passage and began listening liza liza i cried on the stairs but in a low voice not boldly there was no answer but i fancied i heard her footsteps lower down on the stairs liza i cried more loudly no answer but at that minute i heard the stiff outer glass door open heavily with a creak and slam violently the sound echoed up the stairs she had gone i went back to my room in hesitation i felt horribly oppressed i stood still at the table beside the chair on which she had sat and looked aimlessly before me a minute passed suddenly i started straight before me on the table i saw in short i saw a crumpled blue fiverouble note the one i had thrust into her hand a minute before it was the same note it could be no other there was no other in the flat so she had managed to fling it from her hand on the table at the moment when i had dashed into the further corner well i might have expected that she would do that might i have expected it no i was such an egoist i was so lacking in respect for my fellowcreatures that i could not even imagine she would do so i could not endure it a minute later i flew like a madman to dress flinging on what i could at random and ran headlong after her she could not have got two hundred paces away when i ran out into the street it was a still night and the snow was coming down in masses and falling almost perpendicularly covering the pavement and the empty street as though with a pillow there was no one in the street no sound was to be heard the street lamps gave a disconsolate and useless glimmer i ran two hundred paces to the crossroads and stopped short where had she gone and why was i running after her why to fall down before her to sob with remorse to kiss her feet to entreat her forgiveness i longed for that my whole breast was being rent to pieces and never never shall i recall that minute with indifference butwhat for i thought should i not begin to hate her perhaps even tomorrow just because i had kissed her feet today should i give her happiness had i not recognized that day for the hundredth time what i was worth should i not torture her i stood in the snow gazing into the troubled darkness and pondered this and will it not be better i mused fantastically afterwards at home stifling the living pang of my heart with fantastic dreams will it not be better that she should keep the resentment of the insult for ever resentmentwhy it is purification it is a most stinging and painful consciousness tomorrow i should have defiled her soul and have exhausted her heart while now the feeling of insult will never die in her heart and however loathsome the filth awaiting herthe feeling of insult will elevate and purify her by hatred hm perhaps too by forgiveness will all that make things easier for her though and indeed i will ask on my own account here an idle question which is bettercheap happiness or exalted sufferings well which is better so i dreamed as i sat at home that evening almost dead with the pain in my soul never had i endured such suffering and remorse yet could there have been the faintest doubt when i ran out from my lodging that i should turn back halfway i never met liza again and i have heard nothing of her i will add too that i remained for a long time afterwards pleased with the phrase about the benefit from resentment and hatred in spite of the fact that i almost fell ill from misery even now so many years later all this is somehow a very evil memory i have many evil memories now but hadnt i better end my notes here i believe i made a mistake in beginning to write them anyway i have felt ashamed all the time ive been writing this story so its hardly literature so much as a corrective punishment why to tell long stories showing how i have spoiled my life through morally rotting in my corner through lack of fitting environment through divorce from real life and rankling spite in my underground world would certainly not be interesting a novel needs a hero and all the traits for an antihero are expressly gathered together here and what matters most it all produces an unpleasant impression for we are all divorced from life we are all cripples every one of us more or less we are so divorced from it that we feel at once a sort of loathing for real life and so cannot bear to be reminded of it why we have come almost to looking upon real life as an effort almost as hard work and we are all privately agreed that it is better in books and why do we fuss and fume sometimes why are we perverse and ask for something else we dont know what ourselves it would be the worse for us if our petulant prayers were answered come try give any one of us for instance a little more independence untie our hands widen the spheres of our activity relax the control and we yes i assure you we should be begging to be under control again at once i know that you will very likely be angry with me for that and will begin shouting and stamping speak for yourself you will say and for your miseries in your underground holes and dont dare to say all of usexcuse me gentlemen i am not justifying myself with that all of us as for what concerns me in particular i have only in my life carried to an extreme what you have not dared to carry halfway and whats more you have taken your cowardice for good sense and have found comfort in deceiving yourselves so that perhaps after all there is more life in me than in you look into it more carefully why we dont even know what living means now what it is and what it is called leave us alone without books and we shall be lost and in confusion at once we shall not know what to join on to what to cling to what to love and what to hate what to respect and what to despise we are oppressed at being menmen with a real individual body and blood we are ashamed of it we think it a disgrace and try to contrive to be some sort of impossible generalized man we are stillborn and for generations past have been begotten not by living fathers and that suits us better and better we are developing a taste for it soon we shall contrive to be born somehow from an idea but enough i dont want to write more from underground the notes of this paradoxalist do not end here however he could not refrain from going on with them but it seems to us that we may stop here a faint heart a story under the same roof in the same flat on the same fourth storey lived two young men colleagues in the service arkady ivanovitch nefedevitch and vasya shumkov the author of course feels the necessity of explaining to the reader why one is given his full title while the others name is abbreviated if only that such a mode of expression may not be regarded as unseemly and rather familiar but to do so it would first be necessary to explain and describe the rank and years and calling and duty in the service and even indeed the characters of the persons concerned and since there are so many writers who begin in that way the author of the proposed story solely in order to be unlike them that is some people will perhaps say entirely on account of his boundless vanity decides to begin straightaway with action having completed this introduction he begins towards six oclock on new years eve shumkov returned home arkady ivanovitch who was lying on the bed woke up and looked at his friend with halfclosed eyes he saw that vasya had on his very best trousers and a very clean shirt front that of course struck him where had vasya to go like that and he had not dined at home either meanwhile shumkov had lighted a candle and arkady ivanovitch guessed immediately that his friend was intending to wake him accidentally vasya did in fact clear his throat twice walked twice up and down the room and at last quite accidentally let the pipe which he had begun filling in the corner by the stove slip out of his hands arkady ivanovitch laughed to himself vasya give over pretending he said arkasha you are not asleep i really cannot say for certain it seems to me i am not oh arkasha how are you dear boy well brother well brother you dont know what i have to tell you i certainly dont know come here as though expecting this vasya went up to him at once not at all anticipating however treachery from arkady ivanovitch the other seized him very adroitly by the arms turned him over held him down and began as it is called strangling his victim and apparently this proceeding afforded the lighthearted arkady ivanovitch great satisfaction caught he cried caught arkasha arkasha what are you about let me go for goodness sake let me go i shall crumple my dress coat as though that mattered what do you want with a dress coat why were you so confiding as to put yourself in my hands tell me where have you been where have you dined arkasha for goodness sake let me go where have you dined why its about that i want to tell you tell away then but first let me go not a bit of it i wont let you go till you tell me arkasha arkasha but do you understand i cantit is utterly impossible cried vasya helplessly wriggling out of his friends powerful clutches you know there are subjects howsubjects why subjects that you cant talk about in such a position without losing your dignity its utterly impossible it would make it ridiculous and this is not a ridiculous matter it is important here hes going in for being important thats a new idea you tell me so as to make me laugh thats how you must tell me i dont want anything important or else you are no true friend of mine do you call yourself a friend eh arkasha i really cant well i dont want to hear well arkasha began vasya lying across the bed and doing his utmost to put all the dignity possible into his words arkasha if you like i will tell you only well what well i am engaged to be married without uttering another word arkady ivanovitch took vasya up in his arms like a baby though the latter was by no means short but rather long and thin and began dexterously carrying him up and down the room pretending that he was hushing him to sleep ill put you in your swaddling clothes master bridegroom he kept saying but seeing that vasya lay in his arms not stirring or uttering a word he thought better of it at once and reflecting that the joke had gone too far set him down in the middle of the room and kissed him on the cheek in the most genuine and friendly way vasya you are not angry arkasha listen come its new years eve oh im all right but why are you such a madman such a scatterbrain how many times i have told you arkasha its really not funny not funny at all oh well you are not angry oh im all right am i ever angry with any one but you have wounded me do you understand but how have i wounded you in what way i come to you as to a friend with a full heart to pour out my soul to you to tell you of my happiness what happiness why dont you speak oh well i am going to get married vasya answered with vexation for he really was a little exasperated you you are going to get married so you really mean it arkasha cried at the top of his voice no no but whats this he talks like this and his tears are flowing vasya my little vasya dont my little son is it true really and arkady ivanovitch flew to hug him again well do you see how it is now said vasya you are kind of course you are a friend i know that i come to you with such joy such rapture and all of a sudden i have to disclose all the joy of my heart all my rapture struggling across the bed in an undignified way you understand arkasha vasya went on half laughing you see it made it seem comic and in a sense i did not belong to myself at that minute i could not let this be slighted whats more if you had asked me her name i swear i would sooner you killed me than have answered you but vasya why did you not speak you should have told me all about it sooner and i would not have played the fool cried arkady ivanovitch in genuine despair come thats enough thats enough of course thats how it is you know what it all comes fromfrom my having a good heart what vexes me is that i could not tell you as i wanted to making you glad and happy telling you nicely and initiating you into my secret properly really arkasha i love you so much that i believe if it were not for you i shouldnt be getting married and in fact i shouldnt be living in this world at all arkady ivanovitch who was excessively sentimental cried and laughed at once as he listened to vasya vasya did the same both flew to embrace one another again and forgot the past how is ithow is it tell me all about it vasya i am astonished excuse me brother but i am utterly astonished its a perfect thunderbolt by jove nonsense nonsense brother you have made it up youve really made it up you are telling fibs cried arkady ivanovitch and he actually looked into vasyas face with genuine uncertainty but seeing in it the radiant confirmation of a positive intention of being married as soon as possible threw himself on the bed and began rolling from side to side in ecstasy till the walls shook vasya sit here he said at last sitting down on the bed i really dont know brother where to begin they looked at one another in joyful excitement who is she vasya the artemyevs vasya pronounced in a voice weak with emotion no well i did buzz into your ears about them at first and then i shut up and you noticed nothing ah arkasha if you knew how hard it was to keep it from you but i was afraid afraid to speak i thought it would all go wrong and you know i was in love arkasha my god my god you see this was the trouble he began pausing continually from agitation she had a suitor a year ago but he was suddenly ordered somewhere i knew himhe was a fellow bless him well he did not write at all he simply vanished they waited and waited wondering what it meant four months ago he suddenly came back married and has never set foot within their doors it was coarseshabby and they had no one to stand up for them she cried and cried poor girl and i fell in love with her indeed i had been in love with her long before all the time i began comforting her and was always going there well and i really dont know how it has all come about only she came to love

mock of me i dont dare to love any one well brother you understand you understand on that we got engaged on the spot i kept thinking and thinking and thinking and thinking i said to her how are we to tell your mother she said it will be hard wait a little shes afraid and now maybe she would not let you have me she keeps crying too without telling her i blurted it out to her mother today lizanka fell on her knees before her i did the same well she gave us her blessing arkasha arkasha my dear fellow we will live together no i wont part from you for anything vasya look at you as i may i cant believe it i dont believe it i swear i keep feeling as though listen how can you be engaged to be married how is it i didnt know eh do you know vasya i will confess it to you now i was thinking of getting married myself but now since you are going to be married it is just as good be happy be happy brother i feel so lighthearted now there is such sweetness in my soul said vasya getting up and pacing about the room excitedly dont you feel the same we shall be poor of course but we shall be happy and you know it is not a wild fancy our happiness is not a fairy tale we shall be happy in reality vasya vasya listen what said vasya standing before arkady ivanovitch the idea occurs to me i am really afraid to say it to you forgive me and settle my doubts what are you going to live on you know i am delighted that you are going to be married of course i am delighted and i dont know what to do with myself butwhat are you going to live on eh oh good heavens what a fellow you are arkasha said vasya looking at nefedevitch in profound astonishment what do you mean even her old mother even she did not think of that for two minutes when i put it all clearly before her you had better ask what they are living on they have five hundred roubles a year between the three of them the pension which is all they have since the father died she and her old mother and her little brother whose schooling is paid for out of that income toothat is how they live its you and i are the capitalists some good years it works out to as much as seven hundred for me i say vasya excuse me i really you

shall finish it is there a great deal left dont hinder me for goodness sake dont hinder me hold your tongue arkady ivanovitch went on tiptoe to the bed and sat down then suddenly wanted to get up but was obliged to sit down again remembering that he might interrupt him though he could not sit still for excitement it was evident that the news had thoroughly upset him and the first thrill of delight had not yet passed off he glanced at shumkov the latter glanced at him smiled and shook his finger at him then frowning severely as though all his energy and the success of his work depended upon it fixed his eyes on the papers it seemed that he too could not yet master his emotion he kept changing his pen fidgeting in his chair rearranging things and setting to work again but his hand trembled and refused to move arkasha ive talked to them about you he cried suddenly as though he had just remembered it yes cried arkasha i was just wanting to ask you that well well ill tell you everything afterwards of course it is my own fault but it quite went out of my head that i didnt mean to say anything till i had written four pages but i thought of you and of them i really cant write brother i keep thinking about you vasya smiled a silence followed phew what a horrid pen cried shumkov flinging it on the table in vexation he took another vasya listen one word well make haste and for the last time have you a great deal left to do ah brother vasya frowned as though there could be nothing more terrible and murderous in the whole world than such a question a lot a fearful lot do you know i have an idea what oh never mind never mind go on writing why what what its past six vasya here nefedevitch smiled and winked slyly at vasya though with a certain timidity not knowing how vasya would take it well what is it said vasya throwing down his pen looking him straight in the face and actually turning pale with excitement do you know what for goodness sake what is it i tell you what you are excited you wont get much done stop stop stop i have it i have itlisten said nefedevitch jumping up from the bed in delight preventing vasya from speaking and doing his utmost to ward off all objections first of all you must get calm you must pull yourself together mustnt you arkasha arkasha cried vasya jumping up from his chair i will work all night i will really of course of course you wont go to bed till morning i wont go to bed i wont go to bed at all no that wont do that wont do you must sleep go to bed at five i will call you at eight tomorrow is a holiday you can sit and scribble away all day long then the night andbut have you a great deal left to do yes look look vasya quivering with excitement and suspense showed the manuscript look i say brother thats not much my dear fellow theres some more of it said vasya looking very timidly at nefedevitch as though the decision whether he was to go or not depended upon the latter how much two signatures well whats that come i tell you what we shall have time to finish it by jove we shall arkasha vasya listen tonight on new years eve every one is at home with his family you and i are the only ones without a home or relations oh vasya nefedevitch clutched vasya and hugged him in his leonine arms arkasha its settled vasya boy i only wanted to say this you see vasyalisten bandylegs listen arkady stopped with his mouth open because he could not speak for delight vasya held him by the shoulders gazed into his face and moved his lips as though he wanted to speak for him well he brought out at last introduce me to them today arkady let us go to tea there i tell you what i tell you what we wont even stay to see in the new year well come away earlier cried vasya with genuine inspiration that is well go for two hours neither more nor less and then separation till i have finished vasya boy arkady three minutes later arkady was dressed in his best vasya did nothing but brush himself because he had been in such haste to work that he had not changed his trousers they hurried out into the street each more pleased than the other their way lay from the petersburg side to kolomna arkady ivanovitch stepped out boldly and vigorously so that from his walk alone one could see how glad he was at the good fortune of his friend who was more and more radiant with happiness vasya trotted along with shorter steps though his deportment was none the less dignified arkady ivanovitch in fact had never seen him before to such advantage at that moment he actually felt more respect for him and vasyas physical defect of which the reader is not yet aware vasya was slightly deformed which always called forth a feeling of loving sympathy in arkady ivanovitchs kind heart contributed to the deep tenderness the latter felt for him at this moment a tenderness of which vasya was in every way worthy arkady ivanovitch felt ready to weep with happiness but he restrained himself where are you going where are you going vasya it is nearer this way he cried seeing that vasya was making in the direction of voznesenky hold your tongue arkasha it really is nearer vasya do you know what arkasha vasya began mysteriously in a voice quivering with joy i tell you what i want to take lizanka a little present what sort of present at the corner here brother is madame lerouxs a wonderful shop well a cap my dear a cap i saw such a charming little cap today i inquired i was told it was the faon manon lescauta delightful thing cherrycoloured ribbons and if it is not dear arkasha even if it is dear i think you are superior to any of the poets vasya come along they ran along and two minutes later went into the shop they were met by a blackeyed frenchwoman with curls who from the first glance at her customers became as joyous and happy as they even happier if one may say so vasya was ready to kiss madame leroux in his delight arkasha he said in an undertone casting a casual glance at all the grand and beautiful things on little wooden stands on the huge table lovely things whats that whats this this one for instance this little sweet do you see vasya whispered pointing to a charming cap further away which was not the one he meant to buy because he had already from afar descried and fixed his eyes upon the real famous one standing at the other end he looked at it in such a way that one might have supposed some one was going to steal it or as though the cap itself might take wings and fly into the air just to prevent vasya from obtaining it look said arkady ivanovitch pointing to one i think thats better well arkasha that does you credit i begin to respect you for your taste said vasya resorting to cunning with arkasha in the tenderness of his heart your cap is charming but come this way where is there a better one brother look this way that said arkady doubtfully but when vasya incapable of restraining himself any longer took it from the stand from which it seemed to fly spontaneously as though delighted at falling at last into the hands of so good a customer and they heard the rustle of its ribbons ruches and lace an unexpected cry of delight broke from the powerful chest of arkady ivanovitch even madame leroux while maintaining her incontestable dignity and preeminence in matters of taste and remaining mute from condescension rewarded vasya with a smile of complete approbation everything in her glance gesture and smile saying at once yes you have chosen rightly and are worthy of the happiness which awaits you it has been dangling its charms in coy seclusion cried vasya transferring his tender feelings to the charming cap you have been hiding on purpose you sly little pet and he kissed it that is the air surrounding it for he was afraid to touch his treasure retiring as true worth and virtue arkady added enthusiastically quoting humorously from a comic paper he had read that morning well vasya hurrah arkasha you are witty today i predict you will make a sensation as women say madame leroux madame leroux what is your pleasure dear madame leroux madame leroux looked at arkady ivanovitch and smiled condescendingly you wouldnt believe how i adore you at this moment allow me to give you a kiss and vasya kissed the shopkeeper she certainly at that moment needed all her dignity to maintain her position with such a madcap but i contend that the innate spontaneous courtesy and grace with which madame leroux received vasyas enthusiasm was equally befitting she forgave him and how tactfully how graciously she knew how to behave in the circumstances how could she have been angry with vasya madame leroux how much five roubles in silver she answered straightening herself with a new smile and this one madame leroux said arkady ivanovitch pointing to his choice that one is eight roubles there you seethere you see come madame leroux tell me which is nicer more graceful more charming which of them suits you best the second is richer but your choice cest plus coquet then we will take it madame leroux took a sheet of very delicate paper pinned it up and the paper with the cap wrapped in it seemed even lighter than the paper alone vasya took it carefully almost holding his breath bowed to madame leroux said something else very polite to her and left the shop i am a ladys man i was born to be a ladys man said vasya laughing a little noiseless nervous laugh and dodging the passersby whom he suspected of designs for crushing his precious cap listen arkady brother he began a minute later and there was a note of triumph of infinite affection in his voice arkady i am so happy i am so happy vasya how glad i am dear boy no arkasha no i know that there is no limit to your affection for me but you cannot be feeling onehundredth part of what i am feeling at this moment my heart is so full so full arkasha i am not worthy of such happiness i feel that i am conscious of it why has it come to me he said his voice full of stifled sobs what have i done to deserve it tell me look what lots of people what lots of tears what sorrow what workaday life without a holiday while i i am loved by a girl like that i but you will see her yourself immediately you will appreciate her noble heart i was born in a humble station now i have a grade in the service and an independent incomemy salary i was born with a physical defect i am a little deformed see she loves me as i am yulian mastakovitch was so kind so attentive so gracious today he does not often talk to me he came up to me well how goes it vasya yes really he called me vasya are you going to have a good time for the holiday eh he laughed well the fact is your excellency i have work to do but then i plucked up courage and said and maybe i shall have a good time too your excellency i really said it he gave me the money on the spot then he said a couple of words more to me tears came into my eyes brother i actually cried and he too seemed touched he patted me on the shoulder and said feel always vasya as you feel this now vasya paused for an instant arkady ivanovitch turned away and he too wiped away a tear with his fist and and vasya went on i have never spoken to you of this arkady arkady you make me so happy with your affection without you i could not liveno no dont say anything arkady let me squeeze your hand let me thaank you again vasya could not finish arkady ivanovitch longed to throw himself on vasyas neck but as they were crossing the road and heard almost in their ears a shrill hi there they ran frightened and excited to the pavement arkady ivanovitch was positively relieved he set down vasyas outburst of gratitude to the exceptional circumstances of the moment he was vexed he felt that he had done so little for vasya hitherto he felt actually ashamed of himself when vasya began thanking him for so little but they had all their lives before them and arkady ivanovitch breathed more freely the artemyevs had quite given up expecting them the proof of it was that they had already sat down to tea and the old it seems are sometimes more clearsighted than the young even when the young are so exceptional lizanka had very earnestly maintained he isnt coming he isnt coming mamma i feel in my heart he is not coming while her mother on the contrary declared that she had a feeling that he would certainly come that he would not stay away that he would run round that he could have no office work now on new years eve even as lizanka opened the door she did not in the least expect to see them and greeted them breathlessly with her heart throbbing like a captured birds flushing and turning as red as a cherry a fruit which she wonderfully resembled good heavens what a surprise it was what a joyful oh broke from her lips deceiver my darling she cried throwing her arms round vasyas neck but imagine her amazement her sudden confusion just behind vasya as though trying to hide behind his back stood arkady ivanovitch a trifle out of countenance it must be admitted that he was awkward in the company of women very awkward indeed in fact on one occasion something occurred but of that later you must put yourself in his place however there was nothing to laugh at he was standing in the entry in his goloshes and overcoat and in a cap with flaps over the ears which he would have hastened to pull off but he had all twisted round in a hideous way a yellow knitted scarf which to make things worse was knotted at the back he had to disentangle all this to take it off as quickly as possible to show himself to more advantage for there is no one who does not prefer to show himself to advantage and then vasya vexatious insufferable vasya of course always the same dear kind vasya but now insufferable ruthless vasya here he shouted lizanka i have brought you my arkady what do you think of him he is my best friend embrace him kiss him lizanka give him a kiss in advance afterwardsyou will know him betteryou can take it back again well what i ask you was arkady ivanovitch to do and he had only untwisted half of the scarf so far i really am sometimes ashamed of vasyas excess of enthusiasm it is of course the sign of a good heart but its awkward not nice at last both went in the mother was unutterably delighted to make arkady ivanovitchs acquaintance she had heard so much about him she had but she did not finish a joyful oh ringing musically through the room interrupted her in the middle of a sentence good heavens lizanka was standing before the cap which had suddenly been unfolded before her gaze she clasped her hands with the utmost simplicity smiling such a smile oh heavens why had not madame leroux an even lovelier cap oh heavens but where could you find a lovelier cap it was quite firstrate where could you get a better one i mean it seriously this ingratitude on the part of lovers moves me in fact to indignation and even wounds me a little why look at it for yourself reader look what could be more beautiful than this little love of a cap come look at it but no no my strictures are uncalled for they had by now all agreed with me it had been a momentary aberration the blindness the delirium of feeling i am ready to forgive them but then you must look you must excuse me kind reader i am still talking about the cap made of tulle light as a feather a broad cherrycoloured ribbon covered with lace passing between the tulle and the ruche and at the back two wide long ribbonsthey would fall down a little below the nape of the neck all that the cap needed was to be tilted a little to the back of the head come look at it i ask you after that but i see you are not looking you think it does not matter you are looking in a different direction you are looking at two big tears big as pearls that rose in two jet black eyes quivered for one instant on the eyelashes and then dropped on the ethereal tulle of which madame lerouxs artistic masterpiece was composed and again i feel vexed those two tears were scarcely a tribute to the cap no to my mind such a gift should be given in cool blood as only then can its full worth be appreciated i am i confess dear reader entirely on the side of the cap they sat downvasya with lizanka and the old mother with arkady ivanovitch they began to talk and arkady ivanovitch did himself credit i am glad to say that for him one would hardly indeed have expected it of him after a couple of words about vasya he most successfully turned the conversation to yulian mastakovitch his patron and he talked so cleverly so cleverly that the subject was not exhausted for an hour you ought to have seen with what dexterity what tact arkady ivanovitch touched upon certain peculiarities of yulian mastakovitch which directly or indirectly affected vasya the mother was fascinated genuinely fascinated she admitted it herself she purposely called vasya aside and said to him that his friend was a most excellent and charming young man and what was of most account such a serious steady young man vasya almost laughed aloud with delight he remembered how the serious arkady had tumbled him on his bed for a quarter of an hour then the mother signed to vasya to follow her quietly and cautiously into the next room it must be admitted that she treated lizanka rather unfairly she behaved treacherously to her daughter in the fullness of her heart of course and showed vasya on the sly the present lizanka was preparing to give him for the new year it was a papercase embroidered in beads and gold in a very choice design on one side was depicted a stag absolutely lifelike running swiftly and so well done on the other side was the portrait of a celebrated general also an excellent likeness i cannot describe vasyas raptures meanwhile time was not being wasted in the parlour lizanka went straight up to arkady ivanovitch she took his hand she thanked him for something and arkady ivanovitch gathered that she was referring to her precious vasya lizanka was indeed deeply touched she had heard that arkady ivanovitch was such a true friend of her betrothed so loved him so watched over him guiding him at every step with helpful advice that she lizanka could hardly help thanking him could not refrain from feeling grateful and hoping that arkady ivanovitch might like her if only half as well as vasya then she began questioning him as to whether vasya was careful of his health expressed some apprehensions in regard to his marked impulsiveness of character and his lack of knowledge of men and practical life she said that she would in time watch over him religiously that she would take care of and cherish his lot and finally she hoped that arkady ivanovitch would not leave them but would live with them we three shall live like one she cried with extremely nave enthusiasm but it was time to go they tried of course to keep them but vasya answered point blank that it was impossible arkady ivanovitch said the same the reason was of course inquired into and it came out at once that there was work to be done entrusted to vasya by yulian mastakovitch urgent necessary dreadful work which must be handed in on the morning of the next day but one and that it was not only unfinished but had been completely laid aside the mamma sighed when she heard of this while lizanka was positively scared and hurried vasya off in alarm the last kiss lost nothing from this haste though brief and hurried it was only the more warm and ardent at last they parted and the two friends set off home both began at once confiding to each other their impressions as soon as they found themselves in the street and could they help it indeed arkady ivanovitch was in love desperately in love with lizanka and to whom could he better confide his feelings than to vasya the happy man himself and so he did he was not bashful but confessed everything at once to vasya vasya laughed heartily and was immensely delighted and even observed that this was all that was needed to make them greater friends than ever you have guessed my feelings vasya said arkady ivanovitch yes i love her as i love you she will be my good angel as well as yours for the radiance of your happiness will be shed on me too and i can bask in its warmth she will keep house for me too vasya my happiness will be in her hands let her keep house for me as she will for you yes friendship for you is friendship for her you are not separable for me now only i shall have two beings like you instead of one arkady paused in the fullness of his feelings while vasya was shaken to the depths of his being by his friends words the fact is he had never expected anything of the sort from arkady arkady ivanovitch was not very great at talking as a rule he was not fond of dreaming either now he gave way to the liveliest freshest rainbowtinted daydreams how i will protect and cherish you both he began again to begin with vasya i will be godfather to all your children every one of them and secondly vasya we must bestir ourselves about the future we must buy furniture and take a lodging so that you and she and i can each have a little room to ourselves do you know vasya ill run about tomorrow and look at the notices on the gates three no two rooms we should not need more i really believe vasya i talked nonsense this morning there will be money enough why as soon as i glanced into her eyes i calculated at once that there would be enough to live on it will all be for her oh how we will work now vasya we might venture up to twentyfive roubles for rent a lodging is everything brother nice rooms and at once a man is cheerful and his dreams are of the brightest hues and besides lizanka will keep the purse for both of us not a farthing will be wasted do you suppose i would go to a restaurant what do you take me for not on any account and then we shall get a bonus and reward for we shall be zealous in the serviceoh how we shall work like oxen toiling in the fields only fancy and arkady ivanovitchs voice was faint with pleasure all at once and quite unexpected twentyfive or thirty roubles whenever theres an extra therell be a cap or a scarf or a pair of little stockings she must knit me a scarf look what a horrid one ive got the nasty yellow thing it did me a bad turn today and you wore a nice one vasya to introduce me while i had my head in a halter though never mind that now and look here i undertake all the silver i am bound to give you some little presentthat will be an honour that will flatter my vanity my bonuses wont fail me surely you dont suppose they would give them to skorohodov no fear they wont be landed in that persons pocket ill buy you silver spoons brother good knivesnot silver knives but thoroughly good ones and a waistcoat that is a waistcoat for myself i shall be best man of course only now brother you must keep at it you must keep at it i shall stand over you with a stick brother today and tomorrow and all night i shall worry you to work finish make haste and finish brother and then again to spend the evening and then again both of us happy we will go in for loto we will spend the evening thereoh its jolly oh the devil how vexing it is i cant help you i should like to take it and write it all for you why is it our handwriting is not alike yes answered vasya yes i must make haste i think it must be eleven oclock we must make haste to work and saying this vasya who had been all the time alternately smiling and trying to interrupt with some enthusiastic rejoinder the flow of his friends feelings and had in short been showing the most cordial response suddenly subsided sank into silence and almost ran along the street it seemed as though some burdensome idea had suddenly chilled his feverish head he seemed all at once dispirited arkady ivanovitch felt quite uneasy he scarcely got an answer to his hurried questions from vasya who confined himself to a word or two sometimes an irrelevant exclamation why what is the matter with you vasya he cried at last hardly able to keep up with him can you really be so uneasy oh brother thats enough chatter vasya answered with vexation dont be depressed vasyacome come arkady interposed why i have known you write much more in a shorter time whats the matter youve simply a talent for it you can write quickly in an emergency they are not going to lithograph your copy youve plenty of time the only thing is that you are excited now and preoccupied and the work wont go so easily vasya made no reply or muttered something to himself and they both ran home in genuine anxiety vasya sat down to the papers at once arkady ivanovitch was quiet and silent he noiselessly undressed and went to bed keeping his eyes fixed on vasya a sort of panic came over him what is the matter with him he thought to himself looking at vasyas face that grew whiter and whiter at his feverish eyes at the anxiety that was betrayed in every movement he made why his hand is shaking what a stupid why did i not advise him to sleep for a couple of hours till he had slept off his nervous excitement any way vasya had just finished a page he raised his eyes glanced casually at arkady and at once looking down took up his pen again listen vasya arkady ivanovitch began suddenly wouldnt it be best to sleep a little now look you are in a regular fever vasya glanced at arkady with vexation almost with anger and made no answer listen vasya youll make yourself ill vasya at once changed his mind how would it be to have tea arkady he said how so why it will do me good i am not sleepy im not going to bed i am going on writing but now i should like to rest and have a cup of tea and the worst moment will be over firstrate brother vasya delightful just so i was wanting to propose it myself and i cant think why it did not occur to me to do so but i say mavra wont get up she wont wake for anything true thats no matter though cried arkady ivanovitch leaping out of bed i will set the samovar myself it wont be the first time arkady ivanovitch ran to the kitchen and set to work to get the samovar vasya meanwhile went on writing arkady ivanovitch moreover dressed and ran out to the bakers so that vasya might have something to sustain him for the night a quarter of an hour later the samovar was on the table they began drinking tea but conversation flagged vasya still seemed preoccupied tomorrow he said at last as though he had just thought of it i shall have to take my congratulations for the new year you need not go at all oh yes brother i must said vasya why i will sign the visitors book for you everywhere how can you you work tomorrow you must work tonight till five oclock in the morning as i said and then get to bed or else you will be good for nothing tomorrow ill wake you at eight oclock punctually but will it be all right your signing for me said vasya half assenting why what could be better everyone does it i am really afraid why why its all right you know with other people but yulian mastakovitch he has been so kind to me you know arkasha and when he notices its not my own signature notices why what a fellow you are really vasya how could he notice come you know i can imitate your signature awfully well and make just the same flourish to it upon my word i can what nonsense who would notice vasya made no reply but emptied his glass hurriedly then he shook his head doubtfully vasya dear boy ah if only we succeed vasya whats the matter with you you quite frighten me do you know vasya i am not going to bed now i am not going to sleep show me have you a great deal left vasya gave arkady such a look that his heart sank and his tongue failed him vasya what is the matter what are you thinking why do you look like that arkady i really must go tomorrow to wish yulian mastakovitch a happy new year well go then said arkady gazing at him openeyed in uneasy expectation i say vasya do write faster i am advising you for your good i really am how often yulian mastakovitch himself has said that what he likes particularly about your writing is its legibility why it is all that skoroplehin cares for that writing should be good and distinct like a copy so as afterwards to pocket the paper and take it home for his children to copy he cant buy copybooks the blockhead yulian mastakovitch is always saying always insisting legible legible legible what is the matter vasya i really dont know how to talk to you it quite frightens me you crush me with your depression its all right its all right said vasya and he fell back in his chair as though fainting arkady was alarmed will you have some water vasya vasya dont dont said vasya pressing his hand i am all right i only feel sad i cant tell why better talk of something else let me forget it calm yourself for goodness sake calm yourself vasya you will finish it all right on my honour you will and even if you dont finish what will it matter you talk as though it were a crime arkady said vasya looking at his friend with such meaning that arkady was quite frightened for vasya had never been so agitated before if i were alone as i used to be no i dont mean that i keep wanting to tell you as a friend to confide in you but why worry you though you see arkady to some much is given others do a little thing as i do well if gratitude appreciation is expected of you and you cant give it vasya i dont understand you in the least i have never been ungrateful vasya went on softly as though speaking to himself but if i am incapable of expressing all i feel it seems as though it seems arkady as though i am really ungrateful and thats killing me what next what next as though gratitude meant nothing more than your finishing that copy in time just think what you are saying vasya is that the whole expression of gratitude vasya sank into silence at once and looked openeyed at arkady as though his unexpected argument had settled all his doubts he even smiled but the same melancholy expression came back to his face at once arkady taking this smile as a sign that all his uneasiness was over and the look that succeeded it as an indication that he was determined to do better was greatly relieved well brother arkasha you will wake up said vasya keep an eye on me if i fall asleep it will be dreadful ill set to work now arkasha what oh its nothing i only i meant vasya settled himself and said no more arkady got into bed neither of them said one word about their friends the artemyevs perhaps both of them felt that they had been a little to blame and that they ought not to have gone for their jaunt when they did arkady soon fell asleep still worried about vasya to his own surprise he woke up exactly at eight oclock in the morning vasya was asleep in his chair with the pen in his hand pale and exhausted the candle had burnt out mavra was busy getting the samovar ready in the kitchen vasya vasya arkady cried in alarm when did you fall asleep vasya opened his eyes and jumped up from his chair oh he cried i must have fallen asleep he flew to the paperseverything was right all were in order there was not a blot of ink nor spot of grease from the candle on them i think i must have fallen asleep about six oclock said vasya how cold it is in the night let us have tea and i will go on again do you feel better yes yes im all right im all right now a happy new year to you brother vasya and to you too brother the same to you dear boy they embraced each other vasyas chin was quivering and his eyes were moist arkady ivanovitch was silent he felt sad they drank their tea hastily arkady ive made up my mind i am going myself to yulian mastakovitch why he wouldnt notice but my conscience feels ill at ease brother but you know its for his sake you are sitting here its for his sake you are wearing yourself out enough do you know what

contented and happy embrace me vasya ah if only we may brother does mr shumkov live here they heard a childs voice on the stairs yes my dear yes said mavra showing the visitor in whats that what is it cried vasya leaping up from the table and rushing to the entry petinka you good morning i have the honour to wish you a happy new year vassily petrovitch said a pretty boy of ten years old with curly black hair sister sends you her love and so does mamma and sister told me to give you a kiss for her vasya caught the messenger up in the air and printed a long enthusiastic kiss on his lips which were very much like lizankas kiss him arkady he said handing petya to him and without touching the ground the boy was transferred to arkady ivanovitchs powerful and eager arms will you have some breakfast dear thankyou very much we have had it already we got up early today the others have gone to church sister was two hours curling my hair and pomading it washing me and mending my trousers for i tore them yesterday playing with sashka in the street we were snowballing well well well so she dressed me up to come and see you and then pomaded my head and then gave me a regular kissing she said go to vasya wish him a happy new year and ask whether they are happy whether they had a good night and to ask something elseoh yes whether you had finished the work you spoke of yesterday when

vasya i shall get you a locket for that curl arkady ivanovitch said resolutely at last and we are going to have hot veal and tomorrow brains mamma wants to make cakes but we are not going to have millet porridge said the boy after a moments thought to wind up his budget of interesting items oh what a pretty boy cried arkady ivanovitch vasya you are the happiest of mortals the boy finished his tea took from vasya a note a thousand kisses and went out happy and frolicsome as before well brother began arkady ivanovitch highly delighted you see how splendid it all is you see everything is

afterwards come comeof course i know all about it this happiness has upset you the suddenness of it all youve not been yourself since yesterday you have not got over the excitement of yesterday well its settled now try and get over it vasya goodbye goodbye at last the friends parted all the morning arkady ivanovitch was preoccupied and could think of nothing but vasya he knew his weak highly nervous character yes this happiness has upset him i was right there he said to himself upon my word he has made me quite depressed too that man will make a tragedy of anything what a feverish creature oh i must save him i must save him said arkady not noticing that he himself was exaggerating into something serious a slight trouble in reality quite trivial only at eleven oclock he reached the porters lodge of yulian mastakovitchs house to add his modest name to the long list of illustrious persons who had written their names on a sheet of blotted and scribbled paper in the porters lodge what was his surprise when he saw just above his own the signature of vasya shumkov it amazed him whats the matter with him he thought arkady ivanovitch who had just been so buoyant with hope came out feeling upset there was certainly going to be trouble but how and in what form he reached the artemyevs with gloomy forebodings he seemed absentminded from the first and after talking a little with lizanka went away with tears in his eyes he was really anxious about vasya he went home running and on the neva came full tilt upon vasya himself the latter too was uneasy where are you going cried arkady ivanovitch vasya stopped as though he had been caught in a crime oh its nothing brother i wanted to go for a walk you could not stand it and have been to the artemyevs oh vasya vasya why did you go to yulian mastakovitch vasya did not answer but then with a wave of his hand he said arkady i dont know what is the matter with me i come come vasya i know what it is calm yourself youve been excited and overwrought ever since yesterday only think its not much to bear everybodys fond of you everybodys ready to do anything for you your work is getting on all right you will get it done you will certainly get it done i know that you have been imagining something you have had apprehensions about something no its all right its all right do you remember vasya do you remember it was the same with you once before do you remember when you got your promotion in your joy and thankfulness you were so zealous that you spoilt all your work for a week it is just the same with you now yes yes arkady but now it is different it is not that at all how is it different and very likely the work is not urgent at all while you are killing yourself its nothing its nothing i am all right its nothing well come along why are you going home and not to them yes brother how could i have the face to turn up there i have changed my mind it was only that i could not stay on alone without you now you are coming back with me ill sit down to write again let us go they walked along and for some time were silent vasya was in haste why dont you ask me about them said arkady ivanovitch oh yes well arkasha what about them vasya you are not like yourself oh i am all right i am all right tell me everything arkasha said vasya in an imploring voice as though to avoid further explanations arkady ivanovitch sighed he felt utterly at a loss looking at vasya his account of their friends roused vasya he even grew talkative they had dinner together lizankas mother had filled arkady ivanovitchs pockets with little cakes and eating them the friends grew more cheerful after dinner vasya promised to take a nap so as to sit up all night he did in fact lie down in the morning some one whom it was impossible to refuse had invited arkady ivanovitch to tea the friends parted arkady promised to come back as soon as he could by eight oclock if possible the three hours of separation seemed to him like three years at last he got away and rushed back to vasya when he went into the room he found it in darkness vasya was not at home he asked mavra mavra said that he had been writing all the time and had not slept at all then he had paced up and down the room and after that an hour before he had run out saying he would be back in halfanhour and when says he arkady ivanovitch comes in tell him old woman says he mavra told him in conclusion that i have gone out for a walk and he repeated the order three or four times he is at the artemyevs thought arkady ivanovitch and he shook his head a minute later he jumped up with renewed hope he has simply finished he thought thats all it is he couldnt wait but ran off there but no he would have waited for me lets have a peep what he has there he lighted a candle and ran to vasyas writingtable the work had made progress and it looked as though there were not much left to do arkady ivanovitch was about to investigate further when vasya himself walked in oh you are here he cried with a start of dismay arkady ivanovitch was silent he was afraid to question vasya the latter dropped his eyes and remained silent too as he began sorting the papers at last their eyes met the look in vasyas was so beseeching imploring and broken that arkady shuddered when he saw it his heart quivered and was full vasya my dear boy what is it whats wrong he cried rushing to him and squeezing him in his arms explain to me i dont understand you and your depression what is the matter with you my poor tormented boy what is it tell me all about it without hiding anything it cant be only this vasya held him tight and could say nothing he could scarcely breathe dont vasya dont well if you dont finish it what then i dont understand you tell me your trouble you see it is for your sake i oh dear oh dear he said walking up and down the room and clutching at everything he came across as though seeking at once some remedy for vasya i will go to yulian mastakovitch instead of you tomorrow i will ask himentreat himto let you have another day i will explain it all to him anything if it worries you so god forbid cried vasya and turned as white as the wall he could scarcely stand on his feet vasya vasya vasya pulled himself together his lips were quivering he tried to say something but could only convulsively squeeze arkadys hand in silence his hand was cold arkady stood facing him full of anxious and miserable suspense vasya raised his eyes again vasya god bless you vasya you wring my heart my dear boy my friend tears gushed from vasyas eyes he flung himself on arkadys bosom i have deceived you arkady he said i have deceived you forgive me forgive me i have been faithless to your friendship what is it vasya what is the matter asked arkady in real alarm look and with a gesture of despair vasya tossed out of the drawer on to the table six thick manuscripts similar to the one he had copied whats this what i have to get through by the day after tomorrow i havent done a quarter dont ask me dont ask me how it has happened vasya went on speaking at once of what was distressing him so terribly arkady dear friend i dont know myself what came over me i feel as though i were coming out of a dream i have wasted three weeks doing nothing i kept i kept going to see her my heart was aching i was tormented by the uncertainty i could not write i did not even think about it only now when happiness is at hand for me i have come to my senses vasya began arkady ivanovitch resolutely vasya i will save you i understand it all its a serious matter i will save you listen listen to me i will go to yulian mastakovitch tomorrow dont shake your head no listen i will tell him exactly how it has all been let me do that i will explain to him i will go into everything i will tell him how crushed you are how you are worrying yourself do you know that you are killing me now vasya brought out turning cold with horror arkady ivanovitch turned pale but at once controlling himself laughed is that all is that all he said upon my word vasya upon my word arent you ashamed come listen i see that i am grieving you you see i understand you i know what is passing in your heart why we have been living together for five years thank god you are such a kind softhearted fellow but weak unpardonably weak why even lizaveta mikalovna has noticed it and you are a dreamer and thats a bad thing too you may go from bad to worse brother i tell you i know what you want you would like yulian mastakovitch for instance to be beside himself and maybe to give a ball too from joy because you are going to get married stop stop you are frowning you see that at one word from me you are offended on yulian mastakovitchs account ill let him alone you know i respect him just as much as you do but argue as you may you cant prevent my thinking that you would like there to be no one unhappy in the whole world when you are getting married yes brother you must admit that you would like me for instance your best friend to come in for a fortune of a hundred thousand all of a sudden you would like all the enemies in the world to be suddenly for no rhyme or reason reconciled so that in their joy they might all embrace one another in the middle of the street and then perhaps come here to call on you vasya my dear boy i am not laughing it is true youve said as much to me long ago in different ways because you are happy you want every one absolutely every one to become happy at once it hurts you and troubles you to be happy alone and so you want at once to do your utmost to be worthy of that happiness and maybe to do some great deed to satisfy your conscience oh i understand how ready you are to distress yourself for having suddenly been remiss just where you ought to have shown your zeal your capacity well maybe your gratitude as you say it is very bitter for you to think that yulian mastakovitch may frown and even be angry when he sees that you have not justified the expectations he had of you it hurts you to think that you may hear reproaches from the man you look upon as your benefactorand at such a moment when your heart is full of joy and you dont know on whom to lavish your gratitude isnt that true it is isnt it arkady ivanovitch whose voice was trembling paused and drew a deep breath vasya looked affectionately at his friend a smile passed over his lips his face even lighted up as though with a gleam of hope well listen then arkady ivanovitch began again growing more hopeful theres no necessity that you should forfeit yulian mastakovitchs favour is there dear boy is there any question of it and since it is so said arkady jumping up i shall sacrifice myself for you i am going tomorrow to yulian mastakovitch and dont oppose me you magnify your failure to a crime vasya yulian mastakovitch is magnanimous and merciful and what is more he is not like you he will listen to you and me and get us out of our trouble brother vasya well are you calmer vasya pressed his friends hands with tears in his eyes hush hush arkady he said the thing is settled i havent finished so very well if i havent finished i havent finished and theres no need for you to go i will tell him all about it i will go myself i am calmer now i am perfectly calm only you mustnt go but listen vasya my dear boy arkady ivanovitch cried joyfully i judged from what you said i am glad that you have thought better of things and have recovered yourself but whatever may befall you whatever happens i am with you remember that i see that it worries you to think of my speaking to yulian mastakovitchand i wont say a word not a word you shall tell him yourself you see you shall go tomorrow oh no you had better not go youll go on writing here you see and ill find out about this work whether it is very urgent or not whether it must be done by the time or not and if you dont finish it in time what will come of it then i will run back to you do you see do you see there is still hope suppose the work is not urgentit may be all right yulian mastakovitch may not remember then all is saved vasya shook his head doubtfully but his grateful eyes never left his friends face come thats enough i am so weak so tired he said sighing i dont want to think about it let us talk of something else i wont write either now do you know ill only finish two short pages just to get to the end of a passage listen i have long wanted to ask you how is it you know me so well tears dropped from vasyas eyes on arkadys hand if you knew vasya how fond i am of you you would not ask thatyes yes yes arkady i dont know that because i dont know why you are so fond of me yes arkady do you know even your love has been killing me do you know ever so many times particularly when i am thinking of you in bed for i always think of you when i am falling asleep i shed tears and my heart throbs at the thought at the thought well at the thought that you are so fond of me while i can do nothing to relieve my heart can do nothing to repay you you see vasya you see what a fellow you are why how upset you are now said arkady whose heart ached at that moment and who remembered the scene in the street the day before nonsense you want me to be calm but i never have been so calm and happy do you know listen i want to tell you all about it but i am afraid of wounding you you keep scolding me and being vexed and i am afraid see how i am trembling now i dont know why you see this is what i want to say i feel as though i had never known myself beforeyes yes i only began to understand other people too yesterday i did not feel or appreciate things fully brother my heart was hard listen how has it happened that i have never done good to any one any one in the world because i couldnti am not even pleasant to look at but everybody does me good you to begin with do you suppose i dont see that only i said nothing only i said nothing hush vasya oh arkasha its all right vasya interrupted hardly able to articulate for tears i talked to you yesterday about yulian mastakovitch and you know yourself how stern and severe he is even you have come in for a reprimand from him yet he deigned to jest with me yesterday to show his affection and kindheartedness which he prudently conceals from every one come vasya that only shows you deserve your good fortune oh arkasha how i longed to finish all this no i shall ruin my good luck i feel that oh no not through that vasya added seeing that arkady glanced at the heap of urgent work lying on the table thats nothing thats only paper covered with writing its nonsense that matters settled i went to see them today arkasha i did not go in i felt depressed and sad i simply stood at the door she was playing the piano i listened you see arkady he went on dropping his voice i did not dare to go in i say vasyawhat is the matter with you you look at one so strangely oh its nothing i feel a little sick my legs are trembling its because i sat up last night yes everything looks green before my eyes its here here he pointed to his heart he fainted when he came to himself arkady tried to take forcible measures he tried to compel him to go to bed nothing would induce vasya to consent he shed tears wrung his hands wanted to write was absolutely set on finishing his two pages to avoid exciting him arkady let him sit down to the work do you know said vasya as he settled himself in his place an idea has occurred to me there is hope he smiled to arkady and his pale face lighted up with a gleam of hope i will take him what is done the day after tomorrow about the rest i will tell a lie i will say it has been burnt that it has been sopped in water that i have lost it that in fact i have not finished it i cannot lie i will explain do you know what ill explain to him all about it i will tell him how it was that i could not ill tell him about my love he has got married himself just lately hell understand me i will do it all of course respectfully quietly he will see my tears and be touched by them yes of course you must go you must go and explain to him but theres no need of tears tears for what really vasya you quite scare me yes ill go ill go but now let me write let me write arkasha i am not interfering with any one let me write arkady flung himself on the bed he had no confidence in vasya no confidence at all vasya was capable of anything but to ask forgiveness for what how that was not the point the point was that vasya had not carried out his obligations that vasya felt guilty in his own eyes felt that he was ungrateful to destiny that vasya was crushed overwhelmed by happiness and thought himself unworthy of it that in fact he was simply trying to find an excuse to go off his head on that point and that he had not recovered from the unexpectedness of what had happened the day before thats what it is thought arkady ivanovitch i must save him i must reconcile him to himself he will be his own ruin he thought and thought and resolved to go at once next day to yulian mastakovitch and to tell him all about it vasya was sitting writing arkady ivanovitch worn out lay down to think things over again and only woke at daybreak damnation again he cried looking at vasya the latter was still sitting writing arkady rushed up to him seized him and forcibly put him to bed vasya was smiling his eyes were closing with sleep he could hardly speak i wanted to go to bed he said do you know arkady i have an idea i shall finish i made my pen go faster i could not have sat at it any longer wake me at eight oclock without finishing his sentence he dropped asleep and slept like the dead mavra said arkady ivanovitch to mavra who came in with the tea he asked to be waked in an hour dont wake him on any account let him sleep ten hours if he can do you understand i understand sir dont get the dinner dont bring in the wood dont make a noise or it will be the worse for you if he asks for me tell him i have gone to the officedo you understand i understand bless you sir let him sleep and welcome i am glad my gentlemen should sleep well and i take good care of their things and about that cup that was broken and you blamed me your honour it wasnt me it was poor pussy broke it i ought to have kept an eye on her ssh you confounded thing i said hush be quiet be quiet arkady ivanovitch followed mavra out into the kitchen asked for the key and locked her up there then he went to the office on the way he considered how he could present himself before yulian mastakovitch and whether it would be appropriate and not impertinent he went into the office timidly and timidly inquired whether his excellency were there receiving the answer that he was not and would not be arkady ivanovitch instantly thought of going to his flat but reflected very prudently that if yulian mastakovitch had not come to the office he would certainly be busy at home he remained the hours seemed to him endless indirectly he inquired about the work entrusted to shumkov but no one knew anything about this all that was known was that yulian mastakovitch did employ him on special jobs but what they wereno one could say at last it struck three oclock and arkady ivanovitch rushed out eager to get home in the vestibule he was met by a clerk who told him that vassily petrovitch shumkov had come about one oclock and asked the clerk added whether you were here and whether yulian mastakovitch had been here hearing this arkady ivanovitch took a sledge and hastened home beside himself with alarm shumkov was at home he was walking about the room in violent excitement glancing at arkady ivanovitch he immediately controlled himself reflected and hastened to conceal his emotion he sat down to his papers without a word he seemed to avoid his friends questions seemed to be bothered by them to be pondering to himself on some plan and deciding to conceal his decision because he could not reckon further on his friends affection this struck arkady and his heart ached with a poignant and oppressive pain he sat on the bed and began turning over the leaves of some book the only one he had in his possession keeping his eye on poor vasya but vasya remained obstinately silent writing and not raising his head so passed several hours and arkadys misery reached an extreme point at last at eleven oclock vasya lifted his head and looked with a fixed vacant stare at arkady arkady waited two or three minutes passed vasya did not speak vasya cried arkady vasya made no answer vasya he repeated jumping up from the bed vasya what is the matter with you what is it he cried running up to him vasya raised his eyes and again looked at him with the same vacant fixed stare hes in a trance thought arkady trembling all over with fear he seized a bottle of water raised vasya poured some water on his head moistened his temples rubbed his hands in his ownand vasya came to himself vasya vasya cried arkady unable to restrain his tears vasya save yourself rouse yourself rouse yourself he could say no more but held him tight in his arms a look as of some oppressive sensation passed over vasyas face he rubbed his forehead and clutched at his head as though he were afraid it would burst i dont know what is the matter with me he added at last i feel torn to pieces come its all right its all right give over arkady dont grieve he repeated looking at him with sad exhausted eyes why be so anxious come you you comforting me cried arkady whose heart was torn vasya he said at last lie down and have a little nap wont you dont wear yourself out for nothing youll set to work better afterwards yes yes said vasya by all means ill lie down very good yes you see i meant to finish but now ive changed my mind yes and arkady led him to the bed listen vasya he said firmly we must settle this matter finally tell me what were you thinking about oh said vasya with a flourish of his weak hand turning over on the other side come vasya come make up your mind i dont want to hurt you i cant be silent any longer you wont sleep till youve made up your mind i know as you like as you like vasya repeated enigmatically he will give in thought arkady ivanovitch attend to me vasya he said remember what i say and i will save you tomorrow tomorrow i will decide your fate what am i saying your fate you have so frightened me vasya that i am using your own words fate indeed its simply nonsense rubbish you dont want to lose yulian mastakovitchs favouraffection if you like no and you wont lose it you will see i arkady ivanovitch would have said more but vasya interrupted him he sat up in bed put both arms round arkady ivanovitchs neck and kissed him enough he said in a weak voice enough say no more about that and again he turned his face to the wall my goodness thought arkady my goodness what is the matter with him he is utterly lost what has he in his mind he will be his own undoing arkady looked at him in despair if he were to fall ill thought arkady perhaps it would be better his trouble would pass off with illness and that might be the best way of settling the whole business but what nonsense i am talking oh my god meanwhile vasya seemed to be asleep arkady ivanovitch was relieved a good sign he thought he made up his mind to sit beside him all night but vasya was restless he kept twitching and tossing about on the bed and opening his eyes for an instant at last exhaustion got the upper hand he slept like the dead it was about two oclock in the morning arkady ivanovitch began to doze in the chair with his elbow on the table he had a strange and agitated dream he kept fancying that he was not asleep and that vasya was still lying on the bed but strange to say he fancied that vasya was pretending that he was deceiving him that he was getting up stealthily watching him out of the corner of his eye and was stealing up to the writing table arkady felt a scalding pain at his heart he felt vexed and sad and oppressed to see vasya not trusting him hiding and concealing himself from him he tried to catch hold of him to call out to carry him to the bed then vasya kept shrieking in his arms and he laid on the bed a lifeless corpse he opened his eyes and woke up vasya was sitting before him at the table writing hardly able to believe his senses arkady glanced at the bed vasya was not there arkady jumped up in a panic still under the influence of his dream vasya did not stir he went on writing all at once arkady noticed with horror that vasya was moving a dry pen over the paper was turning over perfectly blank pages and hurrying hurrying to fill up the paper as though he were doing his work in a most thorough and efficient way no this is not a trance thought arkady ivanovitch and he trembled all over vasya vasya speak to me he cried clutching him by the shoulder but vasya did not speak he went on as before scribbling with a dry pen over the paper at last i have made the pen go faster he said without looking up at arkady arkady seized his hand and snatched away the pen a moan broke from vasya he dropped his hand and raised his eyes to arkady then with an air of misery and exhaustion he passed his hand over his forehead as though he wanted to shake off some leaden weight that was pressing upon his whole being and slowly as though lost in thought he let his head sink on his breast vasya vasya cried arkady in despair vasya a minute later vasya looked at him tears stood in his large blue eyes and his pale mild face wore a look of infinite suffering he whispered something what what is it cried arkady bending down to him what for why are they doing it to me whispered vasya what for what have i done vasya what is it what are you afraid of what is it cried arkady wringing his hands in despair why are they sending me for a soldier said vasya looking his friend straight in the face why is it what have i done arkadys hair stood on end with horror he refused to believe his ears he stood over him half dead a minute later he pulled himself together its nothing its only for the minute he said to himself with pale face and blue quivering lips and he hastened to put on his outdoor things he meant to run straight for a doctor all at once vasya called to him arkady rushed to him and clasped him in his arms like a mother whose child is being torn from her arkady arkady dont tell any one dont tell any one do you hear it is my trouble i must bear it alone what is itwhat is it rouse yourself vasya rouse yourself vasya sighed and slow tears trickled down his cheeks why kill her how is she to blame he muttered in an agonized heartrending voice the sin is mine the sin is mine he was silent for a moment farewell my love farewell my love he whispered shaking his luckless head arkady started pulled himself together and would have rushed for the doctor let us go it is time cried vasya carried away by arkadys last movement let us go brother let us go i am ready you lead the way he paused and looked at arkady with a downcast and mistrustful face vasya for goodness sake dont follow me wait for me here i will come back to you directly directly said arkady ivanovitch losing his head and snatching up his cap to run for a doctor vasya sat down at once he was quiet and docile but there was a gleam of some desperate resolution in his eye arkady turned back snatched up from the table an open penknife looked at the poor fellow for the last time and ran out of the flat it was eight oclock it had been broad daylight for some time in the room he found no one he was running about for a full hour all the doctors whose addresses he had got from the house porter when he inquired of the latter whether there were no doctor living in the building had gone out either to their work or on their private affairs there was one who saw patients this one questioned at length and in detail the servant who announced that nefedevitch had called asking him who it was from whom he came what was the matter and concluded by saying that he could not go that he had a great deal to do and that patients of that kind ought to be taken to a hospital then arkady exhausted agitated and utterly taken aback by this turn of affairs cursed all the doctors on earth and rushed home in the utmost alarm about vasya he ran into the flat mavra as though there were nothing the matter went on scrubbing the floor breaking up wood and preparing to light the stove he went into the room there was no trace of vasya he had gone out which way where where will the poor fellow be off to thought arkady frozen with terror he began questioning mavra she knew nothing had neither seen nor heard him go out god bless him nefedevitch rushed off to the artemyevs it occurred to him for some reason that he must be there it was ten oclock by the time he arrived they did not expect him knew nothing and had heard nothing he stood before them frightened distressed and asked where was vasya the mothers legs gave way under her she sank back on the sofa lizanka trembling with alarm began asking what had happened what could he say arkady ivanovitch got out of it as best he could invented some tale which of course was not believed and fled leaving them distressed and anxious he flew to his department that he might not be too late there and he let them know that steps might be taken at once on the way it occurred to him that vasya would be at yulian mastakovitchs that was more likely than anything arkady had thought of that first of all even before the artemyevs as he drove by his excellencys door he thought of stopping but at once told the driver to go straight on he made up his mind to try and find out whether anything had happened at the office and if he were not there to go to his excellency ostensibly to report on vasya some one must be informed of it as soon as he got into the waitingroom he was surrounded by fellowclerks for the most part young men of his own standing in the service with one voice they began asking him what had happened to vasya at the same time they all told him that vasya had gone out of his mind and thought that he was to be sent for a soldier as a punishment for having neglected his work arkady ivanovitch answering them in all directions or rather avoiding giving a direct answer to any one rushed into the inner room on the way he learned that vasya was in yulian mastakovitchs private room that every one had been there and that esper ivanovitch had gone in there too he was stopped on the way one of the senior clerks asked him who he was and what he wanted without distinguishing the person he said something about vasya and went straight into the room he heard yulian mastakovitchs voice from within where are you going some one asked him at the very door arkady ivanovitch was almost in despair he was on the point of turning back but through the open door he saw his poor vasya he pushed the door and squeezed his way into the room every one seemed to be in confusion and perplexity because yulian mastakovitch was apparently much chagrined all the more important personages were standing about him talking and coming to no decision at a little distance stood vasya arkadys heart sank when he looked at him vasya was standing pale with his head up stiffly erect like a recruit before a new officer with his feet together and his hands held rigidly at his sides he was looking yulian mastakovitch straight in the face arkady was noticed at once and some one who knew that they lodged together mentioned the fact to his excellency arkady was led up to him he tried to make some answer to the questions put to him glanced at yulian mastakovitch and seeing on his face a look of genuine compassion began trembling and sobbing like a child he even did more he snatched his excellencys hand and held it to his eyes wetting it with his tears so that yulian mastakovitch was obliged to draw it hastily away and waving it in the air said come my dear fellow come i see you have a good heart arkady sobbed and turned an imploring look on every one it seemed to him that they were all brothers of his dear vasya that they were all worried and weeping about him how how has it happened how has it happened asked yulian mastakovitch what has sent him out of his mind gragragratitude was all arkady ivanovitch could articulate every one heard his answer with amazement and it seemed strange and incredible to every one that a man could go out of his mind from gratitude arkady explained as best he could good heavens what a pity said yulian mastakovitch at last and the work entrusted to him was not important and not urgent in the least it was not worth while for a man to kill himself over it well take him away at this point yulian mastakovitch turned to arkady ivanovitch again and began questioning him once more he begs he said pointing to vasya that some girl should not be told of this who is shehis betrothed i suppose arkady began to explain meanwhile vasya seemed to be thinking of something as though he were straining his memory to the utmost to recall some important necessary matter which was particularly wanted at this moment from time to time he looked round with a distressed face as though hoping some one would remind him of what he had forgotten he fastened his eyes on arkady all of a sudden there was a gleam of hope in his eyes he moved with the left leg forward took three steps as smartly as he could clicking with his right boot as soldiers do when they move forward at the call from their officer every one was waiting to see what would happen i have a physical defect and am small and weak and i am not fit for military service your excellency he said abruptly at that every one in the room felt a pang at his heart and firm as was yulian mastakovitchs character tears trickled from his eyes take him away he said with a wave of his hands present said vasya in an undertone he wheeled round to the left and marched out of the room all who were interested in his fate followed him out arkady pushed his way out behind the others they made vasya sit down in the waitingroom till the carriage came which had been ordered to take him to the hospital he sat down in silence and seemed in great anxiety he nodded to any one he recognized as though saying goodbye he looked round towards the door every minute and prepared himself to set off when he should be told it was time people crowded in a close circle round him they were all shaking their heads and lamenting many of them were much impressed by his story which had suddenly become known some discussed his illness while others expressed their pity and high opinion of vasya saying that he was such a quiet modest young man that he had been so promising people described what efforts he had made to learn how eager he was for knowledge how he had worked to educate himself he had risen by his own efforts from a humble position some one observed they spoke with emotion of his excellencys affection for him some of them fell to explaining why vasya was possessed by the idea that he was being sent for a soldier because he had not finished his work they said that the poor fellow had so lately belonged to the class liable for military service and had only received his first grade through the good offices of yulian mastakovitch who had had the cleverness to discover his talent his docility and the rare mildness of his disposition in fact there was a great number of views and theories a very short fellowclerk of vasyas was conspicuous as being particularly distressed he was not very young probably about thirty he was pale as a sheet trembling all over and smiling queerly perhaps because any scandalous affair or terrible scene both frightens and at the same time somewhat rejoices the outside spectator he kept running round the circle that surrounded vasya and as he was so short stood on tiptoe and caught at the button of every onethat is of those with whom he felt entitled to take such a libertyand kept saying that he knew how it had all happened that it was not so simple but a very important matter that it couldnt be left without further inquiry then stood on tiptoe again whispered in some ones ear nodded his head again two or three times and ran round again at last everything was over the porter made his appearance and an attendant from the hospital went up to vasya and told him it was time to start vasya jumped up in a flutter and went with them looking about him he was looking about for some one vasya vasya cried arkady ivanovitch sobbing vasya stopped and arkady squeezed his way up to him they flung themselves into each others arms in a last bitter embrace it was sad to see them what monstrous calamity was wringing the tears from their eyes what were they weeping for what was their trouble why did they not understand one another here here take it take care of it said shumkov thrusting a paper of some kind into arkadys hand they will take it away from me bring it me later on bring it take care of it vasya could not finish they called to him he ran hurriedly downstairs nodding to every one saying goodbye to every one there was despair in his face at last he was put in the carriage and taken away arkady made haste to open the paper it was lizas curl of black hair from which vasya had never parted hot tears gushed from arkadys eyes oh poor liza when office hours were over he went to the artemyevs there is no need to describe what happened there even petya little petya though he could not quite understand what had happened to dear vasya went into a corner hid his face in his little hands and sobbed in the fullness of his childish heart it was quite dusk when arkady returned home when he reached the neva he stood still for a minute and turned a keen glance up the river into the smoky frozen thickness of the distance which was suddenly flushed crimson with the last purple and bloodred glow of sunset still smouldering on the misty horizon night lay over the city and the wide plain of the neva swollen with frozen snow was shining in the last gleams of the sun with myriads of sparks of gleaming hoar frost there was a frost of twenty degrees a cloud of frozen steam hung about the overdriven horses and the hurrying people the condensed atmosphere quivered at the slightest sound and from all the roofs on both sides of the river columns of smoke rose up like giants and floated across the cold sky intertwining and untwining as they went so that it seemed new buildings were rising up above the old a new town was taking shape in the air it seemed as if all that world with all its inhabitants strong and weak with all their habitations the refuges of the poor or the gilded palaces for the comfort of the powerful of this world was at that twilight hour like a fantastic vision of fairyland like a dream which in its turn would vanish and pass away like vapour into the dark blue sky a strange thought came to poor vasyas forlorn friend he started and his heart seemed at that instant flooded with a hot rush of blood kindled by a powerful overwhelming sensation he had never known before he seemed only now to understand all the trouble and to know why his poor vasya had gone out of his mind unable to bear his happiness his lips twitched his eyes lighted up he turned pale and as it were had a clear vision into something new he became gloomy and depressed and lost all his gaiety his old lodging grew hateful to himhe took a new room he did not care to visit the artemyevs and indeed he could not two years later he met lizanka in church she was by then married beside her walked a wet nurse with a tiny baby they greeted each other and for a long time avoided all mention of the past liza said that thank god she was happy that she was not badly off that her husband was a kind man and that she was fond of him but suddenly in the middle of a sentence her eyes filled with tears her voice failed she turned away and bowed down to the church pavement to hide her grief a christmas tree and a wedding a story the other day i saw a wedding but no i had better tell you about the christmas tree the wedding was nice i liked it very much but the other incident was better i dont know how it was that looking at that wedding i thought of that christmas tree this was what happened just five years ago on new years eve i was invited to a childrens party the giver of the party was a wellknown and businesslike personage with connections with a large circle of acquaintances and a good many schemes on hand so that it may be supposed that this party was an excuse for getting the parents together and discussing various interesting matters in an innocent casual way i was an outsider i had no interesting matter to contribute and so i spent the evening rather independently there was another gentleman present who was i fancied of no special rank or family and who like me had simply turned up at this family festivity he was the first to catch my eye he was a tall lanky man very grave and very correctly dressed but one could see that he was in no mood for merrymaking and family festivity whenever he withdrew into a corner he left off smiling and knitted his bushy black brows he had not a single acquaintance in the party except his host one could see that he was fearfully bored but that he was valiantly keeping up the part of a man perfectly happy and enjoying himself i learned afterwards that this was a gentleman from the provinces who had a critical and perplexing piece of business in petersburg who had brought a letter of introduction to our host for whom our host was by no means con amore using his interest and whom he had invited out of civility to his childrens party he did not play cards cigars were not offered him every one avoided entering into conversation with him most likely recognizing the bird from its feathers and so my gentleman was forced to sit the whole evening stroking his whiskers simply to have something to do with his hands his whiskers were certainly very fine but he stroked them so zealously that looking at him one might have supposed that the whiskers were created first and the gentleman only attached to them in order to stroke them in addition to this individual who assisted in this way at our hosts family festivity he had five fat wellfed boys i was attracted too by another gentleman but he was quite of a different sort he was a personage he was called yulian mastakovitch from the first glance one could see that he was an honoured guest and stood in the same relation to our host as our host stood in relation to the gentleman who was stroking his whiskers our host and hostess said no end of polite things to him waited on him hand and foot pressed him to drink flattered him brought their visitors up to be introduced to him but did not take him to be introduced to any one else i noticed that tears glistened in our hosts eyes when he remarked about the party that he had rarely spent an evening so agreeably i felt as it were frightened in the presence of such a personage and so after admiring the children i went away into a little parlour which was quite empty and sat down in an arbour of flowers which filled up almost half the room the children were all incredibly sweet and resolutely refused to model themselves on the grownups regardless of all the admonitions of their governesses and mammas they stripped the christmas tree to the last sweetmeat in the twinkling of an eye and had succeeded in breaking half the playthings before they knew what was destined for which particularly charming was a blackeyed curlyheaded boy who kept trying to shoot me with his wooden gun but my attention was still more attracted by his sister a girl of eleven quiet dreamy pale with big prominent dreamy eyes exquisite as a little cupid the children hurt her feelings in some way and so she came away from them to the same empty parlour in which i was sitting and played with her doll in the corner the visitors respectfully pointed out her father a wealthy contractor and some one whispered that three hundred thousand roubles were already set aside for her dowry i turned round to glance at the group who were interested in such a circumstance and my eye fell on yulian mastakovitch who with his hands behind his back and his head on one side was listening with the greatest attention to these gentlemens idle gossip afterwards i could not help admiring the discrimination of the host and hostess in the distribution of the childrens presents the little girl who had already a portion of three hundred thousand roubles received the costliest doll then followed presents diminishing in value in accordance with the rank of the parents of these happy children finally the child of lowest degree a thin freckled redhaired little boy of ten got nothing but a book of stories about the marvels of nature and tears of devotion etc without pictures or even woodcuts he was the son of a poor widow the governess of the children of the house an oppressed and scared little boy he was dressed in a short jacket of inferior nankin after receiving his book he walked round the other toys for a long time he longed to play with the other children but did not dare it was evident that he already felt and understood his position i love watching children their first independent approaches to life are extremely interesting i noticed that the redhaired boy was so fascinated by the costly toys of the other children especially by a theatre in which he certainly longed to take some part that he made up his mind to sacrifice his dignity he smiled and began playing with the other children he gave away his apple to a fatfaced little boy who had a mass of goodies tied up in a pockethandkerchief already and even brought himself to carry another boy on his back simply not to be turned away from the theatre but an insolent youth gave him a heavy thump a minute later the child did not dare to cry then the governess his mother made her appearance and told him not to interfere with the other childrens playing the boy went away to the same room in which was the little girl she let him join her and the two set to work very eagerly dressing the expensive doll i had been sitting more than half an hour in the ivy arbour listening to the little prattle of the redhaired boy and the beauty with the dowry of three hundred thousand who was nursing her doll when yulian mastakovitch suddenly walked into the room he had taken advantage of the general commotion following a quarrel among the children to step out of the drawingroom i had noticed him a moment before talking very cordially to the future heiresss papa whose acquaintance he had just made of the superiority of one branch of the service over another now he stood in hesitation and seemed to be reckoning something on his fingers three hundred three hundred he was whispering eleven twelve thirteen and so on sixteenfive years supposing it is at four per centfive times twelve is sixty yes to that sixty well in five years we may assume it will be four hundred yes but he wont stick to four per cent the rascal he can get eight or ten well five hundred let us say five hundred at least thats certain well say a little more for frills hm his hesitation was at an end he blew his nose and was on the point of going out of the room when he suddenly glanced at the little girl and stopped short he did not see me behind the pots of greenery it seemed to me that he was greatly excited either his calculations had affected his imagination or something else for he rubbed his hands and could hardly stand still this excitement reached its utmost limit when he stopped and bent another resolute glance at the future heiress he was about to move forward but first looked round then moving on tiptoe as though he felt guilty he advanced towards the children he approached with a little smile bent down and kissed her on the head the child not expecting this attack uttered a cry of alarm what are you doing here sweet child he asked in a whisper looking round and patting the girls cheek we are playing ah with him yulian mastakovitch looked askance at the boy you had better go into the drawingroom my dear he said to him the boy looked at him openeyed and did not utter a word yulian mastakovitch looked round him again and again bent down to the little girl and what is this youve gota dolly dear child he asked yes a dolly answered the child frowning and a little shy a dolly and do you know dear child what your dolly is made of i dont know the child answered in a whisper hanging her head its made of rags darling you had better go into the drawingroom to your playmates boy said yulian mastakovitch looking sternly at the boy the boy and girl frowned and clutched at each other they did not want to be separated and do you know why they gave you that doll asked yulian mastakovitch dropping his voice to a softer and softer tone i dont know because you have been a sweet and wellbehaved child all the week at this point yulian mastakovitch more excited than ever speaking in most dulcet tones asked at last in a hardly audible voice choked with emotion and impatience and will you love me dear little girl when i come and see your papa and mamma saying this yulian mastakovitch tried once more to kiss the dear little girl but the redhaired boy seeing that the little girl was on the point of tears clutched her hand and began whimpering from sympathy for her yulian mastakovitch was angry in earnest go away go away from here go away he said to the boy go into the drawingroom go in there to your playmates no he neednt he neednt you go away said the little girl leave him alone leave him alone she said almost crying some one made a sound at the door yulian mastakovitch instantly raised his majestic person and took alarm but the redhaired boy was even more alarmed than yulian mastakovitch he abandoned the little girl and slinking along by the wall stole out of the parlour into the diningroom to avoid arousing suspicion yulian mastakovitch too went into the diningroom he was as red as a lobster and glancing into the lookingglass seemed to be ashamed at himself he was perhaps vexed with himself for his impetuosity and hastiness possibly he was at first so much impressed by his calculations so inspired and fascinated by them that in spite of his seriousness and dignity he made up his mind to behave like a boy and directly approach the object of his attentions even though she could not be really the object of his attentions for another five years at least i followed the estimable gentleman into the diningroom and there beheld a strange spectacle yulian mastakovitch flushed with vexation and anger was frightening the redhaired boy who retreating from him did not know where to run in his terror go away what are you doing here go away you scamp are you after the fruit here eh get along you naughty boy get along you sniveller to your playmates the panicstricken boy in his desperation tried creeping under the table then his persecutor in a fury took out his large batiste handkerchief and began flicking it under the table at the child who kept perfectly quiet it must be observed that yulian mastakovitch was a little inclined to be fat he was a sleek redfaced solidly built man paunchy with thick legs what is called a fine figure of a man round as a nut he was perspiring breathless and fearfully flushed at last he was almost rigid so great was his indignation and perhapswho knowshis jealousy i burst into loud laughter yulian mastakovitch turned round and in spite of all his consequence was overcome with confusion at that moment from the opposite door our host came in the boy crept out from under the table and wiped his elbows and his knees yulian mastakovitch hastened to put to his nose the handkerchief which he was holding in his hand by one end our host looked at the three of us in some perplexity but as a man who knew something of life and looked at it from a serious point of view he at once availed himself of the chance of catching his visitor by himself here this is the boy he said pointing to the redhaired boy for whom i had the honour to solicit your influence ah said yulian mastakovitch who had hardly quite recovered himself the son of my childrens governess said our host in a tone of a petitioner a poor woman the widow of an honest civil servant and therefore and therefore yulian mastakovitch if it were possible oh no no yulian mastakovitch made haste to answer no excuse me filip alexyevitch its quite impossible ive made inquiries theres no vacancy and if there were there are twenty applicants who have far more claim than he i am very sorry very sorry what a pity said our host he is a quiet wellbehaved boy a great rascal as i notice answered yulian mastakovitch with a nervous twist of his lip get along boy why are you standing there go to your playmates he said addressing the child at that point he could not contain himself and glanced at me out of one eye i too could not contain myself and laughed straight in his face yulian mastakovitch turned away at once and in a voice calculated to reach my ear asked who was that strange young man they whispered together and walked out of the room i saw yulian mastakovitch afterwards shaking his head incredulously as our host talked to him after laughing to my hearts content i returned to the drawingroom there the great man surrounded by fathers and mothers of families including the host and hostess was saying something very warmly to a lady to whom he had just been introduced the lady was holding by the hand the little girl with whom yulian mastakovitch had had the scene in the parlour a little while before now he was launching into praises and raptures over the beauty the talents the grace and the charming manners of the charming child he was unmistakably making up to the mamma the mother listened to him almost with tears of delight the fathers lips were smiling our host was delighted at the general satisfaction all the guests in fact were sympathetically gratified even the childrens games were checked that they might not hinder the conversation the whole atmosphere was saturated with reverence i heard afterwards the mamma of the interesting child deeply touched beg yulian mastakovitch in carefully chosen phrases to do her the special honour of bestowing upon them the precious gift of his acquaintance and heard with what unaffected delight yulian mastakovitch accepted the invitation and how afterwards the guests dispersing in different directions moving away with the greatest propriety poured out to one another the most touchingly flattering comments upon the contractor his wife his little girl and above all upon yulian mastakovitch is that gentleman married i asked almost aloud of one of my acquaintances who was standing nearest to yulian mastakovitch yulian mastakovitch flung a searching and vindictive glance at me no answered my acquaintance chagrined to the bottom of his heart by the awkwardness of which i had intentionally been guilty i passed lately by a certain church i was struck by the crowd of people in carriages i heard people talking of the wedding it was a cloudy day it was beginning to sleet i made my way through the crowd at the door and saw the bridegroom he was a sleek wellfed round paunchy man very gorgeously dressed up he was running fussily about giving orders at last the news passed through the crowd that the bride was coming i squeezed my way through the crowd and saw a marvellous beauty who could scarcely have reached her first season but the beauty was pale and melancholy she looked preoccupied i even fancied that her eyes were red with recent weeping the classic severity of every feature of her face gave a certain dignity and seriousness to her beauty but through that sternness and dignity through that melancholy could be seen the look of childish innocence something indescribably nave fluid youthful which seemed mutely begging for mercy people were saying that she was only just sixteen glancing attentively at the bridegroom i suddenly recognized him as yulian mastakovitch whom i had not seen for five years i looked at her my god i began to squeeze my way as quickly as i could out of the church i heard people saying in the crowd that the bride was an heiress that she had a dowry of five hundred thousand and a trousseau worth ever so much it was a good stroke of business though i thought as i made my way into the street polzunkov a story i began to scrutinize the man closely even in his exterior there was something so peculiar that it compelled one however far away ones thoughts might be to fix ones eyes upon him and go off into the most irrepressible roar of laughter that is what happened to me i must observe that the little mans eyes were so mobile or perhaps he was so sensitive to the magnetism of every eye fixed upon him that he almost by instinct guessed that he was being observed turned at once to the observer and anxiously analysed his expression his continual mobility his turning and twisting made him look strikingly like a dancing doll it was strange he seemed afraid of jeers in spite of the fact that he was almost getting his living by being a buffoon for all the world and exposed himself to every buffet in a moral sense and even in a physical one judging from the company he was in voluntary buffoons are not even to be pitied but i noticed at once that this strange creature this ridiculous man was by no means a buffoon by profession there was still something gentlemanly in him his very uneasiness his continual apprehensiveness about himself were actually a testimony in his favour it seemed to me that his desire to be obliging was due more to kindness of heart than to mercenary considerations he readily allowed them to laugh their loudest at him and in the most unseemly way to his face but at the same timeand i am ready to take my oath on ithis heart ached and was sore at the thought that his listeners were so caddishly brutal as to be capable of laughing not at anything said or done but at him at his whole being at his heart at his head at his appearance at his whole body flesh and blood i am convinced that he felt at that moment all the foolishness of his position but the protest died away in his heart at once though it invariably sprang up again in the most heroic way i am convinced that all this was due to nothing else but a kind heart and not to fear of the inconvenience of being kicked out and being unable to borrow money from some one this gentleman was for ever borrowing money that is he asked for alms in that form when after playing the fool and entertaining them at his expense he felt in a certain sense entitled to borrow money from them but good heavens what a business the borrowing was and with what a countenance he asked for the loan i could not have imagined that on such a small space as the wrinkled angular face of that little man room could be found at one and the same time for so many different grimaces for such strange variously characteristic shades of feeling such absolutely killing expressions everything was thereshame and an assumption of insolence and vexation at the sudden flushing of his face and anger and fear of failure and entreaty to be forgiven for having dared to pester and a sense of his own dignity and a still greater sense of his own abjectnessall this passed over his face like lightning for six whole years he had struggled along in gods world in this way and so far had been unable to take up a fitting attitude at the interesting moment of borrowing money i need not say that he never could grow callous and completely abject his heart was too sensitive too passionate i will say more indeed in my opinion he was one of the most honest and honourable men in the world but with a little weakness of being ready to do anything abject at any ones bidding goodnaturedly and disinterestedly simply to oblige a fellowcreature in short he was what is called a rag in the fullest sense of the word the most absurd thing was that he was dressed like any one else neither worse nor better tidily even with a certain elaborateness and actually had pretentions to respectability and personal dignity this external equality and internal inequality his uneasiness about himself and at the same time his continual selfdepreciationall this was strikingly incongruous and provocative of laughter and pity if he had been convinced in his heart and in spite of his experience it did happen to him at moments to believe this that his audience were the most goodnatured people in the world who were simply laughing at something amusing and not at the sacrifice of his personal dignity he would most readily have taken off his coat put it on wrong side outwards and have walked about the streets in that attire for the diversion of others and his own gratification but equality he could never anyhow attain another trait the queer fellow was proud and even by fits and starts when it was not too risky generous it was worth seeing and hearing how he could sometimes not sparing himself consequently with pluck almost with heroism dispose of one of his patrons who had infuriated him to madness but that was at moments in short he was a martyr in the fullest sense of the word but the most useless and consequently the most comic martyr there was a general discussion going on among the guests all at once i saw our queer friend jump upon his chair and call out at the top of his voice anxious for the exclusive attention of the company listen the master of the house whispered to me he sometimes tells the most curious stories does he interest you i nodded and squeezed myself into the group the sight of a welldressed gentleman jumping upon his chair and shouting at the top of his voice did in fact draw the attention of all many who did not know the queer fellow looked at one another in perplexity the others roared with laughter i knew fedosey nikolaitch i ought to know fedosey nikolaitch better than any one cried the queer fellow from his elevation gentlemen allow me to tell you something i can tell you a good story about fedosey nikolaitch i know a storyexquisite tell it osip mihalitch tell it tell it listen listen listen i begin but gentlemen this is a peculiar story very good very good its a comic story very good excellent splendid get on it is an episode in the private life of your humble but why do you trouble yourself to announce that its comic and even somewhat tragic eh in short the story which it will afford you all pleasure to hear me now relate gentlementhe story in consequence of which i have come into company so interesting and profitable no puns this story in short the storymake haste and finish the introduction the story which has its value a fairhaired young man with moustaches pronounced in a husky voice dropping his hand into his coat pocket and as though by chance pulling out a purse instead of his handkerchief the story my dear sirs after which i should like to see many of you in my place and finally the story in consequence of which i have not married married a wife polzunkov tried to get married i confess i should like to see madame polzunkov allow me to inquire the name of the wouldbe madame polzunkov piped a youth making his way up to the storyteller and so for the first chapter gentlemen it was just six years ago in spring the thirtyfirst of marchnote the date gentlemenon the eve of the first of april cried a young man with ringlets you are extraordinarily quick at guessing it was evening twilight was gathering over the district town of n the moon was about to float out everything in proper style in fact and so in the very late twilight i too floated out of my poor lodging on the slyafter taking leave of my restricted granny now dead excuse me gentlemen for making use of such a fashionable expression which i heard for the last time from nikolay nikolaitch but my granny was indeed restricted she was blind dumb deaf stupideverything you please i confess i was in a tremor i was prepared for great deeds my heart was beating like a kittens when some bony hand clutches it by the scruff of the neck excuse me monsieur polzunkov what do you want tell it more simply dont overexert yourself please all right said osip mihalitch a little taken aback i went into the house of fedosey nikolaitch the house that he had bought fedosey nikolaitch as you know is not a mere colleague but the fullblown head of a department i was announced and was at once shown into the study i can see it now the room was dark almost dark but candles were not brought behold fedosey nikolaitch walks in there he and i were left in the darkness whatever happened to you asked an officer what do you suppose asked polzunkov turning promptly with a convulsively working face to the young man with ringlets well gentlemen a strange circumstance occurred though indeed there was nothing strange in it it was what is called an everyday affairi simply took out of my pocket a roll of paper and he a roll of paper paper notes paper notes and we exchanged i dont mind betting that theres a flavour of bribery about it observed a respectably dressed closely cropped young gentleman bribery polzunkov caught him up oh may i be a liberal such as many i have seen if you too when it is your lot to serve in the provinces do not warm your hands at your countrys hearth for as an author said even the smoke of our native land is sweet to us she is our mother gentlemen our mother russia we are her babes and so we suck her there was a roar of laughter only would you believe it gentlemen i have never taken bribes said polzunkov looking round at the whole company distrustfully a prolonged burst of homeric laughter drowned polzunkovs words in guffaws it really is so gentlemen but here he stopped still looking round at every one with a strange expression of face perhapswho knowsat that moment the thought came into his mind that he was more honest than many of all that honourable company anyway the serious expression of his face did not pass away till the general merriment was quite over and so polzunkov began again when all was still though i never did take bribes yet that time i transgressed i put in my pocket a bribe from a bribetaker that is there were certain papers in my hands which if i had cared to send to a certain person it would have gone ill with fedosey nikolaitch so then he bought them from you he did did he give much he gave as much as many a man nowadays would sell his conscience for complete with all its variations if only he could get anything for it but i felt as though i were scalded when i put the money in my pocket i really dont understand what always comes over me gentlemenbut i was more dead than alive my lips twitched and my legs trembled well i was to blame to blame entirely to blame i was utterly consciencestricken i was ready to beg fedosey nikolaitchs forgiveness well what did he dodid he forgive you but i didnt ask his forgiveness i only mean that that is how i felt then i have a sensitive heart you know i saw he was looking me straight in the face have you no fear of god osip mihailitch said he well what could i do from a feeling of propriety i put my head on one side and i flung up my hands in what way said i have i no fear of god fedosey nikolaitch but i just said that from a feeling of propriety i was ready to sink into the earth after being so long a friend of our family after being i may say like a sonand who knows what heaven had in store for us osip mihailitchand all of a sudden to inform against meto think of that now what am i to think of mankind after that osip mihailitch yes gentlemen he did read me a lecture come he said you tell me what i am to think of mankind after that osip mihailitch what is he to think i thought and do you know there was a lump in my throat and my voice was quivering and knowing my hateful weakness i snatched up my hat where are you off to osip mihailitch surely on the eve of such a day you cannot bear malice against me what wrong have i done you fedosey nikolaitch i said fedosey nikolaitch in fact i melted gentlemen i melted like a sugarstick and the roll of notes that was lying in my pocket that too seemed screaming out you ungrateful brigand you accursed thief it seemed to weigh a hundredweight if only it had weighed a hundredweight i see says fedosey nikolaitch i see your penitence you know tomorrow st mary of egypts day well dont weep said fedosey nikolaitch thats enough youve erred and you are penitent come along maybe i may succeed in bringing you back again into the true path says he maybe my modest penates yespenates i remember he used that expression the rascal will warm says he your harden i will not say hardened but erring heart he took me by the arm gentlemen and led me to his family circle a cold shiver ran down my back i shuddered i thought with what eyes shall i present myselfyou must know gentlemen eh what shall i saya delicate position had arisen here not madame polzunkov marya fedosyevna only she was not destined you know to bear the name you have given her she did not attain that honour fedosey nikolaitch was right you see when he said that i was almost looked upon as a son in the house it had been so indeed six months before when a certain retired junker called mihailo maximitch dvigailov was still living but by gods will he died and he put off settling his affairs till death settled his business for him ough well never mind gentlemen forgive me it was a slip of the tongue its a bad pun but it doesnt matter its being badwhat happened was far worse when i was left so to say with nothing in prospect but a bullet through the brain for that junker though he would not admit me into his house he lived in grand style for he had always known how to feather his nest yet perhaps correctly he believed me to be his son aha yes that was how it was so they began to coldshoulder me at fedosey nikolaitchs i noticed things i kept quiet but all at once unluckily for me or perhaps luckily a cavalry officer galloped into our little town like snow on our head his businessbuying horses for the armywas light and active in cavalry style but he settled himself solidly at fedosey nikolaitchs as though he were laying siege to it i approached the subject in a roundabout way as my nasty habit is i said one thing and another asking him what i had done to be treated so saying that i was almost like a son to him and when might i expect him to behave more like a father well he began answering me and when he begins to speak you are in for a regular epic in twelve cantos and all you can do is to listen lick your lips and throw up your hands in delight and not a haporth of sense at least theres no making out the sense you stand puzzled like a foolhe puts you in a fog he twists about like an eel and wriggles away from you its a special gift a real giftits enough to frighten people even if it is no concern of theirs i tried one thing and another and went hither and thither i took the lady songs and presented her with sweets and thought of witty things to say to her i tried sighing and groaning my heart aches i said it aches from love and i went in for tears and secret explanations man is foolish you know i never reminded myself that i was thirty not a bit of it i tried all my arts it was no go it was a failure and i gained nothing but jeers and gibes i was indignant i was choking with anger i slunk off and would not set foot in the house i thought and thought and made up my mind to denounce him well of course it was a shabby thingi meant to give away a friend i confess i had heaps of material and splendid materiala grand case it brought me fifteen hundred roubles when i changed it and my report on it for bank notes ah so that was the bribe yes sir that was the bribeand it was a bribetaker who had to pay itand i didnt do wrong i can assure you well now i will go on he drew me if you will kindly remember more dead than alive into the room where they were having tea they all met me seeming as it were offended that is not exactly offended but hurtso hurt that it was simply they seemed shattered absolutely shattered and at the same time there was a look of becoming dignity on their faces a gravity in their expression something fatherly parental the prodigal son had come back to themthats what it had come to they made me sit down to tea but there was no need to do that i felt as though a samovar was toiling in my bosom and my feet were like ice i was humbled i was cowed marya fominishna his wife addressed me familiarly from the first word how is it you have grown so thin my boy ive not been very well marya fominishna i said my wretched voice shook and then quite suddenlyshe must have been waiting for a chance to get a dig at me the old snakeshe said i suppose your conscience felt ill at ease osip mihalitch my dear our fatherly hospitality was a reproach to you you have been punished for the tears i have shed yes upon my word she really said thatshe had the conscience to say it why that was nothing to her she was a terror she did nothing but sit there and pour out tea but if you were in the market my darling i thought youd shout louder than any fishwife there thats the kind of woman she was and then to my undoing the daughter marya fedosyevna came in in all her innocence a little pale and her eyes red as though she had been weeping i was bowled over on the spot like a fool but it turned out afterwards that the tears were a tribute to the cavalry officer he had made tracks for home and taken his hook for good and all for you know it was high time for him to be offi may as well mention the fact here not that his leave was up precisely but you see it was only later that the loving parents grasped the position and had found out all that had happened what could they do they hushed their trouble upan addition to the family well i could not help itas soon as i looked at her i was done for i stole a glance at my hat i wanted to get up and make off but there was no chance of that they took away my hat i must confess i did think of getting off without it well i thoughtbut no they latched the doors there followed friendly jokes winking little airs and graces i was overcome with embarrassment said something stupid talked nonsense about love my charmer sat down to the piano and

jolly drunk tomorrow you can have a spree my dear soulyour master is getting married my heart was full of jokes and laughter i was beginning to drop off to sleep but something made me get up again i sat in thought tomorrow is the first of april a bright and playful daywhat should i do and i thought of something why gentlemen i got out of bed lighted a candle and sat down to the writingtable just as i was i was in a fever of excitement quite carried awayyou know gentlemen what it is when a man is quite carried away i wallowed joyfully in the mud my dear friends you see what i am like they take something from you and you give them something else as well and say take that too they strike you on the cheek and in your joy you offer them your whole back then they try to lure you like a dog with a bun and you embrace them with your foolish paws and fall to kissing them with all your heart and soul why see what i am doing now gentlemen you are laughing and whisperingi see it after i have told you all my story you will begin to turn me into ridicule you will begin to attack me but yet i go on talking and talking and talking and who tells me to who drives me to do it who is standing behind my back whispering to me speak speak and tell them and yet i do talk i go on telling you i try to please you as though you were my brothers all my dearest friends ech the laughter which had sprung up by degrees on all sides completely drowned at last the voice of the speaker who really seemed worked up into a sort of ecstasy he paused for several minutes his eyes strayed about the company then suddenly as though carried away by a whirlwind he waved his hand burst out laughing himself as though he really found his position amusing and fell to telling his story again i scarcely slept all night gentlemen i was scribbling all night you see i thought of a trick ech gentlemen the very thought of it makes me ashamed it wouldnt have been so bad if it all had been done at nighti might have been drunk blundered been silly and talked nonsensebut not a bit of it i woke up in the morning as soon as it was light i hadnt slept more than an hour or two and was in the same mind i dressed i washed i curled and pomaded my hair put on my new dress coat and went straight off to spend the holiday with fedosey nikolaitch and i kept the joke i had written in my hat he met me again with open arms and invited me again to his fatherly waistcoat but i assumed an air of dignity i had the joke i thought of the night before in my mind i drew a step back no fedosey nikolaitch but will you please read this letter and i gave it him together with my daily report and do you know what was in it why for such and such reasons the aforesaid osip mihalitch asks to be discharged and under my petition i signed my full rank just think what a notion good lord it was the cleverest thing i could think of as today was the first of april i was pretending for the sake of a joke that my resentment was not over that i had changed my mind in the night and was grumpy and more offended than ever as though to say my dear benefactor i dont want to know you nor your daughter either i put the money in my pocket yesterday so i am secureso heres my petition for a transfer to be discharged i dont care to serve under such a chief as fedosey nikolaitch i want to go into a different office and then maybe ill inform i pretended to be a regular scoundrel i wanted to frighten them and a nice way of frightening them wasnt it a pretty thing gentlemen wasnt it you see my heart had grown tender towards them since the day before so i thought i would have a little joke at the familyi would tease the fatherly heart of fedosey nikolaitch as soon as he took my letter and opened it i saw his whole countenance change whats the meaning of this osip mihalitch and like a little fool i said the first of april many happy returns of the day fedosey nikolaitch just like a silly schoolboy who hides behind his grandmothers armchair and then shouts oof into her ear suddenly at the top of his voice meaning to frighten her yes yes i feel quite ashamed to talk about it gentlemen no i wont tell you nonsense what happened then nonsense nonsense tell us yes do rose on all sides there was an outcry and a hullabaloo my dear friends such exclamations of surprise and you mischievous fellow you naughty man and what a fright i had given themand all so sweet that i felt ashamed and wondered how such a holy place could be profaned by a sinner like me well my dear boy piped the mamma you gave me such a fright that my legs are all of a tremble still i can hardly stand on my feet i ran to masha as though i were crazy mashenka i said what will become of us see how your friend has turned out and i was unjust to you my dear boy you must forgive an old woman like me i was taken in well i thought when he got home last night he got home late he began thinking and perhaps he fancied that we sent for him on purpose yesterday that we wanted to get hold of him i turned cold at the thought give over mashenka dont go on winking at meosip mihalitch isnt a stranger i am your mother i am not likely to say any harm thank god i am not twenty but turned fortyfive well gentlemen i almost flopped at her feet on the spot again there were tears again there were kisses jokes began fedosey nikolaitch too thought he would make april fools of us he told us the fiery bird had flown up with a letter in her diamond beak he tried to take us in toodidnt we laugh werent we touched foo i feel ashamed to talk about it well my good friends the end is not far off now one day passed two three a week i was regularly engaged to her i should think so the wedding rings were ordered the day was fixed only they did not want to make it public for a timethey wanted to wait for the inspectors visit to be over i was all impatience for the inspectors arrivalmy happiness depended upon him i was in a hurry to get his visit over and in the excitement and rejoicing fedosey nikolaitch threw all the work upon me writing up the accounts making up the reports checking the books balancing the totals i found things in terrible disordereverything had been neglected there were muddles and irregularities everywhere well i thought i must do my best for my fatherinlaw and he was ailing all the time he was taken ill it appears he seemed to get worse day by day and indeed i grew as thin as a rake myself i was afraid i would break down however i finished the work grandly i got things straight for him in time suddenly they sent a messenger for me i ran headlongwhat could it be i saw my fedosey nikolaitch his head bandaged up in a vinegar compress frowning sighing and moaning my dear boy my son he said if i die to whom shall i leave you my darlings his wife trailed in with all his children mashenka was in tears and i blubbered too oh no he said god will be merciful he will not visit my transgressions on you then he dismissed them all told me to shut the door after them and we were left alone ttette i have a favour to ask of you what favour well my dear boy there is no rest for me even on my deathbed i am in want

but i have lent it all to friendshow is one to collect it all in a minute i simply fell on my knees before him my benefactor i cried ive wronged you i have injured you it was slanderers who wrote

little joke fedosey nikolaitch i didnt mean it i just gave you the letter for your fatherly thats all thats all a queer joke sir does one jest with documents like that why you are sometimes sent to

character oh another thing ive just bought a house from matveyev we are moving in in a day or two so i expect i shall not have the pleasure of seeing you at our new residence bon voyage i ran home we are lost granny she wailed poor dear and then i saw the page from fedosey nikolaitchs running up with a note and a birdcage and in the cage there was a starling in the fullness of my heart i had given her the starling and in the note there were the words april st and nothing more what do you think of that gentlemen what happened then what happened then what then i met fedosey nikolaitch once i meant to tell him to his face he was a scoundrel well but somehow i couldnt bring myself to it gentlemen a little hero a story at that time i was nearly eleven i had been sent in july to spend the holiday in a village near moscow with a relation of mine called t whose house was full of guests fifty or perhaps more i dont remember i didnt count the house was full of noise and gaiety it seemed as though it were a continual holiday which would never end it seemed as though our host had taken a vow to squander all his vast fortune as rapidly as possible and he did indeed succeed not long ago in justifying this surmise that is in making a clean sweep of it all to the last stick fresh visitors used to drive up every minute moscow was close by in sight so that those who drove away only made room for others and the everlasting holiday went on its course festivities succeeded one another and there was no end in sight to the entertainments there were riding parties about the environs excursions to the forest or the river picnics dinners in the open air suppers on the great terrace of the house bordered with three rows of gorgeous flowers that flooded with their fragrance the fresh night air and illuminated the brilliant lights which made our ladies who were almost every one of them pretty at all times seem still more charming with their faces excited by the impressions of the day with their sparkling eyes with their interchange of spritely conversation their peals of ringing laughter dancing music singing if the sky were overcast tableaux vivants charades proverbs were arranged private theatricals were got up there were good talkers storytellers wits certain persons were prominent in the foreground of course backbiting and slander ran their course as without them the world could not get on and millions of persons would perish of boredom like flies but as i was at that time eleven i was absorbed by very different interests and either failed to observe these people or if i noticed anything did not see it all it was only afterwards that some things came back to my mind my childish eyes could only see the brilliant side of the picture and the general animation splendour and bustleall that seen and heard for the first time made such an impression upon me that for the first few days i was completely bewildered and my little head was in a whirl i keep speaking of my age and of course i was a child nothing more than a child many of these lovely ladies petted me without dreaming of considering my age but strange to say a sensation which i did not myself understand already had possession of me something was already whispering in my heart of which till then it had had no knowledge no conception and for some reason it began all at once to burn and throb and often my face glowed with a sudden flush at times i felt as it were abashed and even resentful of the various privileges of my childish years at other times a sort of wonder overwhelmed me and i would go off into some corner where i could sit unseen as though to take breath and remember somethingsomething which it seemed to me i had remembered perfectly till then and now had suddenly forgotten something without which i could not show myself anywhere and could not exist at all at last it seemed to me as though i were hiding something from every one but nothing would have induced me to speak of it to any one because small boy that i was i was ready to weep with shame soon in the midst of the vortex around me i was conscious of a certain loneliness there were other children but all were either much older or younger than i besides i was in no mood for them of course nothing would have happened to me if i had not been in an exceptional position in the eyes of those charming ladies i was still the little unformed creature whom they at once liked to pet and with whom they could play as though he were a little doll one of them particularly a fascinating fair woman with very thick luxuriant hair such as i had never seen before and probably shall never see again seemed to have taken a vow never to leave me in peace i was confused while she was amused by the laughter which she continually provoked from all around us by her wild giddy pranks with me and this apparently gave her immense enjoyment at school among her schoolfellows she was probably nicknamed the tease she was wonderfully goodlooking and there was something in her beauty which drew ones eyes from the first moment and certainly she had nothing in common with the ordinary modest little fair girls white as down and soft as white mice or pastors daughters she was not very tall and was rather plump but had soft delicate exquisitely cut features there was something quick as lightning in her face and indeed she was like fire all over light swift alive her big open eyes seemed to flash sparks they glittered like diamonds and i would never exchange such blue sparkling eyes for any black ones were they blacker than any andalusian orb and indeed my blonde was fully a match for the famous brunette whose praises were sung by a great and wellknown poet who in a superb poem vowed by all castille that he was ready to break his bones to be permitted only to touch the mantle of his divinity with the tip of his finger add to that that my charmer was the merriest in the world the wildest giggler playful as a child although she had been married for the last five years there was a continual laugh upon her lips fresh as the morning rose that with the first ray of sunshine opens its fragrant crimson bud with the cool dewdrops still hanging heavy upon it i remember that the day after my arrival private theatricals were being got up the drawingroom was as they say packed to overflowing there was not a seat empty and as i was somehow late i had to enjoy the performance standing but the amusing play attracted me to move forwarder and forwarder and unconsciously i made my way to the first row where i stood at last leaning my elbows on the back of an armchair in which a lady was sitting it was my blonde divinity but we had not yet made acquaintance and i gazed as it happened at her marvellous fascinating shoulders plump and white as milk though it did not matter to me in the least whether i stared at a womans exquisite shoulders or at the cap with flaming ribbons that covered the grey locks of a venerable lady in the front row near my blonde divinity sat a spinster lady not in her first youth one of those who as i chanced to observe later always take refuge in the immediate neighbourhood of young and pretty women selecting such as are not fond of coldshouldering young men but that is not the point only this lady noting my fixed gaze bent down to her neighbour and with a simper whispered something in her ear the blonde lady turned at once and i remember that her glowing eyes so flashed upon me in the half dark that not prepared to meet them i started as though i were scalded the beauty smiled do you like what they are acting she asked looking into my face with a shy and mocking expression yes i answered still gazing at her with a sort of wonder that evidently pleased her but why are you standing youll get tired cant you find a seat thats just it i cant i answered more occupied with my grievance than with the beautys sparkling eyes and rejoicing in earnest at having found a kind heart to whom i could confide my troubles i have looked everywhere but all the chairs are taken i added as though complaining to her that all the chairs were taken come here she said briskly quick to act on every decision and indeed on every mad idea that flashed on her giddy brain come here and sit on my knee on your knee i repeated taken aback i have mentioned already that i had begun to resent the privileges of childhood and to be ashamed of them in earnest this lady as though in derision had gone ever so much further than the others moreover i had always been a shy and bashful boy and of late had begun to be particularly shy with women why yes on my knee why dont you want to sit on my knee she persisted beginning to laugh more and more so that at last she was simply giggling goodness knows at what perhaps at her freak or perhaps at my confusion but that was just what she wanted i flushed and in my confusion looked round trying to find where to escape but seeing my intention she managed to catch hold of my hand to prevent me from going away and pulling it towards her suddenly quite unexpectedly to my intense astonishment squeezed it in her mischievous warm fingers and began to pinch my fingers till they hurt so much that i had to do my very utmost not to cry out and in my effort to control myself made the most absurd grimaces i was besides moved to the greatest amazement perplexity and even horror at the discovery that there were ladies so absurd and spiteful as to talk nonsense to boys and even pinch their fingers for no earthly reason and before everybody probably my unhappy face reflected my bewilderment for the mischievous creature laughed in my face as though she were crazy and meantime she was pinching my fingers more and more vigorously she was highly delighted in playing such a mischievous prank and completely mystifying and embarrassing a poor boy my position was desperate in the first place i was hot with shame because almost every one near had turned round to look at us some in wonder others with laughter grasping at once that the beauty was up to some mischief i dreadfully wanted to scream too for she was wringing my fingers with positive fury just because i didnt scream while i like a spartan made up my mind to endure the agony afraid by crying out of causing a general fuss which was more than i could face in utter despair i began at last struggling with her trying with all my might to pull away my hand but my persecutor was much stronger than i was at last i could bear it no longer and uttered a shriekthat was all she was waiting for instantly she let me go and turned away as though nothing had happened as though it was not she who had played the trick but some one else exactly like some schoolboy who as soon as the masters back is turned plays some trick on some one near him pinches some small weak boy gives him a flip a kick or a nudge with his elbows and instantly turns again buries himself in his book and begins repeating his lesson and so makes a fool of the infuriated teacher who flies down like a hawk at the noise but luckily for me the general attention was distracted at the moment by the masterly acting of our host who was playing the chief part in the performance some comedy of scribes every one began to applaud under cover of the noise i stole away and hurried to the furthest end of the room from which concealed behind a column i looked with horror towards the place where the treacherous beauty was sitting she was still laughing holding her handkerchief to her lips and for a long time she was continually turning round looking for me in every direction probably regretting that our silly tussle was so soon over and hatching some other trick to play on me that was the beginning of our acquaintance and from that evening she would never let me alone she persecuted me without consideration or conscience she became my tyrant and tormentor the whole absurdity of her jokes with me lay in the fact that she pretended to be head over ears in love with me and teased me before every one of course for a wild creature as i was all this was so tiresome and vexatious that it almost reduced me to tears and i was sometimes put in such a difficult position that i was on the point of fighting with my treacherous admirer my nave confusion my desperate distress seemed to egg her on to persecute me more she knew no mercy while i did not know how to get away from her the laughter which always accompanied us and which she knew so well how to excite roused her to fresh pranks but at last people began to think that she went a little too far in her jests and indeed as i remember now she did take outrageous liberties with a child such as i was but that was her character she was a spoilt child in every respect i heard afterwards that her husband a very short very fat and very redfaced man very rich and apparently very much occupied with business spoilt her more than any one always busy and flying round he could not stay two hours in one place every day he drove into moscow sometimes twice in the day and always as he declared himself on business it would be hard to find a livelier and more goodnatured face than his facetious but always wellbred countenance he not only loved his wife to the point of weakness softness he simply worshipped her like an idol he did not restrain her in anything she had masses of friends male and female in the first place almost everybody liked her and secondly the featherheaded creature was not herself over particular in the choice of her friends though there was a much more serious foundation to her character than might be supposed from what i have just said about her but of all her friends she liked best of all one young lady a distant relation who was also of our party now there existed between them a tender and subtle affection one of those attachments which sometimes spring up at the meeting of two dispositions often the very opposite of each other of which one is deeper purer and more austere while the other with lofty humility and generous selfcriticism lovingly gives way to the other conscious of the friends superiority and cherishing the friendship as a happiness then begins that tender and noble subtlety in the relations of such characters love and infinite indulgence on the one side on the other love and respecta respect approaching awe approaching anxiety as to the impression made on the friend so highly prized and an eager jealous desire to get closer and closer to that friends heart in every step in life these two friends were of the same age but there was an immense difference between them in everythingin looks to begin with madame m was also very handsome but there was something special in her beauty that strikingly distinguished her from the crowd of pretty women there was something in her face that at once drew the affection of all to her or rather which aroused a generous and lofty feeling of kindliness in every one who met her there are such happy faces at her side everyone grew as it were better freer more cordial and yet her big mournful eyes full of fire and vigour had a timid and anxious look as though every minute dreading something antagonistic and menacing and this strange timidity at times cast so mournful a shade over her mild gentle features which recalled the serene faces of italian madonnas that looking at her one soon became oneself sad as though for some trouble of ones own the pale thin face in which through the irreproachable beauty of the pure regular lines and the mournful severity of some mute hidden grief there often flitted the clear looks of early childhood telling of trustful years and perhaps simplehearted happiness in the recent past the gentle but diffident hesitating smile all aroused such unaccountable sympathy for her that every heart was unconsciously stirred with a sweet and warm anxiety that powerfully interceded on her behalf even at a distance and made even strangers feel akin to her but the lovely creature seemed silent and reserved though no one could have been more attentive and loving if any one needed sympathy there are women who are like sisters of mercy in life nothing can be hidden from them nothing at least that is a sore or wound of the heart any one who is suffering may go boldly and hopefully to them without fear of being a burden for few men know the infinite patience of love compassion and forgiveness that may be found in some womens hearts perfect treasures of sympathy consolation and hope are laid up in these pure hearts so often full of suffering of their ownfor a heart which loves much grieves muchthough their wounds are carefully hidden from the curious eye for deep sadness is most often mute and concealed they are not dismayed by the depth of the wound nor by its foulness and its stench any one who comes to them is deserving of help they are as it were born for heroism mme m was tall supple and graceful but rather thin all her movements seemed somehow irregular at times slow smooth and even dignified at times childishly hasty and yet at the same time there was a sort of timid humility in her gestures something tremulous and defenceless though it neither desired nor asked for protection i have mentioned already that the outrageous teasing of the treacherous fair lady abashed me flabbergasted me and wounded me to the quick but there was for that another secret strange and foolish reason which i concealed at which i shuddered as at a skeleton at the very thought of it brooding utterly alone and overwhelmed in some dark mysterious corner to which the inquisitorial mocking eye of the blueeyed rogue could not penetrate i almost gasped with confusion shame and fearin short i was in love that perhaps is nonsense that could hardly have been but why was it of all the faces surrounding me only her face caught my attention why was it that it was only she whom i cared to follow with my eyes though i certainly had no inclination in those days to watch ladies and seek their acquaintance this happened most frequently on the evenings when we were all kept indoors by bad weather and when lonely hiding in some corner of the big drawingroom i stared about me aimlessly unable to find anything to do for except my teasing ladies few people ever addressed me and i was insufferably bored on such evenings then i stared at the people round me listened to the conversation of which i often did not understand one word and at that time the mild eyes the gentle smile and lovely face of mme m for she was the object of my passion for some reason caught my fascinated attention and the strange vague but unutterably sweet impression remained with me often for hours together i could not tear myself away from her i studied every gesture every movement she made listened to every vibration of her rich silvery but rather muffled voice but strange to say as the result of all my observations i felt mixed with a sweet and timid impression a feeling of intense curiosity it seemed as though i were on the verge of some mystery nothing distressed me so much as being mocked at in the presence of mme m this mockery and humorous persecution as i thought humiliated me and when there was a general burst of laughter at my expense in which mme m sometimes could not help joining in despair beside myself with misery i used to tear myself from my tormentor and run away upstairs where i remained in solitude the rest of the day not daring to show my face in the drawingroom i did not yet however understand my shame nor my agitation the whole process went on in me unconsciously i had hardly said two words to mme m and indeed i should not have dared to but one evening after an unbearable day i turned back from an expedition with the rest of the company i was horribly tired and made my way home across the garden on a seat in a secluded avenue i saw mme m she was sitting quite alone as though she had purposely chosen this solitary spot her head was drooping and she was mechanically twisting her handkerchief she was so lost in thought that she did not hear me till i reached her noticing me she got up quickly from her seat turned round and i saw her hurriedly wipe her eyes with her handkerchief she was crying drying her eyes she smiled to me and walked back with me to the house i dont remember what we talked about but she frequently sent me off on one pretext or another to pick a flower or to see who was riding in the next avenue and when i walked away from her she at once put her handkerchief to her eyes again and wiped away rebellious tears which would persist in rising again and again from her heart and dropping from her poor eyes i realized that i was very much in her way when she sent me off so often and indeed she saw herself that i noticed it all but yet could not control herself and that made my heart ache more and more for her i raged at myself at that moment and was almost in despair cursed myself for my awkwardness and lack of resource and at the same time did not know how to leave her tactfully without betraying that i had noticed her distress but walked beside her in mournful bewilderment almost in alarm utterly at a loss and unable to find a single word to keep up our scanty conversation this meeting made such an impression on me that i stealthily watched mme m the whole evening with eager curiosity and never took my eyes off her but it happened that she twice caught me unawares watching her and on the second occasion noticing me she gave me a smile it was the only time she smiled that evening the look of sadness had not left her face which was now very pale she spent the whole evening talking to an illnatured and quarrelsome old lady whom nobody liked owing to her spying and backbiting habits but of whom every one was afraid and consequently every one felt obliged to be polite to her at ten oclock mme ms husband arrived till that moment i watched her very attentively never taking my eyes off her mournful face now at the unexpected entrance of her husband i saw her start and her pale face turned suddenly as white as a handkerchief it was so noticeable that other people observed it i overheard a fragmentary conversation from which i guessed that mme m was not quite happy they said her husband was as jealous as an arab not from love but from vanity he was before all things a european a modern man who sampled the newest ideas and prided himself upon them in appearance he was a tall darkhaired particularly thickset man with european whiskers with a selfsatisfied red face with teeth white as sugar and with an irreproachably gentlemanly deportment he was called a clever man such is the name given in certain circles to a peculiar species of mankind which grows fat at other peoples expense which does absolutely nothing and has no desire to do anything and whose heart has turned into a lump of fat from everlasting slothfulness and idleness you continually hear from such men that there is nothing they can do owing to certain very complicated and hostile circumstances which thwart their genius and that it was sad to see the waste of their talents this is a fine phrase of theirs their mot dordre their watchword a phrase which these wellfed fat friends of ours bring out at every minute so that it has long ago bored us as an arrant tartuffism an empty form of words some however of these amusing creatures who cannot succeed in finding anything to dothough indeed they never seek ittry to make every one believe that they have not a lump of fat for a heart but on the contrary something very deep though what precisely the greatest surgeon would hardly venture to decidefrom civility of course these gentlemen make their way in the world through the fact that all their instincts are bent in the direction of coarse sneering shortsighted censure and immense conceit since they have nothing else to do but note and emphasize the mistakes and weaknesses of others and as they have precisely as much good feeling as an oyster it is not difficult for them with such powers of selfpreservation to get on with people fairly successfully they pride themselves extremely upon that they are for instance as good as persuaded that almost the whole world owes them something that it is theirs like an oyster which they keep in reserve that all are fools except themselves that every one is like an orange or a sponge which they will squeeze as soon as they want the juice that they are the masters everywhere and that all this acceptable state of affairs is solely due to the fact that they are people of so much intellect and character in their measureless conceit they do not admit any defects in themselves they are like that species of practical rogues innate tartuffes and falstaffs who are such thorough rogues that at last they have come to believe that that is as it should be that is that they should spend their lives in knavishness they have so often assured every one that they are honest men that they have come to believe that they are honest men and that their roguery is honesty they are never capable of inner judgment before their conscience of generous selfcriticism for some things they are too fat their own priceless personality their baal and moloch their magnificent ego is always in their foreground everywhere all nature the whole world for them is no more than a splendid mirror created for the little god to admire himself continually in it and to see no one and nothing behind himself so it is not strange that he sees everything in the world in such a hideous light he has a phrase in readiness for everything andthe acme of ingenuity on his partthe most fashionable phrase it is just these people indeed who help to make the fashion proclaiming at every crossroad an idea in which they scent success a fine nose is just what they have for sniffing a fashionable phrase and making it their own before other people get hold of it so that it seems to have originated with them they have a particular store of phrases for proclaiming their profound sympathy for humanity for defining what is the most correct and rational form of philanthropy and continually attacking romanticism in other words everything fine and true each atom of which is more precious than all their mollusc tribe but they are too coarse to recognize the truth in an indirect roundabout and unfinished form and they reject everything that is immature still fermenting and unstable the wellnourished man has spent all his life in merrymaking with everything provided has done nothing himself and does not know how hard every sort of work is and so woe betide you if you jar upon his fat feelings by any sort of roughness hell never forgive you for that he will always remember it and will gladly avenge it the long and short of it is that my hero is neither more nor less than a gigantic incredibly swollen bag full of sentences fashionable phrases and labels of all sorts and kinds m m however had a speciality and was a very remarkable man he was a wit good talker and storyteller and there was always a circle round him in every drawingroom that evening he was particularly successful in making an impression he took possession of the conversation he was in his best form gay pleased at something and he compelled the attention of all but mme m looked all the time as though she were ill her face was so sad that i fancied every minute that tears would begin quivering on her long eyelashes all this as i have said impressed me extremely and made me wonder i went away with a feeling of strange curiosity and dreamed all night of m m though till then i had rarely had dreams next day early in the morning i was summoned to a rehearsal of some tableaux vivants in which i had to take part the tableaux vivants theatricals and afterwards a dance were all fixed for the same evening five days laterthe birthday of our hosts younger daughter to this entertainment which was almost improvised another hundred guests were invited from moscow and from surrounding villas so that there was a great deal of fuss bustle and commotion the rehearsal or rather review of the costumes was fixed so early in the morning because our manager a wellknown artist a friend of our hosts who had consented through affection for him to undertake the arrangement of the tableaux and the training of us for them was in haste now to get to moscow to purchase properties and to make final preparations for the fte as there was no time to lose i took part in one tableau with mme m it was a scene from medival life and was called the lady of the castle and her page i felt unutterably confused on meeting mme m at the rehearsal i kept feeling that she would at once read in my eyes all the reflections the doubts the surmises that had arisen in my mind since the previous day i fancied too that i was as it were to blame in regard to her for having come upon her tears the day before and hindered her grieving so that she could hardly help looking at me askance as an unpleasant witness and unforgiven sharer of her secret but thank goodness it went off without any great trouble i was simply not noticed i think she had no thoughts to spare for me or for the rehearsal she was absentminded sad and gloomily thoughtful it was evident that she was worried by some great anxiety as soon as my part was over i ran away to change my clothes and ten minutes later came out on the verandah into the garden almost at the same time mme m came out by another door and immediately afterwards coming towards us appeared her selfsatisfied husband who was returning from the garden after just escorting into it quite a crowd of ladies and there handing them over to a competent cavaliere servente the meeting of the husband and wife was evidently unexpected mme m i dont know why grew suddenly confused and a faint trace of vexation was betrayed in her impatient movement the husband who had been carelessly whistling an air and with an air of profundity stroking his whiskers now on meeting his wife frowned and scrutinized her as i remember now with a markedly inquisitorial stare you are going into the garden he asked noticing the parasol and book in her hand no into the copse she said with a slight flush alone with him said mme m pointing to me i always go a walk alone in the morning she added speaking in an uncertain hesitating voice as people do when they tell their first lie hm and i have just taken the whole party there they have all met there together in the flower arbour to see n off he is going away you know something has gone wrong in odessa your cousin he meant the fair beauty is laughing and crying at the same time there is no making her out she says though that you are angry with n about something and so wouldnt go and see him off nonsense of course shes laughing said mme m coming down the verandah steps so this is your daily cavaliere servente added m m with a wry smile turning his lorgnette upon me page i cried angered by the lorgnette and the jeer and laughing straight in his face i jumped down the three steps of the verandah at one bound a pleasant walk muttered m m and went on his way of course i immediately joined mme m as soon as she indicated me to her husband and looked as though she had invited me to do so an hour before and as though i had been accompanying her on her walks every morning for the last month but i could not make out why she was so confused so embarrassed and what was in her mind when she brought herself to have recourse to her little lie why had she not simply said that she was going alone i did not know how to look at her but overwhelmed with wonder i began by degrees very navely peeping into her face but just as an hour before at the rehearsal she did not notice either my looks or my mute question the same anxiety only more intense and more distinct was apparent in her face in her agitation in her walk she was in haste and walked more and more quickly and kept looking uneasily down every avenue down every path in the wood that led in the direction of the garden and i too was expecting something suddenly there was the sound of horses hoofs behind us it was the whole party of ladies and gentlemen on horseback escorting n the gentleman who was so suddenly deserting us among the ladies was my fair tormentor of whom m m had told us that she was in tears but characteristically she was laughing like a child and was galloping briskly on a splendid bay horse on reaching us n took off his hat but did not stop nor say one word to mme m soon all the cavalcade disappeared from our sight i glanced at mme m and almost cried out in wonder she was standing as white as a handkerchief and big tears were gushing from her eyes by chance our eyes met mme m suddenly flushed and turned away for an instant and a distinct look of uneasiness and vexation flitted across her face i was in the way worse even than last time that was clearer than day but how was i to get away and as though guessing my difficulty mme m opened the book which she had in her hand and colouring and evidently trying not to look at me she said as though she had only suddenly realized it ah it is the second part ive made a mistake please bring me the first i could not but understand my part was over and i could not have been more directly dismissed i ran off with her book and did not come back the first part lay undisturbed on the table that morning but i was not myself in my heart there was a sort of haunting terror i did my utmost not to meet mme m but i looked with wild curiosity at the selfsatisfied person of m m as though there must be something special about him now i dont understand what was the meaning of my absurd curiosity i only remember that i was strangely perplexed by all that i had chanced to see that morning but the day was only just beginning and it was fruitful in events for me dinner was very early that day an expedition to a neighbouring hamlet to see a village festival that was taking place there had been fixed for the evening and so it was necessary to be in time to get ready i had been dreaming for the last three days of this excursion anticipating all sorts of delights almost all the company gathered together on the verandah for coffee i cautiously followed the others and concealed myself behind the third row of chairs i was attracted by curiosity and yet i was very anxious not to be seen by mme m but as luck would have it i was not far from my fair tormentor something miraculous and incredible was happening to her that day she looked twice as handsome i dont know how and why this happens but such miracles are by no means rare with women there was with us at this moment a new guest a tall palefaced young man the official admirer of our fair beauty who had just arrived from moscow as though on purpose to replace n of whom rumour said that he was desperately in love with the same lady as for the newly arrived guest he had for a long time past been on the same terms as benedick with beatrice in shakespeares much ado about nothing in short the fair beauty was in her very best form that day her chatter and her jests were so full of grace so trustfully nave so innocently careless she was persuaded of the general enthusiasm with such graceful selfconfidence that she really was all the time the centre of peculiar adoration a throng of surprised and admiring listeners was continually round her and she had never been so fascinating every word she uttered was marvellous and seductive was caught up and handed round in the circle and not one word one jest one sally was lost i fancy no one had expected from her such taste such brilliance such wit her best qualities were as a rule buried under the most harumscarum wilfulness the most schoolboyish pranks almost verging on buffoonery they were rarely noticed and when they were were hardly believed in so that now her extraordinary brilliancy was accompanied by an eager whisper of amazement among all there was however one peculiar and rather delicate circumstance judging at least by the part in it played by mme ms husband which contributed to her success the madcap venturedand i must add to the satisfaction of almost every one or at any rate to the satisfaction of all the young peopleto make a furious attack upon him owing to many causes probably of great consequence in her eyes she carried on with him a regular crossfire of witticisms of mocking and sarcastic sallies of that most illusive and treacherous kind that smoothly wrapped up on the surface hit the mark without giving the victim anything to lay hold of and exhaust him in fruitless efforts to repel the attack reducing him to fury and comic despair i dont know for certain but i fancy the whole proceeding was not improvised but premeditated this desperate duel had begun earlier at dinner i call it desperate because m m was not quick to surrender he had to call upon all his presence of mind all his sharp wit and rare resourcefulness not to be completely covered with ignominy the conflict was accompanied by the continual and irrepressible laughter of all who witnessed and took part in it that day was for him very different from the day before it was noticeable that mme m several times did her utmost to stop her indiscreet friend who was certainly trying to depict the jealous husband in the most grotesque and absurd guise in the guise of a bluebeard it must be supposed judging from all probabilities from what has remained in my memory and finally from the part which i myself was destined to play in the affair i was drawn into it in a most absurd manner quite unexpectedly and as illluck would have it at that moment i was standing where i could be seen suspecting no evil and actually forgetting the precautions i had so long practised suddenly i was brought into the foreground as a sworn foe and natural rival of m m as desperately in love with his wife of which my persecutress vowed and swore that she had proofs saying that only that morning she had seen in the copse but before she had time to finish i broke in at the most desperate minute that minute was so diabolically calculated was so treacherously prepared to lead up to its finale its ludicrous dnouement and was brought out with such killing humour that a perfect outburst of irrepressible mirth saluted this last sally and though even at the time i guessed that mine was not the most unpleasant part in the performance yet i was so confused so irritated and alarmed that full of misery and despair gasping with shame and tears i dashed through two rows of chairs stepped forward and addressing my tormentor cried in a voice broken with tears and indignation arent you ashamed aloud before all the ladies to tell such a wicked lie like a small child before all these men what will they say a big girl like you and married but i could not go on there was a deafening roar of applause my outburst created a perfect furore my nave gesture my tears and especially the fact that i seemed to be defending m m all this provoked such fiendish laughter that even now i cannot help laughing at the mere recollection of it i was overcome with confusion senseless with horror and burning with shame hiding my face in my hands rushed away knocked a tray out of the hands of a footman who was coming in at the door and flew upstairs to my own room i pulled out the key which was on the outside of the door and locked myself in i did well for there was a hue and cry after me before a minute had passed my door was besieged by a mob of the prettiest ladies i heard their ringing laughter their incessant chatter their trilling voices they were all twittering at once like swallows all of them every one of them begged and besought me to open the door if only for a moment swore that no harm should come to me only that they wanted to smother me with kisses but what could be more horrible than this novel threat i simply burned with shame the other side of the door hiding my face in the pillows and did not open did not even respond the ladies kept up their knocking for a long time but i was deaf and obdurate as only a boy of eleven could be but what could i do now everything was laid bare everything had been exposed everything i had so jealously guarded and concealed everlasting disgrace and shame had fallen on me but it is true that i could not myself have said why i was frightened and what i wanted to hide yet i was frightened of something and had trembled like a leaf at the thought of that somethings being discovered only till that minute i had not known what it was whether it was good or bad splendid or shameful praiseworthy or reprehensible now in my distress in the misery that had been forced upon me i learned that it was absurd and shameful instinctively i felt at the same time that this verdict was false inhuman and coarse but i was crushed annihilated consciousness seemed checked in me and thrown into confusion i could not stand up against that verdict nor criticize it properly i was befogged i only felt that my heart had been inhumanly and shamelessly wounded and was brimming over with impotent tears i was irritated but i was boiling with indignation and hate such as i had never felt before for it was the first time in my life that i had known real sorrow insult and injuryand it was truly that without any exaggeration the first untried unformed feeling had been so coarsely handled in me a child the first fragrant virginal modesty had been so soon exposed and insulted and the first and perhaps very real and sthetic impression had been so outraged of course there was much my persecutors did not know and did not divine in my sufferings one circumstance which i had not succeeded in analysing till then of which i had been as it were afraid partly entered into it i went on lying on my bed in despair and misery hiding my face in my pillow and i was alternately feverish and shivery i was tormented by two questions first what had the wretched fair beauty seen and in fact what could she have seen that morning in the copse between mme m and me and secondly how could i now look mme m in the face without dying on the spot of shame and despair an extraordinary noise in the yard roused me at last from the state of semiconsciousness into which i had fallen i got up and went to the window the whole yard was packed with carriages saddlehorses and bustling servants it seemed that they were all setting off some of the gentlemen had already mounted their horses others were taking their places in the carriages then i remembered the expedition to the village fte and little by little an uneasiness came over me i began anxiously looking for my pony in the yard but there was no pony there so they must have forgotten me i could not restrain myself and rushed headlong downstairs thinking no more of unpleasant meetings or my recent ignominy terrible news awaited me there was neither a horse nor seat in any of the carriages to spare for me everything had been arranged all the seats were taken and i was forced to give place to others overwhelmed by this fresh blow i stood on the steps and looked mournfully at the long rows of coaches carriages and chaises in which there was not the tiniest corner left for me and at the smartly dressed ladies whose horses were restlessly curvetting one of the gentlemen was late they were only waiting for his arrival to set off his horse was standing at the door champing the bit pawing the earth with his hoofs and at every moment starting and rearing two stableboys were carefully holding him by the bridle and every one else apprehensively stood at a respectful distance from him a most vexatious circumstance had occurred which prevented my going in addition to the fact that new visitors had arrived filling up all the seats two of the horses had fallen ill one of them being my pony but i was not the only person to suffer it appeared that there was no horse for our new visitor the palefaced young man of whom i have spoken already to get over this difficulty our host had been obliged to have recourse to the extreme step of offering his fiery unbroken stallion adding to satisfy his conscience that it was impossible to ride him and that they had long intended to sell the beast for its vicious character if only a purchaser could be found but in spite of his warning the visitor declared that he was a good horseman and in any case ready to mount anything rather than not go our host said no more but now i fancied that a sly and ambiguous smile was straying on his lips he waited for the gentleman who had spoken so well of his own horsemanship and stood without mounting his horse impatiently rubbing his hands and continually glancing towards the door some similar feeling seemed shared by the two stableboys who were holding the stallion almost breathless with pride at seeing themselves before the whole company in charge of a horse which might any minute kill a man for no reason whatever something akin to their masters sly smile gleamed too in their eyes which were round with expectation and fixed upon the door from which the bold visitor was to appear the horse himself too behaved as though he were in league with our host and the stableboys he bore himself proudly and haughtily as though he felt that he were being watched by several dozen curious eyes and were glorying in his evil reputation exactly as some incorrigible rogue might glory in his criminal exploits he seemed to be defying the bold man who would venture to curb his independence that bold man did at last make his appearance consciencestricken at having kept every one waiting hurriedly drawing on his gloves he came forward without looking at anything ran down the steps and only raised his eyes as he stretched out his hand to seize the mane of the waiting horse but he was at once disconcerted by his frantic rearing and a warning scream from the frightened spectators the young man stepped back and looked in perplexity at the vicious horse which was quivering all over snorting with anger and rolling his bloodshot eyes ferociously continually rearing on his hind legs and flinging up his fore legs as though he meant to bolt into the air and carry the two stableboys with him for a minute the young man stood completely nonplussed then flushing slightly with some embarrassment he raised his eyes and looked at the frightened ladies a very fine horse he said as though to himself and to my thinking it ought to be a great pleasure to ride him but but do you know i think i wont go he concluded turning to our host with the broad goodnatured smile which so suited his kind and clever face yet i consider you are an excellent horseman i assure you answered the owner of the unapproachable horse delighted and he warmly and even gratefully pressed the young mans hand just because from the first moment you saw the sort of brute you had to deal with he added with dignity would you believe me though i have served twentythree years in the hussars yet ive had the pleasure of being laid on the ground three times thanks to that beast that is as often as i mounted the useless animal tancred my boy theres no one here fit for you your rider it seems must be some ilya muromets and he must be sitting quiet now in the village of kapatcharovo waiting for your teeth to fall out come take him away he has frightened people enough it was a waste of time to bring him out he cried rubbing his hands complacently it must be observed that tancred was no sort of use to his master and simply ate corn for nothing moreover the old hussar had lost his reputation for a knowledge of horseflesh by paying a fabulous sum for the worthless beast which he had purchased only for his beauty yet he was delighted now that tancred had kept up his reputation had disposed of another rider and so had drawn closer on himself fresh senseless laurels so you are not going cried the blonde beauty who was particularly anxious that her cavaliere servente should be in attendance on this occasion surely you are not frightened upon my word i am answered the young man are you in earnest why do you want me to break my neck then make haste and get on my horse dont be afraid it is very quiet we wont delay them they can change the saddles in a minute ill try to take yours surely tancred cant always be so unruly no sooner said than done the madcap leaped out of the saddle and was standing before us as she finished the last sentence you dont know tancred if you think he will allow your wretched sidesaddle to be put on him besides i would not let you break your neck it would be a pity said our host at that moment of inward gratification affecting as his habit was a studied brusqueness and even coarseness of speech which he thought in keeping with a jolly good fellow and an old soldier and which he imagined to be particularly attractive to the ladies this was one of his favourite fancies his favourite whim with which we were all familiar well crybaby wouldnt you like to have a try you wanted so much to go said the valiant horsewoman noticing me and pointing tauntingly at tancred because i had been so imprudent as to catch her eye and she would not let me go without a biting word that she might not have dismounted from her horse absolutely for nothing i expect you are not such a we all know you are a hero and would be ashamed to be afraid especially when you will be looked at you fine page she added with a fleeting glance at mme m whose carriage was the nearest to the entrance a rush of hatred and vengeance had flooded my heart when the fair amazon had approached us with the intention of mounting tancred but i cannot describe what i felt at this unexpected challenge from the madcap everything was dark before my eyes when i saw her glance at mme m for an instant an idea flashed through my mind but it was only a moment less than a moment like a flash of gunpowder perhaps it was the last straw and i suddenly now was moved to rage as my spirit rose so that i longed to put all my enemies to utter confusion and to revenge myself on all of them and before everyone by showing the sort of person i was or whether by some miracle some prompting from medival history of which i had known nothing till then sent whirling through my giddy brain images of tournaments paladins heroes lovely ladies the clash of swords shouts and the applause of the crowd and amidst those shouts the timid cry of a frightened heart which moves the proud soul more sweetly than victory and famei dont know whether all this romantic nonsense was in my head at the time or whether more likely only the first dawning of the inevitable nonsense that was in store for me in the future anyway i felt that my hour had come my heart leaped and shuddered and i dont remember how at one bound i was down the steps and beside tancred you think i am afraid i cried boldly and proudly in such a fever that i could hardly see breathless with excitement and flushing till the tears scalded my cheeks well you shall see and clutching at tancreds mane i put my foot in the stirrup before they had time to make a movement to stop me but at that instant tancred reared jerked his head and with a mighty bound forward wrenched himself out of the hands of the petrified stableboys and dashed off like a hurricane while every one cried out in horror goodness knows how i got my other leg over the horse while it was in full gallop i cant imagine either how i did not lose hold of the reins tancred bore me beyond the trellis gate turned sharply to the right and flew along beside the fence regardless of the road only at that moment i heard behind me a shout from fifty voices and that shout was echoed in my swooning heart with such a feeling of pride and pleasure that i shall never forget that mad moment of my boyhood all the blood rushed to my head bewildering me and overpowering my fears i was beside myself there certainly was as i remember it now something of the knighterrant about the exploit my knightly exploits however were all over in an instant or it would have gone badly with the knight and indeed i do not know how i escaped as it was i did know how to ride i had been taught but my pony was more like a sheep than a riding horse no doubt i should have been thrown off tancred if he had had time to throw me but after galloping fifty paces he suddenly took fright at a huge stone which lay across the road and bolted back he turned sharply galloping at full speed so that it is a puzzle to me even now that i was not sent spinning out of the saddle and flying like a ball for twenty feet that i was not dashed to pieces and that tancred did not dislocate his leg by such a sudden turn he rushed back to the gate tossing his head furiously bounding from side to side as though drunk with rage flinging his legs at random in the air and at every leap trying to shake me off his back as though a tiger had leaped on him and were thrusting its teeth and claws into his back in another instant i should have flown off i was falling but several gentlemen flew to my rescue two of them intercepted the way into the open country two others galloped up closing in upon tancred so that their horses sides almost crushed my legs and both of them caught him by the bridle a few seconds later we were back at the steps they lifted me down from the horse pale and scarcely breathing i was shaking like a blade of grass in the wind it was the same with tancred who was standing his hoofs as it were thrust into the earth and his whole body thrown back puffing his fiery breath from red and streaming nostrils twitching and quivering all over seeming overwhelmed with wounded pride and anger at a childs being so bold with impunity all around me i heard cries of bewilderment surprise and alarm at that moment my straying eyes caught those of mme m who looked pale and agitated andi can never forget that momentin one instant my face was flooded with colour glowed and burned like fire i dont know what happened to me but confused and frightened by my own feelings i timidly dropped my eyes to the ground but my glance was noticed it was caught it was stolen from me all eyes turned on mme m and finding herself unawares the centre of attention she too flushed like a child from some nave and involuntary feeling and made an unsuccessful effort to cover her confusion by laughing all this of course was very absurdlooking from outside but at that moment an extremely nave and unexpected circumstance saved me from being laughed at by every one and gave a special colour to the whole adventure the lovely persecutor who was the instigator of the whole escapade and who till then had been my irreconcileable foe suddenly rushed up to embrace and kiss me she had hardly been able to believe her eyes when she saw me dare to accept her challenge and pick up the gauntlet she had flung at me by glancing at mme m she had almost died of terror and selfreproach when i had flown off on tancred now when it was all over and particularly when she caught the glance at mme m my confusion and my sudden flush of colour when the romantic strain in her frivolous little head had given a new secret unspoken significance to the momentshe was moved to such enthusiasm over my knightliness that touched joyful and proud of me she rushed up and pressed me to her bosom she lifted the most nave sternlooking little face on which there quivered and gleamed two little crystal tears and gazing at the crowd that thronged about her said in a grave earnest voice such as they had never heard her use before pointing to me mais cest trs srieux messieurs ne riez pas she did not notice that all were standing as though fascinated admiring her bright enthusiasm her swift unexpected action her earnest little face the simplehearted navet the unexpected feeling betrayed by the tears that welled in her invariably laughterloving eyes were such a surprise that every one stood before her as though electrified by her expression her rapid fiery words and gestures it seemed as though no one could take his eyes off her for fear of missing that rare moment in her enthusiastic face even our host flushed crimson as a tulip and people declared that they heard him confess afterwards that to his shame he had been in love for a whole minute with his charming guest well of course after this i was a knight a hero de lorge toggenburg was heard in the crowd there was a sound of applause hurrah for the rising generation added the host but he is coming with us he certainly must come with us said the beauty we will find him a place we must find him a place he shall sit beside me on my knee but no no thats a mistake she corrected herself laughing unable to restrain her mirth at our first encounter but as she laughed she stroked my hand tenderly doing all she could to soften me that i might not be offended of course of course several voices chimed in he must go he has won his place the matter was settled in a trice the same old maid who had brought about my acquaintance with the blonde beauty was at once besieged with entreaties from all the younger people to remain at home and let me have her seat she was forced to consent to her intense vexation with a smile and a stealthy hiss of anger her protectress who was her usual refuge my former foe and new friend called to her as she galloped off on her spirited horse laughing like a child that she envied her and would have been glad to stay at home herself for it was just going to rain and we should all get soaked and she was right in predicting rain a regular downpour came on within an hour and the expedition was done for we had to take shelter for some hours in the huts of the village and had to return home between nine and ten in the evening in the damp mist that followed the rain i began to be a little feverish at the minute when i was starting mme m came up to me and expressed surprise that my neck was uncovered and that i had nothing on over my jacket i answered that i had not had time to get my coat she took out a pin and pinned up the turned down collar of my shirt took off her own neck a crimson gauze kerchief and put it round my neck that i might not get a sore throat she did this so hurriedly that i had not time even to thank her but when we got home i found her in the little drawingroom with the blonde beauty and the palefaced young man who had gained glory for horsemanship that day by refusing to ride tancred i went up to thank her and give back the scarf but now after all my adventures i felt somehow ashamed i wanted to make haste and get upstairs there at my leisure to reflect and consider i was brimming over with impressions as i gave back the kerchief i blushed up to my ears as usual i bet he would like to keep the kerchief said the young man laughing one can see that he is sorry to part with your scarf thats it thats it the fair lady put in what a boy oh she said shaking her head with obvious vexation but she stopped in time at a grave glance from mme m who did not want to carry the jest too far i made haste to get away well you are a boy said the madcap overtaking me in the next room and affectionately taking me by both hands why you should have simply not returned the kerchief if you wanted so much to have it you should have said you put it down somewhere and that would have been the end of it what a simpleton couldnt even do that what a funny boy and she tapped me on the chin with her finger laughing at my having flushed as red as a poppy i am your friend now you know am i not our enmity is over isnt it yes or no i laughed and pressed her fingers without a word oh why are you so why are you so pale and shivering have you caught a chill yes i dont feel well ah poor fellow thats the result of overexcitement do you know what you had better go to bed without sitting up for supper and you will be all right in the morning come along she took me upstairs and there was no end to the care she lavished on me leaving me to undress she ran downstairs got me some tea and brought it up herself when i was in bed she brought me up a warm quilt as well i was much impressed and touched by all the care and attention lavished on me or perhaps i was affected by the whole day the expedition and feverishness as i said goodnight to her i hugged her warmly as though she were my dearest and nearest friend and in my exhausted state all the emotions of the day came back to me in a rush i almost shed tears as i nestled to her bosom she noticed my overwrought condition and i believe my madcap herself was a little touched you are a very good boy she said looking at me with gentle eyes please dont be angry with me you wont will you in fact we became the warmest and truest of friends it was rather early when i woke up but the sun was already flooding the whole room with brilliant light i jumped out of bed feeling perfectly well and strong as though i had had no fever the day before indeed i felt now unutterably joyful i recalled the previous day and felt that i would have given any happiness if i could at that minute have embraced my new friend the fairhaired beauty again as i had the night before but it was very early and every one was still asleep hurriedly dressing i went out into the garden and from there into the copse i made my way where the leaves were thickest where the fragrance of the trees was more resinous and where the sun peeped in most gaily rejoicing that it could penetrate the dense darkness of the foliage it was a lovely morning going on further and further before i was aware of it i had reached the further end of the copse and came out on the river moskva it flowed at the bottom of the hill two hundred paces below on the opposite bank of the river they were mowing i watched whole rows of sharp scythes gleam all together in the sunlight at every swing of the mower and then vanish again like little fiery snakes going into hiding i watched the cut grass flying on one side in dense rich swathes and being laid in long straight lines i dont know how long i spent in contemplation at last i was roused from my reverie by hearing a horse snorting and impatiently pawing the ground twenty paces from me in the track which ran from the high road to the manor house i dont know whether i heard this horse as soon as the rider rode up and stopped there or whether the sound had long been in my ears without rousing me from my dreaming moved by curiosity i went into the copse and before i had gone many steps i caught the sound of voices speaking rapidly though in subdued tones i went up closer carefully parting the branches of the bushes that edged the path and at once sprang back in amazement i caught a glimpse of a familiar white dress and a soft feminine voice resounded like music in my heart it was mme m she was standing beside a man on horseback who stooping down from the saddle was hurriedly talking to her and to my amazement i recognized him as n the young man who had gone away the morning before and over whose departure m m had been so busy but people had said at the time that he was going far away to somewhere in the south of russia and so i was very much surprised at seeing him with us again so early and alone with mme m she was moved and agitated as i had never seen her before and tears were glistening on her cheeks the young man was holding her hand and stooping down to kiss it i had come upon them at the moment of parting they seemed to be in haste at last he took out of his pocket a sealed envelope gave it to mme m put one arm round her still not dismounting and gave her a long fervent kiss a minute later he lashed his horse and flew past me like an arrow mme m looked after him for some moments then pensively and disconsolately turned homewards but after going a few steps along the track she seemed suddenly to recollect herself hurriedly parted the bushes and walked on through the copse i followed her surprised and perplexed by all that i had seen my heart was beating violently as though from terror i was as it were benumbed and befogged my ideas were shattered and turned upside down but i remember i was for some reason very sad i got glimpses from time to time through the green foliage of her white dress before me i followed her mechanically never losing sight of her though i trembled at the thought that she might notice me at last she came out on the little path that led to the house after waiting half a minute i too emerged from the bushes but what was my amazement when i saw lying on the red sand of the path a sealed packet which i recognized from the first glance as the one that had been given to mme m ten minutes before i picked it up on both sides the paper was blank there was no address on it the envelope was not large but it was fat and heavy as though there were three or more sheets of notepaper in it what was the meaning of this envelope no doubt it would explain the whole mystery perhaps in it there was said all that n had scarcely hoped to express in their brief hurried interview he had not even dismounted whether he had been in haste or whether he had been afraid of being false to himself at the hour of partinggod only knows i stopped without coming out on the path threw the envelope in the most conspicuous place on it and kept my eyes upon it supposing that mme m would notice the loss and come back and look for it but after waiting four minutes i could stand it no longer i picked up my find again put it in my pocket and set off to overtake mme m i came upon her in the big avenue in the garden she was walking straight towards the house with a swift and hurried step though she was lost in thought and her eyes were on the ground i did not know what to do go up to her give it her that would be as good as saying that i knew everything that i had seen it all i should betray myself at the first word and how should i look at her how would she look at me i kept expecting that she would discover her loss and return on her tracks then i could unnoticed have flung the envelope on the path and she would have found it but no we were approaching the house she had already been noticed as illluck would have it every one had got up very early that day because after the unsuccessful expedition of the evening before they had arranged something new of which i had heard nothing all were preparing to set off and were having breakfast in the verandah i waited for ten minutes that i might not be seen with mme m and making a circuit of the garden approached the house from the other side a long time after her she was walking up and down the verandah with her arms folded looking pale and agitated and was obviously trying her utmost to suppress the agonizing despairing misery which could be plainly discerned in her eyes her walk her every movement sometimes she went down the verandah steps and walked a few paces among the flowerbeds in the direction of the garden her eyes were impatiently greedily even incautiously seeking something on the sand of the path and on the floor of the verandah there could be no doubt she had discovered her loss and imagined she had dropped the letter somewhere here near the houseyes that must be so she was convinced of it some one noticed that she was pale and agitated and others made the same remark she was besieged with questions about her health and condolences she had to laugh to jest to appear lively from time to time she looked at her husband who was standing at the end of the terrace talking to two ladies and the poor woman was overcome by the same shudder the same embarrassment as on the day of his first arrival thrusting my hand into my pocket and holding the letter tight in it i stood at a little distance from them all praying to fate that mme m should notice me i longed to cheer her up to relieve her anxiety if only by a glance to say a word to her on the sly but when she did chance to look at me i dropped my eyes i saw her distress and i was not mistaken to this day i dont know her secret i know nothing but what i saw and what i have just described the intrigue was not such perhaps as one might suppose at the first glance perhaps that kiss was the kiss of farewell perhaps it was the last slight reward for the sacrifice made to her peace and honour n was going away he was leaving her perhaps for ever even that letter i was holding in my handwho can tell what it contained how can one judge and who can condemn and yet there is no doubt that the sudden discovery of her secret would have been terriblewould have been a fatal blow for her i still remember her face at that minute it could not have shown more suffering to feel to know to be convinced to expect as though it were ones execution that in a quarter of an hour in a minute perhaps all might be discovered the letter might be found by some one picked up there was no address on it it might be opened and then what then what torture could be worse than what was awaiting her she moved about among those who would be her judges in another minute their smiling flattering faces would be menacing and merciless she would read mockery malice and icy contempt on those faces and then her life would be plunged in everlasting darkness with no dawn to follow yes i did not understand it then as i understand it now i could only have vague suspicions and misgivings and a heartache at the thought of her danger which i could not fully understand but whatever lay hidden in her secret much was expiated if expiation were needed by those moments of anguish of which i was witness and which i shall never forget but then came a cheerful summons to set off immediately every one was bustling about gaily laughter and lively chatter were heard on all sides within two minutes the verandah was deserted mme m declined to join the party acknowledging at last that she was not well but thank god all the others set off every one was in haste and there was no time to worry her with commiseration inquiries and advice a few remained at home her husband said a few words to her she answered that she would be all right directly that he need not be uneasy that there was no occasion for her to lie down that she would go into the garden alone with me here she glanced at me nothing could be more fortunate i flushed with pleasure with delight a minute later we were on the way she walked along the same avenues and paths by which she had returned from the copse instinctively remembering the way she had come gazing before her with her eyes fixed on the ground looking about intently without answering me possibly forgetting that i was walking beside her but when we had already reached the place where i had picked up the letter and the path ended mme m suddenly stopped and in a voice faint and weak with misery said that she felt worse and that she would go home but when she reached the garden fence she stopped again and thought a minute a smile of despair came on her lips and utterly worn out and exhausted resigned and making up her mind to the worst she turned without a word and retraced her steps even forgetting to tell me of her intention my heart was torn with sympathy and i did not know what to do we went or rather i led her to the place from which an hour before i had heard the tramp of a horse and their conversation here close to a shady elm tree was a seat hewn out of one huge stone about which grew ivy wild jasmine and dogrose the whole wood was dotted with little bridges arbours grottoes and similar surprises mme m sat down on the bench and glanced unconsciously at the marvellous view that lay open before us a minute later she opened her book and fixed her eyes upon it without reading without turning the pages almost unconscious of what she was doing it was about halfpast nine the sun was already high and was floating gloriously in the deep dark blue sky as though melting away in its own light the mowers were by now far away they were scarcely visible from our side of the river endless ridges of mown grass crept after them in unbroken succession and from time to time the faintly stirring breeze wafted their fragrance to us the never ceasing concert of those who sow not neither do they reap and are free as the air they cleave with their sportive wings was all about us it seemed as though at that moment every flower every blade of grass was exhaling the aroma of sacrifice was saying to its creator father i am blessed and happy i glanced at the poor woman who alone was like one dead amidst all this joyous life two big tears hung motionless on her lashes wrung from her heart by bitter grief it was in my power to relieve and console this poor fainting heart only i did not know how to approach the subject how to take the first step i was in agonies a hundred times i was on the point of going up to her but every time my face glowed like fire suddenly a bright idea dawned upon me i had found a way of doing it i revived would you like me to pick you a nosegay i said in such a joyful voice that mme m immediately raised her head and looked at me intently yes do she said at last in a weak voice with a faint smile at once dropping her eyes on the book again or soon they will be mowing the grass here and there will be no flowers i cried eagerly setting to work i had soon picked my nosegay a poor simple one i should have been ashamed to take it indoors but how light my heart was as i picked the flowers and tied them up the dogrose and the wild jasmine i picked closer to the seat i knew that not far off there was a field of rye not yet ripe i ran there for cornflowers i mixed them with tall ears of rye picking out the finest and most golden close by i came upon a perfect nest of forgetmenots and my nosegay was almost complete farther away in the meadow there were darkblue campanulas and wild pinks and i ran down to the very edge of the river to get yellow waterlilies at last making my way back and going for an instant into the wood to get some bright green fanshaped leaves of the maple to put round the nosegay i happened to come across a whole family of pansies close to which luckily for me the fragrant scent of violets betrayed the little flower hiding in the thick lush grass and still glistening with drops of dew the nosegay was complete i bound it round with fine long grass which twisted into a rope and i carefully lay the letter in the centre hiding it with the flowers but in such a way that it could be very easily noticed if the slightest attention were bestowed upon my nosegay i carried it to mme m on the way it seemed to me that the letter was lying too much in view i hid it a little more as i got nearer i thrust it still further in the flowers and finally when i was on the spot i suddenly poked it so deeply into the centre of the nosegay that it could not be noticed at all from outside my cheeks were positively flaming i wanted to hide my face in my hands and run away at once but she glanced at my flowers as though she had completely forgotten that i had gathered them mechanically almost without looking she held out her hand and took my present but at once laid it on the seat as though i had handed it to her for that purpose and dropped her eyes to her book again seeming lost in thought i was ready to cry at this mischance if only my nosegay were close to her i thought if only she had not forgotten it i lay down on the grass not far off put my right arm under my head and closed my eyes as though i were overcome by drowsiness but i waited keeping my eyes fixed on her ten minutes passed it seemed to me that she was getting paler and paler fortunately a blessed chance came to my aid this was a big golden bee brought by a kindly breeze luckily for me it first buzzed over my head and then flew up to mme m she waved it off once or twice but the bee grew more and more persistent at last mme m snatched up my nosegay and waved it before my face at that instant the letter dropped out from among the flowers and fell straight upon the open book i started for some time mme m mute with amazement stared first at the letter and then at the flowers which she was holding in her hands and she seemed unable to believe her eyes all at once she flushed started and glanced at me but i caught her movement and i shut my eyes tight pretending to be asleep nothing would have induced me to look her straight in the face at that moment my heart was throbbing and leaping like a bird in the grasp of some village boy i dont remember how long i lay with my eyes shut two or three minutes at last i ventured to open them mme m was greedily reading the letter and from her glowing cheeks her sparkling tearful eyes her bright face every feature of which was quivering with joyful emotion i guessed that there was happiness in the letter and all her misery was dispersed like smoke an agonizing sweet feeling gnawed at my heart it was hard for me to go on pretending i shall never forget that minute suddenly a long way off we heard voices mme m natalie natalie mme m did not answer but she got up quickly from the seat came up to me and bent over me i felt that she was looking straight into my face my eyelashes quivered but i controlled myself and did not open my eyes i tried to breathe more evenly and quietly but my heart smothered me with its violent throbbing her burning breath scorched my cheeks she bent close down to my face as though trying to make sure at last a kiss and tears fell on my hand the one which was lying on my breast natalie natalie where are you we heard again this time quite close coming said mme m in her mellow silvery voice which was so choked and quivering with tears and so subdued that no one but i could hear that coming but at that instant my heart at last betrayed me and seemed to send all my blood rushing to my face at that instant a swift burning kiss scalded my lips i uttered a faint cry i opened my eyes but at once the same gauze kerchief fell upon them as though she meant to screen me from the sun an instant later she was gone i heard nothing but the sound of rapidly retreating steps i was alone i pulled off her kerchief and kissed it beside myself with rapture for some moments i was almost frantic hardly able to breathe leaning on my elbow on the grass i stared unconsciously before me at the surrounding slopes streaked with cornfields at the river that flowed twisting and winding far away as far as the eye could see between fresh hills and villages that gleamed like dots all over the sunlit distanceat the darkblue hardly visible forests which seemed as though smoking at the edge of the burning sky and a sweet stillness inspired by the triumphant peacefulness of the picture gradually brought calm to my troubled heart i felt more at ease and breathed more freely but my whole soul was full of a dumb sweet yearning as though a veil had been drawn from my eyes as though at a foretaste of something my frightened heart faintly quivering with expectation was groping timidly and joyfully towards some conjecture and all at once my bosom heaved began aching as though something had pierced it and tears sweet tears gushed from my eyes i hid my face in my hands and quivering like a blade of grass gave myself up to the first consciousness and revelation of my heart the first vague glimpse of my nature my childhood was over from that moment when two hours later i returned home i did not find mme m through some sudden chance she had gone back to moscow with her husband i never saw her again mr prohartchin a story in the darkest and humblest corner of ustinya fyodorovnas flat lived semyon ivanovitch prohartchin a wellmeaning elderly man who did not drink since mr prohartchin was of a very humble grade in the service and received a salary strictly proportionate to his official capacity ustinya fyodorovna could not get more than five roubles a month from him for his lodging some people said that she had her own reasons for accepting him as a lodger but be that as it may as though in despite of all his detractors mr prohartchin actually became her favourite in an honourable and virtuous sense of course it must be observed that ustinya fyodorovna a very respectable woman who had a special partiality for meat and coffee and found it difficult to keep the fasts let rooms to several other boarders who paid twice as much as semyon ivanovitch yet not being quiet lodgers but on the contrary all of them spiteful scoffers at her feminine ways and her forlorn helplessness stood very low in her good opinion so that if it had not been for the rent they paid she would not have cared to let them stay nor indeed to see them in her flat at all semyon ivanovitch had become her favourite from the day when a retired or perhaps more correctly speaking discharged clerk with a weakness for strong drink was carried to his last restingplace in volkovo though this gentleman had only one eye having had the other knocked out owing in his own words to his valiant behaviour and only one leg the other having been broken in the same way owing to his valour yet he had succeeded in winning all the kindly feeling of which ustinya fyodorovna was capable and took the fullest advantage of it and would probably have gone on for years living as her devoted satellite and toady if he had not finally drunk himself to death in the most pitiable way all this had happened at peski where ustinya fyodorovna only had three lodgers of whom when she moved into a new flat and set up on a larger scale letting to about a dozen new boarders mr prohartchin was the only one who remained whether mr prohartchin had certain incorrigible defects or whether his companions were every one of them to blame there seemed to be misunderstandings on both sides from the first we must observe here that all ustinya fyodorovnas new lodgers without exception got on together like brothers some of them were in the same office each one of them by turns lost all his money to the others at faro preference and bixe they all liked in a merry hour to enjoy what they called the fizzing moments of life in a crowd together they were fond too at times of discussing lofty subjects and though in the end things rarely passed off without a dispute yet as all prejudices were banished from the whole party the general harmony was not in the least disturbed thereby the most remarkable among the lodgers were mark ivanovitch an intelligent and wellread man then oplevaniev then prepolovenko also a nice and modest person then there was a certain zinovy prokofyevitch whose object in life was to get into aristocratic society then there was okeanov the copying clerk who had in his time almost wrested the distinction of prime favourite from semyon ivanovitch then another copying clerk called sudbin the plebeian kantarev there were others too but to all these people semyon ivanovitch was as it were not one of themselves no one wished him harm of course for all had from the very first done prohartchin justice and had decided in mark ivanovitchs words that he prohartchin was a good and harmless fellow though by no means a man of the world trustworthy and not a flatterer who had of course his failings but that if he were sometimes unhappy it was due to nothing else but lack of imagination what is more mr prohartchin though deprived in this way of imagination could never have made a particularly favourable impression from his figure or manners upon which scoffers are fond of fastening yet his figure did not put people against him mark ivanovitch who was an intelligent person formally undertook semyon ivanovitchs defence and declared in rather happy and flowery language that prohartchin was an elderly and respectable man who had long long ago passed the age of romance and so if semyon ivanovitch did not know how to get on with people it must have been entirely his own fault the first thing they noticed was the unmistakable parsimony and niggardliness of semyon ivanovitch that was at once observed and noted for semyon ivanovitch would never lend any one his teapot even for a moment and that was the more unjust as he himself hardly ever drank tea but when he wanted anything drank as a rule rather a pleasant decoction of wild flowers and certain medicinal herbs of which he always had a considerable store his meals too were quite different from the other lodgers he never for instance permitted himself to partake of the whole dinner provided daily by ustinya fyodorovna for the other boarders the dinner cost half a rouble semyon ivanovitch paid only twentyfive kopecks in copper and never exceeded it and so took either a plate of soup with pie or a plate of beef most frequently he ate neither soup nor beef but he partook in moderation of white bread with onion curd salted cucumber or something similar which was a great deal cheaper and he would only go back to his half rouble dinner when he could stand it no longer here the biographer confesses that nothing would have induced him to allude to such realistic and low details positively shocking and offensive to some lovers of the heroic style if it were not that these details exhibit one peculiarity one characteristic in the hero of this story for mr prohartchin was by no means so poor as to be unable to have regular and sufficient meals though he sometimes made out that he was but he acted as he did regardless of obloquy and peoples prejudices simply to satisfy his strange whims and from frugality and excessive carefulness all this however will be much clearer later on but we will beware of boring the reader with the description of all semyon ivanovitchs whims and will omit for instance the curious and very amusing description of his attire and in fact if it were not for ustinya fyodorovnas own reference to it we should hardly have alluded even to the fact that semyon ivanovitch never could make up his mind to send his linen to the wash or if he ever did so it was so rarely that in the intervals one might have completely forgotten the existence of linen on semyon ivanovitch from the landladys evidence it appeared that semyon ivanovitch bless his soul poor lamb for twenty years had been tucked away in his corner without caring what folks thought for all the days of his life on earth he was a stranger to socks handkerchiefs and all such things and what is more ustinya fyodorovna had seen with her own eyes thanks to the decrepitude of the screen that the poor dear man sometimes had had nothing to cover his bare skin such were the rumours in circulation after semyon ivanovitchs death but in his lifetime and this was one of the most frequent occasions of dissension he could not endure it if any one even somebody on friendly terms with him poked his inquisitive nose uninvited into his corner even through an aperture in the decrepit screen he was a taciturn man difficult to deal with and prone to ill health he did not like people to give him advice he did not care for people who put themselves forward either and if any one jeered at him or gave him advice unasked he would fall foul of him at once put him to shame and settle his business you are a puppy you are a featherhead you are not one to give advice so thereyou mind your own business sir youd better count the stitches in your own socks sir so there semyon ivanovitch was a plain man and never used the formal mode of address to any one he could not bear it either when some one who knew his little ways would begin from pure sport pestering him with questions such as what he had in his little trunk semyon ivanovitch had one little trunk it stood under his bed and was guarded like the apple of his eye and though every one knew that there was nothing in it except old rags two or three pairs of damaged boots and all sorts of rubbish yet mr prohartchin prized his property very highly and they used even to hear him at one time express dissatisfaction with his old but still sound lock and talk of getting a new one of a special german pattern with a secret spring and various complications when on one occasion zinovy prokofyevitch carried away by the thoughtlessness of youth gave expression to the very coarse and unseemly idea that semyon ivanovitch was probably hiding and treasuring something in his box to leave to his descendants every one who happened to be by was stupefied at the extraordinary effects of zinovy prokofyevitchs sally at first mr prohartchin could not find suitable terms for such a crude and coarse idea for a long time words dropped from his lips quite incoherently and it was only after a while they made out that semyon ivanovitch was reproaching zinovy prokofyevitch for some shabby action in the remote past then they realized that semyon ivanovitch was predicting that zinovy prokofyevitch would never get into aristocratic society and that the tailor to whom he owed a bill for his suits would beat himwould certainly beat himbecause the puppy had not paid him for so long and finally you puppy you semyon ivanovitch added here you want to get into the hussars but you wont i tell you youll make a fool of yourself and i tell you what you puppy when your superiors know all about it they will take and make you a copying clerk so that will be the end of it do you hear puppy then semyon ivanovitch subsided but after lying down for five hours to the intense astonishment of every one he seemed to have reached a decision and began suddenly reproaching and abusing the young man again at first to himself and afterwards addressing zinovy prokofyevitch but the matter did not end there and in the evening when mark ivanovitch and prepolovenko made tea and asked okeanov to drink it with them semyon ivanovitch got up from his bed purposely joined them subscribing his fifteen or twenty kopecks and on the pretext of a sudden desire for a cup of tea began at great length going into the subject and explaining that he was a poor man nothing but a poor man and that a poor man like him had nothing to save mr prohartchin confessed that he was a poor man on this occasion he said simply because the subject had come up that the day before yesterday he had meant to borrow a rouble from that impudent fellow but now he should not borrow it for fear the puppy should brag that that was the fact of the matter and that his salary was such that one could not buy enough to eat and that finally a poor man as you see he sent his sisterinlaw in tver five roubles every month that if he did not send his sisterinlaw in tver five roubles every month his sisterinlaw would die and if his sisterinlaw who was dependent on him were dead he semyon ivanovitch would long ago have bought himself a new suit and semyon ivanovitch went on talking in this way at great length about being a poor man about his sisterinlaw and about roubles and kept repeating the same thing over and over again to impress it on his audience till he got into a regular muddle and relapsed into silence only three days later when they had all forgotten about him and no one was thinking of attacking him he added something in conclusion to the effect that when zinovy prokofyevitch went into the hussars the impudent fellow would have his leg cut off in the war and then he would come with a wooden leg and say semyon ivanovitch kind friend give me something to eat and then semyon ivanovitch would not give him something to eat and would not look at the insolent fellow and thats how it would be and he could just make the best of it all this naturally seemed very curious and at the same time fearfully amusing without much reflection all the lodgers joined together for further investigation and simply from curiosity determined to make a final onslaught on semyon ivanovitch en masse and as mr prohartchin too had of latethat is ever since he had begun living in the same flat with thembeen very fond of finding out everything about them and asking inquisitive questions probably for private reasons of his own relations sprang up between the opposed parties without any preparation or effort on either side as it were by chance and of itself to get into relations semyon ivanovitch always had in reserve his peculiar rather sly and very ingenuous manoeuvre of which the reader has learned something already he would get off his bed about teatime and if he saw the others gathered together in a group to make tea he would go up to them like a quiet sensible and friendly person hand over his twenty kopecks as he was entitled to do and announce that he wished to join them then the young men would wink at one another and so indicating that they were in league together against semyon ivanovitch would begin a conversation at first strictly proper and decorous then one of the wittier of the party would propos of nothing fall to telling them news consisting most usually of entirely false and quite incredible details he would say for instance that some one had heard his excellency that day telling demid vassilyevitch that in his opinion married clerks were more trustworthy than unmarried and more suitable for promotion for they were steady and that their capacities were considerably improved by marriage and that therefore hethat is the speakerin order to improve and be better fitted for promotion was doing his utmost to enter the bonds of matrimony as soon as possible with a certain fevronya prokofyevna or he would say that it had more than once been remarked about certain of his colleagues that they were entirely devoid of social graces and of wellbred agreeable manners and consequently unable to please ladies in good society and that therefore to eradicate this defect it would be suitable to deduct something from their salary and with the sum so obtained to hire a hall where they could learn to dance acquire the outward signs of gentlemanliness and goodbreeding courtesy respect for their seniors strength of will a good and grateful heart and various agreeable qualities or he would say that it was being arranged that some of the clerks beginning with the most elderly were to be put through an examination in all sorts of subjects to raise their standard of culture and in that way the speaker would add all sorts of things would come to light and certain gentlemen would have to lay their cards on the tablein short thousands of similar very absurd rumours were discussed to keep it up every one believed the story at once showed interest in it asked questions applied it to themselves and some of them assuming a despondent air began shaking their heads and asking every ones advice saying what were they to do if they were to come under it it need hardly be said that a man far less credulous and simplehearted than mr prohartchin would have been puzzled and carried away by a rumour so unanimously believed moreover from all appearances it might be safely concluded that semyon ivanovitch was exceedingly stupid and slow to grasp any new unusual idea and that when he heard anything new he had always first as it were to chew it over and digest it to find out the meaning and struggling with it in bewilderment at last perhaps to overcome it though even then in a quite special manner peculiar to himself alone in this way curious and hitherto unexpected qualities began to show themselves in semyon ivanovitch talk and tittletattle followed and by devious ways it all reached the office at last with additions what increased the sensation was the fact that mr prohartchin who had looked almost exactly the same from time immemorial suddenly propos of nothing wore quite a different countenance his face was uneasy his eyes were timid and had a scared and rather suspicious expression he took to walking softly starting and listening and to put the finishing touch to his new characteristics developed a passion for investigating the truth he carried his love of truth at last to such a pitch as to venture on two occasions to inquire of demid vassilyevitch himself concerning the credibility of the strange rumours that reached him daily by dozens and if we say nothing here of the consequence of the action of semyon ivanovitch it is for no other reason but a sensitive regard for his reputation it was in this way people came to consider him as misanthropic and regardless of the proprieties then they began to discover that there was a great deal that was fantastical about him and in this they were not altogether mistaken for it was observed on more than one occasion that semyon ivanovitch completely forgot himself and sitting in his seat with his mouth open and his pen in the air as though frozen or petrified looked more like the shadow of a rational being than that rational being itself it sometimes happened that some innocently gaping gentleman on suddenly catching his straying lustreless questioning eyes was scared and all of a tremor and at once inserted into some important document either a smudge or some quite inappropriate word the impropriety of semyon ivanovitchs behaviour embarrassed and annoyed all really wellbred people at last no one could feel any doubt of the eccentricity of semyon ivanovitchs mind when one fine morning the rumour was all over the office that mr prohartchin had actually frightened demid vassilyevitch himself for meeting him in the corridor semyon ivanovitch had been so strange and peculiar that he had forced his superior to beat a retreat the news of semyon ivanovitchs behaviour reached him himself at last hearing of it he got up at once made his way carefully between the chairs and tables reached the entry took down his overcoat with his own hand put it on went out and disappeared for an indefinite period whether he was led into this by alarm or some other impulse we cannot say but no trace was seen of him for a time either at home or at the office we will not attribute semyon ivanovitchs fate simply to his eccentricity yet we must observe to the reader that our hero was a very retiring man unaccustomed to society and had until he made the acquaintance of the new lodgers lived in complete unbroken solitude and had been marked by his quietness and even a certain mysteriousness for he had spent all the time that he lodged at peski lying on his bed behind the screen without talking or having any sort of relations with any one both his old fellowlodgers lived exactly as he did they too were somehow mysterious people and spent fifteen years lying behind their screens the happy drowsy hours and days trailed by one after the other in patriarchal stagnation and as everything around them went its way in the same happy fashion neither semyon ivanovitch nor ustinya fyodorovna could remember exactly when fate had brought them together it may be ten years it may be twenty it may be even twentyfive altogether she would say at times to her new lodgers since he settled with me poor dear man bless his heart and so it was very natural that the hero of our story being so unaccustomed to society was disagreeably surprised when a year before he a respectable and modest man had found himself suddenly in the midst of a noisy and boisterous crew consisting of a dozen young fellows his colleagues at the office and his new housemates the disappearance of semyon ivanovitch made no little stir in the lodgings one thing was that he was the favourite another that his passport which had been in the landladys keeping appeared to have been accidentally mislaid ustinya fyodorovna raised a howl as was her invariable habit on all critical occasions she spent two days in abusing and upbraiding the lodgers she wailed that they had chased away her lodger like a chicken and all those spiteful scoffers had been the ruin of him and on the third day she sent them all out to hunt for the fugitive and at all costs to bring him back dead or alive towards evening sudbin first came back with the news that traces had been discovered that he had himself seen the runaway in tolkutchy market and other places had followed and stood close to him but had not dared to speak to him he had been near him in a crowd watching a house on fire in crooked lane half an hour later okeanov and kantarev came in and confirmed sudbins story word for word they too had stood near had followed him quite close had stood not more than ten paces from him but they also had not ventured to speak to him but both observed that semyon ivanovitch was walking with a drunken cadger the other lodgers were all back and together at last and after listening attentively they made up their minds that prohartchin could not be far off and would not be long in returning but they said that they had all known beforehand that he was about with a drunken cadger this drunken cadger was a thoroughly bad lot insolent and cringing and it seemed evident that he had got round semyon ivanovitch in some way he had turned up just a week before semyon ivanovitchs disappearance in company with remnev had spent a little time in the flat telling them that he had suffered in the cause of justice that he had formerly been in the service in the provinces that an inspector had come down on them that he and his associates had somehow suffered in a good cause that he had come to petersburg and fallen at the feet of porfiry grigoryevitch that he had been got by interest into a department but through the cruel persecution of fate he had been discharged from there too and that afterwards through reorganization the office itself had ceased to exist and that he had not been included in the new revised staff of clerks owing as much to direct incapacity for official work as to capacity for something else quite irrelevantall this mixed up with his passion for justice and of course the trickery of his enemies after finishing his story in the course of which mr zimoveykin more than once kissed his sullen and unshaven friend remnev he bowed down to all in the room in turn not forgetting avdotya the servant called them all his benefactors and explained that he was an undeserving troublesome mean insolent and stupid man and that good people must not be hard on his pitiful plight and simplicity after begging for their kind protection mr zimoveykin showed his livelier side grew very cheerful kissed ustinya fyodorovnas hands in spite of her modest protests that her hand was coarse and not like a ladys and towards evening promised to show the company his talent in a remarkable character dance but next day his visit ended in a lamentable dnouement either because there had been too much character in the characterdance or because he had in ustinya fyodorovnas own words somehow insulted her and treated her as no lady though she was on friendly terms with yaroslav ilyitch himself and if she liked might long ago have been an officers wife zimoveykin had to steer for home next day he went away came back again was again turned out with ignominy then wormed his way into semyon ivanovitchs good graces robbed him incidentally of his new breeches and now it appeared he had led semyon ivanovitch astray as soon as the landlady knew that semyon ivanovitch was alive and well and that there was no need to hunt for his passport she promptly left off grieving and was pacified meanwhile some of the lodgers determined to give the runaway a triumphal reception they broke the bolt and moved away the screen from mr prohartchins bed rumpled up the bed a little took the famous box put it at the foot of the bed and on the bed laid the sisterinlaw that is a dummy made up of an old kerchief a cap and a mantle of the landladys such an exact counterfeit of a sisterinlaw that it might have been mistaken for one having finished their work they waited for semyon ivanovitch to return meaning to tell him that his sisterinlaw had arrived from the country and was there behind his screen poor thing but they waited and waited already while they waited mark ivanovitch had staked and lost half a months salary to prepolovenko and kantarev already okeanovs nose had grown red and swollen playing flips on the nose and three cards already avdotya the servant had almost had her sleep out and had twice been on the point of getting up to fetch the wood and light the stove and zinovy prokofyevitch who kept running out every minute to see whether semyon ivanovitch were coming was wet to the skin but there was no sign of any one yetneither semyon ivanovitch nor the drunken cadger at last every one went to bed leaving the sisterinlaw behind the screen in readiness for any emergency and it was not till four oclock that a knock was heard at the gate but when it did come it was so loud that it quite made up to the expectant lodgers for all the wearisome trouble they had been through it was hehe himselfsemyon ivanovitch mr prohartchin but in such a condition that they all cried out in dismay and no one thought about the sisterinlaw the lost man was unconscious he was brought in or more correctly carried in by a sopping and tattered nightcabman to the landladys question where the poor dear man had got so groggy the cabman answered why he is not drunk and has not had a drop that i can tell you for sure but seemingly a faintness has come over him or some sort of a fit or maybe hes been knocked down by a blow they began examining him propping the culprit against the stove to do so more conveniently and saw that it really was not a case of drunkenness nor had he had a blow but that something else was wrong for semyon ivanovitch could not utter a word but seemed twitching in a sort of convulsion and only blinked fixing his eyes in bewilderment first on one and then on another of the spectators who were all attired in night array then they began questioning the cabman asking where he had got him from why from folks out kolomna way he answered deuce knows what they are not exactly gentry but merry rollicking gentlemen so he was like this when they gave him to me whether they had been fighting or whether he was in some sort of a fit goodness knows what it was but they were nice jolly gentlemen semyon ivanovitch was taken lifted high on the shoulders of two or three sturdy fellows and carried to his bed when semyon ivanovitch on being put in bed felt the sisterinlaw and put his feet on his sacred box he cried out at the top of his voice squatted up almost on his heels and trembling and shaking all over with his hands and his body he cleared a space as far as he could in his bed while gazing with a tremulous but strangely resolute look at those present he seemed as it were to protest that he would sooner die than give up the hundredth part of his poor belongings to any one semyon ivanovitch lay for two or three days closely barricaded by the screen and so cut off from all the world and all its vain anxieties next morning of course every one had forgotten about him time meanwhile flew by as usual hour followed hour and day followed day the sick mans heavy feverish brain was plunged in something between sleep and delirium but he lay quietly and did not moan or complain on the contrary he kept still and silent and controlled himself lying low in his bed just as the hare lies close to the earth when it hears the hunter at times a long depressing stillness prevailed in the flat a sign that the lodgers had all gone to the office and semyon ivanovitch waking up could relieve his depression by listening to the bustle in the kitchen where the landlady was busy close by or to the regular flop of avdotyas downtrodden slippers as sighing and moaning she cleared away rubbed and polished tidying all the rooms in the flat whole hours passed by in that way drowsy languid sleepy wearisome like the water that dripped with a regular sound from the locker into the basin in the kitchen at last the lodgers would arrive one by one or in groups and semyon ivanovitch could very conveniently hear them abusing the weather saying they were hungry making a noise smoking quarrelling and making friends playing cards and clattering the cups as they got ready for tea semyon ivanovitch mechanically made an effort to get up and join them as he had a right to do at tea but he at once sank back into drowsiness and dreamed that he had been sitting a long time at the teatable having tea with them and talking and that zinovy prokofyevitch had already seized the opportunity to introduce into the conversation some scheme concerning sistersinlaw and the moral relation of various worthy people to them at this point semyon ivanovitch was in haste to defend himself and reply but the mighty formula that flew from every tongueit has more than once been observedcut short all his objections and semyon ivanovitch could do nothing better than begin dreaming again that today was the first of the month and that he was receiving money in his office undoing the paper round it on the stairs he looked about him quickly and made haste as fast as he could to subtract half of the lawful wages he had received and conceal it in his boot then on the spot on the stairs quite regardless of the fact that he was in bed and asleep he made up his mind when he reached home to give his landlady what was due for board and lodging then to buy certain necessities and to show any one it might concern as it were casually and unintentionally that some of his salary had been deducted that now he had nothing left to send his sisterinlaw then to speak with commiseration of his sisterinlaw to say a great deal about her the next day and the day after and ten days later to say something casually again about her poverty that his companions might not forget making this determination he observed that andrey efimovitch that everlastingly silent bald little man who sat in the office three rooms from where semyon ivanovitch sat and hadnt said a word to him for twenty years was standing on the stairs that he too was counting his silver roubles and shaking his head he said to him money if theres no money there will be no porridge he added grimly as he went down the stairs and just at the door he ended and i have seven children sir then the little bald man probably equally unconscious that he was acting as a phantom and not as a substantial reality held up his hand about thirty inches from the floor and waving it vertically muttered that the eldest was going to school then glancing with indignation at semyon ivanovitch as though it were mr prohartchins fault that he was the father of seven pulled his old hat down over his eyes and with a whisk of his overcoat he turned to the left and disappeared semyon ivanovitch was quite frightened and though he was fully convinced of his own innocence in regard to the unpleasant accumulation of seven under one roof yet it seemed to appear that in fact no one else was to blame but semyon ivanovitch panicstricken he set off running for it seemed to him that the bald gentleman had turned back was running after him and meant to search him and take away all his salary insisting upon the indisputable number seven and resolutely denying any possible claim of any sort of sistersinlaw upon semyon ivanovitch prohartchin ran and ran gasping for breath beside him was running too an immense number of people and all of them were jingling their money in the tailpockets of their skimpy little dresscoats at last every one ran up there was the noise of fire engines and whole masses of people carried him almost on their shoulders up to that same house on fire which he had watched last time in company with the drunken cadger the drunken cadgeralias mr zimoveykinwas there now too he met semyon ivanovitch made a fearful fuss took him by the arm and led him into the thickest part of the crowd just as then in reality all about them was the noise and uproar of an immense crowd of people flooding the whole of fontanka embankment between the two bridges as well as all the surrounding streets and alleys just as then semyon ivanovitch in company with the drunken cadger was carried along behind a fence where they were squeezed as though in pincers in a huge timberyard full of spectators who had gathered from the street from tolkutchy market and from all the surrounding houses taverns and restaurants semyon ivanovitch saw all this and felt as he had done at the time in the whirl of fever and delirium all sorts of strange figures began flitting before him he remembered some of them one of them was a gentleman who had impressed every one extremely a man seven feet high with whiskers half a yard long who had been standing behind semyon ivanovitchs back during the fire and had given him encouragement from behind when our hero had felt something like ecstasy and had stamped as though intending thereby to applaud the gallant work of the firemen from which he had an excellent view from his elevated position another was the sturdy lad from whom our hero had received a shove by way of a lift on to another fence when he had been disposed to climb over it possibly to save some one he had a glimpse too of the figure of the old man with a sickly face in an old wadded dressinggown tied round the waist who had made his appearance before the fire in a little shop buying sugar and tobacco for his lodger and who now with a milkcan and a quart pot in his hands made his way through the crowd to the house in which his wife and daughter were burning together with thirteen and a half roubles in the corner under the bed but most distinct of all was the poor sinful woman of whom he had dreamed more than once during his illnessshe stood before him now as she had done then in wretched bark shoes and rags with a crutch and a wickerbasket on her back she was shouting more loudly than the firemen or the crowd waving her crutch and her arms saying that her own children had turned her out and that she had lost two coppers in consequence the children and the coppers the coppers and the children were mingled together in an utterly incomprehensible muddle from which every one withdrew baffled after vain efforts to understand but the woman would not desist she kept wailing shouting and waving her arms seeming to pay no attention either to the fire up to which she had been carried by the crowd from the street or to the people about her or to the misfortune of strangers or even to the sparks and redhot embers which were beginning to fall in showers on the crowd standing near at last mr prohartchin felt that a feeling of terror was coming upon him for he saw clearly that all this was not so to say an accident and that he would not get off scotfree and indeed upon the woodstack close to him was a peasant in a torn smock that hung loose about him with his hair and beard singed and he began stirring up all the people against semyon ivanovitch the crowd pressed closer and closer the peasant shouted and foaming at the mouth with horror mr prohartchin suddenly realized that this peasant was a cabman whom he had cheated five years before in the most inhuman way slipping away from him without paying through a side gate and jerking up his heels as he ran as though he were barefoot on hot bricks in despair mr prohartchin tried to speak to scream but his voice failed him he felt that the infuriated crowd was twining round him like a manycoloured snake strangling him crushing him he made an incredible effort and awoke then he saw that he was on fire that all his corner was on fire that his screen was on fire that the whole flat was on fire together with ustinya fyodorovna and all her lodgers that his bed was burning his pillow his quilt his box and last of all his precious mattress semyon ivanovitch jumped up clutched at the mattress and ran dragging it after him but in the landladys room into which regardless of decorum our hero ran just as he was barefoot and in his shirt he was seized held tight and triumphantly carried back behind the screen which meanwhile was not on fireit seemed that it was rather semyon ivanovitchs head that was on fireand was put back to bed it was just as some tattered unshaven illhumoured organgrinder puts away in his travelling box the punch who has been making an upset drubbing all the other puppets selling his soul to the devil and who at last ends his existence till the next performance in the same box with the devil the negroes the pierrot and mademoiselle katerina with her fortunate lover the captain immediately every one old and young surrounded semyon ivanovitch standing in a row round his bed and fastening eyes full of expectation on the invalid meantime he had come to himself but from shame or some other feeling began pulling up the quilt over him apparently wishing to hide himself under it from the attention of his sympathetic friends at last mark ivanovitch was the first to break silence and as a sensible man he began saying in a very friendly way that semyon ivanovitch must keep calm that it was too bad and a shame to be ill that only little children behaved like that that he must get well and go to the office mark ivanovitch ended by a little joke saying that no regular salary had yet been fixed for invalids and as he knew for a fact that their grade would be very low in the service to his thinking anyway their calling or condition did not promise great and substantial advantages in fact it was evident that they were all taking genuine interest in semyon ivanovitchs fate and were very sympathetic but with incomprehensible rudeness semyon ivanovitch persisted in lying in bed in silence and obstinately pulling the quilt higher and higher over his head mark ivanovitch however would not be gainsaid and restraining his feelings said something very honeyed to semyon ivanovitch again knowing that that was how he ought to treat a sick man but semyon ivanovitch would not feel this on the contrary he muttered something between his teeth with the most distrustful air and suddenly began glancing askance from right to left in a hostile way as though he would have reduced his sympathetic friends to ashes with his eyes it was no use letting it stop there mark ivanovitch lost patience and seeing that the man was offended and completely exasperated and had simply made up his mind to be obstinate told him straight out without any softening suavity that it was time to get up that it was no use lying there that shouting day and night about houses on fire sistersinlaw drunken cadgers locks boxes and goodness knows what was all stupid improper and degrading for if semyon ivanovitch did not want to sleep himself he should not hinder other people and please would he bear it in mind this speech produced its effects for semyon ivanovitch turning promptly to the orator articulated firmly though in a hoarse voice you hold your tongue puppy you idle speaker you foulmouthed man do you hear young dandy are you a prince eh do you understand what i say hearing such insults mark ivanovitch fired up but realizing that he had to deal with a sick man magnanimously overcame his resentment and tried to shame him out of his humour but was cut short in that too for semyon ivanovitch observed at once that he would not allow people to play with him for all that mark ivanovitch wrote poetry then followed a silence of two minutes at last recovering from his amazement mark ivanovitch plainly clearly in wellchosen language but with firmness declared that semyon ivanovitch ought to understand that he was among gentlemen and you ought to understand sir how to behave with gentlemen mark ivanovitch could on occasion speak effectively and liked to impress his hearers but probably from the habit of years of silence semyon ivanovitch talked and acted somewhat abruptly and moreover when he did on occasion begin a long sentence as he got further into it every word seemed to lead to another word that other word to a third word that third to a fourth and so on so that his mouth seemed brimming over he began stuttering and the crowding words took to flying out in picturesque disorder that was why semyon ivanovitch who was a sensible man sometimes talked terrible nonsense you are lying he said now you booby you loose fellow youll come to wantyoull go begging you seditious fellow youyou loafer take that you poet why you are still raving arent you semyon ivanovitch i tell you what answered semyon ivanovitch fools rave drunkards rave dogs rave but a wise man acts sensibly i tell you you dont know your own business you loafer you educated gentleman you learned book here youll get on fire and not notice your heads burning off what do you think of that why you mean how do you mean burn my head off semyon ivanovitch mark ivanovitch said no more for every one saw clearly that semyon ivanovitch was not yet in his sober senses but delirious but the landlady could not resist remarking at this point that the house in crooked lane had been burnt owing to a bald wench that there was a baldheaded wench living there that she had lighted a candle and set fire to the lumber room but nothing would happen in her place and everything would be all right in the flats but look here semyon ivanovitch cried zinovy prokofyevitch losing patience and interrupting the landlady you old fogey you old crock you silly felloware they making jokes with you now about your sisterinlaw or examinations in dancing is that it is that what you think now i tell you what answered our hero sitting up in bed and making a last effort in a paroxysm of fury with his sympathetic friends whos the fool you are the fool a dog is a fool you joking gentleman but i am not going to make jokes to please you sir do you hear puppy i am not your servant sir semyon ivanovitch would have said something more but he fell back in bed helpless his sympathetic friends were left gaping in perplexity for they understood now what was wrong with semyon ivanovitch and did not know how to begin suddenly the kitchen door creaked and opened and the drunken cadgeralias mr zimoveykintimidly thrust in his head cautiously sniffing round the place as his habit was it seemed as though he had been expected every one waved to him at once to come quickly and zimoveykin highly delighted with the utmost readiness and haste jostled his way to semyon ivanovitchs bedside it was evident that zimoveykin had spent the whole night in vigil and in great exertions of some sort the right side of his face was plastered up his swollen eyelids were wet from his running eyes his coat and all his clothes were torn while the whole left side of his attire was bespattered with something extremely nasty possibly mud from a puddle under his arm was somebodys violin which he had been taking somewhere to sell apparently they had not made a mistake in summoning him to their assistance for seeing the position of affairs he addressed the delinquent at once and with the air of a man who knows what he is about and feels that he has the upper hand said what are you thinking about get up senka what are you doing a clever chap like you be sensible or i shall pull you out of bed if you are obstreperous dont be obstreperous this brief but forcible speech surprised them all still more were they surprised when they noticed that semyon ivanovitch hearing all this and seeing this person before him was so flustered and reduced to such confusion and dismay that he could scarcely mutter through his teeth in a whisper the inevitable protest go away you wretch he said you are a wretched creatureyou are a thief do you hear do you understand you are a great swell my fine gentleman you regular swell no my boy zimoveykin answered emphatically retaining all his presence of mind youre wrong there you wise fellow you regular prohartchin zimoveykin went on parodying semyon ivanovitch and looking round gleefully dont be obstreperous behave yourself senka behave yourself or ill give you away ill tell them all about it my lad do you understand apparently semyon ivanovitch did understand for he started when he heard the conclusion of the speech and began looking rapidly about him with an utterly desperate air satisfied with the effect mr zimoveykin would have continued but mark ivanovitch checked his zeal and waiting till semyon ivanovitch was still and almost calm again began judiciously impressing on the uneasy invalid at great length that to harbour ideas such as he now had in his head was first useless and secondly not only useless but harmful and in fact not so much harmful as positively immoral and the cause of it all was that semyon ivanovitch was not only a bad example but led them all into temptation every one expected satisfactory results from this speech moreover by now semyon ivanovitch was quite quiet and replied in measured terms a quiet discussion followed they appealed to him in a friendly way inquiring what he was so frightened of semyon ivanovitch answered but his answers were irrelevant they answered him he answered them there were one or two more observations on both sides and then every one rushed into discussion for suddenly such a strange and amazing subject cropped up that they did not know how to express themselves the argument at last led to impatience impatience led to shouting and shouting even to tears and mark ivanovitch went away at last foaming at the mouth and declaring that he had never known such a blockhead oplevaniev spat in disgust okeanov was frightened zinovy prokofyevitch became tearful while ustinya fyodorovna positively howled wailing that her lodger was leaving them and had gone off his head that he would die poor dear man without a passport and without telling any one while she was a lone lorn woman and that she would be dragged from pillar to post in fact they all saw clearly at last that the seed they had sown had yielded a hundredfold that the soil had been too productive and that in their company semyon ivanovitch had succeeded in overstraining his wits completely and in the most irrevocable manner every one subsided into silence for though they saw that semyon ivanovitch was frightened the sympathetic friends were frightened too what cried mark ivanovitch but what are you afraid of what have you gone off your head about whos thinking about you my good sir have you the right to be afraid who are you what are you nothing sir a round nought sir that is what you are what are you making a fuss about a woman has been run over in the street so are you going to be run over some drunkard did not take care of his pocket but is that any reason why your coattails should be cut off a house is burnt down so your head is to be burnt off is it is that it sir is that it you you you stupid muttered semyon ivanovitch if your nose were cut off you would eat it up with a bit of bread and not notice it i may be a dandy shouted mark ivanovitch not listening i may be a regular dandy but i have not to pass an examination to get marriedto learn dancing the ground is firm under me sir why my good man havent you room enough is the floor giving way under your feet or what well they wont ask

head tell us plainly what have you done own up if you have done something wrong its no use being ashamed are you off your head my good man eh hes off his head hes gone off his head they all cried and wrung their hands in despair while the landlady threw both her arms round mark ivanovitch for fear he should tear semyon ivanovitch to pieces you heathen you heathenish soul you wise man zimoveykin besought him senka you are not a man to take offence you are a polite prepossessing man you are simple you are good do you hear it all comes from your goodness here i am a ruffian and a fool i am a beggar but good people havent abandoned me no fear you see they treat me with respect i thank them and the landlady here you see i bow down to the ground to them here see see i am paying what is due to you landlady at this point zimoveykin swung off with pedantic dignity a low bow right down to the ground after that semyon ivanovitch would have gone on talking but this time they would not let him they all intervened began entreating him assuring him comforting him and succeeded in making semyon ivanovitch thoroughly ashamed of himself and at last in a faint voice he asked leave to explain himself very well then he said i am prepossessing i am quiet i am good faithful and devoted to the last drop of my blood you know do you hear you puppy you swell granted the job is going on but you see i am poor and what if they take it do you hear you swell hold your tongue and try to understand theyll take it and thats all about it its going on brother and then not going on do you understand and i shall go begging my bread do you hear senka zimoveykin bawled frantically drowning the general hubbub with his voice you are seditious ill inform against you what are you saying who are you are you a rebel you sheeps head a rowdy stupid man they would turn off without a character but what are you well thats just it what well there it is how do you mean why i am free hes free and here one

only try to understand you sheep i am lawabiding i am lawabiding today i am lawabiding tomorrow and then all of a sudden they kick me out and call me seditious what are you saying mark ivanovitch thundered at last jumping up from the chair on which he had sat down to rest running up to the bed and in a frenzy shaking with vexation and fury what do you mean you sheep youve nothing to call your own why are you the only person in the world was the world made for you do you suppose are you a napoleon what are you who are you are you a napoleon eh tell me are you a napoleon but mr prohartchin did not answer this question not because he was overcome with shame at being a napoleon and was afraid of taking upon himself such a responsibilityno he was incapable of disputing further or saying anything his illness had reached a crisis tiny teardrops gushed suddenly from his glittering feverish grey eyes he hid his burning head in his bony hands that were wasted by illness sat up in bed and sobbing began to say that he was quite poor that he was a simple unlucky man that he was foolish and unlearned he begged kind folks to forgive him to take care of him to protect him to give him food and drink not to leave him in want and goodness knows what else semyon ivanovitch said as he uttered this appeal he looked about him in wild terror as though he were expecting the ceiling to fall or the floor to give way every one felt his heart soften and move to pity as he looked at the poor fellow the landlady sobbing and wailing like a peasant woman at her forlorn condition laid the invalid back in bed with her own hands mark ivanovitch seeing the uselessness of touching upon the memory of napoleon instantly relapsed into kindliness and came to her assistance the others in order to do something suggested raspberry tea saying that it always did good at once and that the invalid would like it very much but zimoveykin contradicted them all saying there was nothing better than a good dose of camomile or something of the sort as for zinovy prokofyevitch having a good heart he sobbed and shed tears in his remorse for having frightened semyon ivanovitch with all sorts of absurdities and gathering from the invalids last words that he was quite poor and needing assistance he proceeded to get up a subscription for him confining it for a time to the tenants of the flat every one was sighing and moaning every one felt sorry and grieved and yet all wondered how it was a man could be so completely panicstricken and what was he frightened about it would have been all very well if he had had a good post had had a wife a lot of children it would have been excusable if he were being hauled up before the court on some charge or other but he was a man utterly insignificant with nothing but a trunk and a german lock he had been lying more than twenty years behind his screen saying nothing knowing nothing of the world nor of trouble saving his halfpence and now at a frivolous idle word the man had actually gone off his head was utterly panicstricken at the thought he might have a hard time of it and it never occurred to him that every one has a hard time of it if he would only take that into consideration okeanov said afterwards that we all have a hard time then the man would have kept his head would have given up his antics and would have put up with things one way or another all day long nothing was talked of but semyon ivanovitch they went up to him inquired after him tried to comfort him but by the evening he was beyond that the poor fellow began to be delirious feverish he sank into unconsciousness so that they almost thought of sending for a doctor the lodgers all agreed together and undertook to watch over semyon ivanovitch and soothe him by turns through the night and if anything happened to wake all the rest immediately with the object of keeping awake they sat down to cards setting beside the invalid his friend the drunken cadger who had spent the whole day in the flat and had asked leave to stay the night as the game was played on credit and was not at all interesting they soon got bored they gave up the game then got into an argument about something then began to be loud and noisy finally dispersed to their various corners went on for a long time angrily shouting and wrangling and as all of them felt suddenly illhumoured they no longer cared to sit up so went to sleep soon it was as still in the flat as in an empty cellar and it was the more like one because it was horribly cold the last to fall asleep was okeanov and it was between sleeping and waking as he said afterwards i fancied just before morning two men kept talking close by me okeanov said that he recognized zimoveykin and that zimoveykin began waking his old friend remnev just beside him that they talked for a long time in a whisper then zimoveykin went away and could be heard trying to unlock the door into the kitchen the key the landlady declared afterwards was lying under her pillow and was lost that night finallyokeanov testifiedhe had fancied he had heard them go behind the screen to the invalid and light a candle there and i know nothing more he said i fell asleep and woke up as everybody else did when every one in the flat jumped out of bed at the sound behind the screen of a shriek that would have roused the dead and it seemed to many of them that a candle went out at that moment a great hubbub arose every ones heart stood still they rushed pellmell at the shriek but at that moment there was a scuffle with shouting swearing and fighting they struck a light and saw that zimoveykin and remnev were fighting together that they were swearing and abusing one another and as they turned the light on them one of them shouted its not me its this ruffian and the other who was zimoveykin was shouting dont touch me ive done nothing ill take my oath any minute both of them looked hardly like human beings but for the first minute they had no attention to spare for them the invalid was not where he had been behind the screen they immediately parted the combatants and dragged them away and saw that mr prohartchin was lying under the bed he must while completely unconscious have dragged the quilt and pillow after him so that there was nothing left on the bedstead but the bare mattress old and greasy he never had sheets they pulled semyon ivanovitch out stretched him on the mattress but soon realized that there was no need to make trouble over him that he was completely done for his arms were stiff and he seemed all to pieces they stood over him he still faintly shuddered and trembled all over made an effort to do something with his arms could not utter a word but blinked his eyes as they say heads do when still warm and bleeding after being just chopped off by the executioner at last the body grew more and more still the last faint convulsions died away mr prohartchin had set off with his good deeds and his sins whether semyon ivanovitch had been frightened by something whether he had had a dream as remnev maintained afterwards or there had been some other mischiefnobody knew all that can be said is that if the head clerk had made his appearance at that moment in the flat and had announced that semyon ivanovitch was dismissed for sedition insubordination and drunkenness if some old draggletailed beggar woman had come in at the door calling herself semyon ivanovitchs sisterinlaw or if semyon ivanovitch had just received two hundred roubles as a reward or if the house had caught fire and semyon ivanovitchs head had been really burninghe would in all probability not have deigned to stir a finger in any of these eventualities while the first stupefaction was passing over while all present were regaining their powers of speech were working themselves up into a fever of excitement shouting and flying to conjectures and suppositions while ustinya fyodorovna was pulling the box from under his bed was rummaging in a fluster under the mattress and even in semyon ivanovitchs boots while they crossquestioned remnev and zimoveykin okeanov who had hitherto been the quietest humblest and least original of the lodgers suddenly plucked up all his presence of mind and displayed all his latent talents by taking up his hat and under cover of the general uproar slipping out of the flat and just when the horrors of disorder and anarchy had reached their height in the agitated flat till then so tranquil the door opened and suddenly there descended upon them like snow upon their heads a personage of gentlemanly appearance with a severe and displeasedlooking face behind him yaroslav ilyitch behind yaroslav ilyitch his subordinates and the functionaries whose duty it is to be present on such occasions and behind them all much embarrassed mr okeanov the severelooking personage of gentlemanly appearance went straight up to semyon ivanovitch examined him made a wry face shrugged his shoulders and announced what everybody knew that is that the dead man was dead only adding that the same thing had happened a day or two ago to a gentleman of consequence highly respected who had died suddenly in his sleep then the personage of gentlemanly but displeasedlooking appearance walked away saying that they had troubled him for nothing and took himself off his place was at once filled while remnev and zimoveykin were handed over to the custody of the proper functionaries by yaroslav ilyitch who questioned some one adroitly took possession of the box which the landlady was already trying to open put the boots back in their proper place observing that they were all in holes and no use asked for the pillow to be put back called up okeanov asked for the key of the box which was found in the pocket of the drunken cadger and solemnly in the presence of the proper officials unlocked semyon ivanovitchs property everything was displayed two rags a pair of socks half a handkerchief an old hat several buttons some old soles and the uppers of a pair of boots that is all sorts of odds and ends scraps rubbish trash which had a stale smell the only thing of any value was the german lock they called up okeanov and crossquestioned him sternly but okeanov was ready to take his oath they asked for the pillow they examined it it was extremely dirty but in other respects it was like all other pillows they attacked the mattress they were about to lift it up but stopped for a moments consideration when suddenly and quite unexpectedly something heavy fell with a clink on the floor they bent down and saw on the floor a screw of paper and in the screw some dozen roubles ahey said yaroslav ilyitch pointing to a slit in the mattress from which hair and stuffing were sticking out they examined the slit and found that it had only just been made with a knife and was half a yard in length they thrust hands into the gap and pulled out a kitchen knife probably hurriedly thrust in there after slitting the mattress before yaroslav ilyitch had time to pull the knife out of the slit and to say ahey again another screw of money fell out and after it one at a time two half roubles a quarter rouble then some small change and an oldfashioned solid fivekopeck pieceall this was seized upon at this point it was realized that it would not be amiss to cut up the whole mattress with scissors they asked for scissors meanwhile the guttering candle lighted up a scene that would have been extremely curious to a spectator about a dozen lodgers were grouped round the bed in the most picturesque costumes all unbrushed unshaven unwashed sleepylooking just as they had gone to bed some were quite pale while others had drops of sweat upon their brows some were shuddering while others looked feverish the landlady utterly stupefied was standing quietly with her hands folded waiting for yaroslav ilyitchs good pleasure from the stove above the heads of avdotya the servant and the landladys favourite cat looked down with frightened curiosity the torn and broken screen lay cast on the floor the open box displayed its uninviting contents the quilt and pillow lay tossed at random covered with fluff from the mattress and on the threelegged wooden table gleamed the steadily growing heap of silver and other coins only semyon ivanovitch preserved his composure lying calmly on the bed and seeming to have no foreboding of his ruin when the scissors had been brought and yaroslav ilyitchs assistant wishing to be of service shook the mattress rather impatiently to ease it from under the back of its owner semyon ivanovitch with his habitual civility made room a little rolling on his side with his back to the searchers then at a second shake he turned on his face finally gave way still further and as the last slat in the bedstead was missing he suddenly and quite unexpectedly plunged head downward leaving in view only two bony thin blue legs which stuck upwards like two branches of a charred tree as this was the second time that morning that mr prohartchin had poked his head under his bed it at once aroused suspicion and some of the lodgers headed by zinovy prokofyevitch crept under it with the intention of seeing whether there were something hidden there too but they knocked their heads together for nothing and as yaroslav ilyitch shouted to them bidding them release semyon ivanovitch at once from his unpleasant position two of the more sensible seized each a leg dragged the unsuspected capitalist into the light of day and laid him across the bed meanwhile the hair and flock were flying about the heap of silver grewand my goodness what a lot there was noble silver roubles stout solid rouble and a half pieces pretty half rouble coins plebeian quarter roubles twenty kopeck pieces even the unpromising old crones small fry of ten and five kopeck silver piecesall done up in separate bits of paper in the most methodical and systematic way there were curiosities also two counters of some sort one napolon dor one very rare coin of some unknown kind some of the roubles were of the greatest antiquity they were rubbed and hacked coins of elizabeth german kreutzers coins of peter of catherine there were for instance old fifteenkopeck pieces now very rare pierced for wearing as earrings all much worn yet with the requisite number of dots there was even copper but all of that was green and tarnished they found one red note but no more at last when the dissection was quite over and the mattress case had been shaken more than once without a clink they piled all the money on the table and set to work to count it at the first glance one might well have been deceived and have estimated it at a million it was such an immense heap but it was not a million though it did turn out to be a very considerable sumexactly roubles and a halfso that if zinovy prokofyevitchs subscription had been raised the day before there would perhaps have been just roubles they took the money they put a seal on the dead mans box they listened to the landladys complaints and informed her when and where she ought to lodge information in regard to the dead mans little debt to her a receipt was taken from the proper person at that point hints were dropped in regard to the sisterinlaw but being persuaded that in a certain sense the sisterinlaw was a myth that is a product of the defective imagination with which they had more than once reproached semyon ivanovitchthey abandoned the idea as useless mischievous and disadvantageous to the good name of mr prohartchin and so the matter ended when the first shock was over when the lodgers had recovered themselves and realized the sort of person their late companion had been they all subsided relapsed into silence and began looking distrustfully at one another some seemed to take semyon ivanovitchs behaviour very much to heart and even to feel affronted by it what a fortune so the man had saved up like this not losing his composure mark ivanovitch proceeded to explain why semyon ivanovitch had been so suddenly panicstricken but they did not listen to him zinovy prokofyevitch was very thoughtful okeanov had had a little to drink the others seemed rather crestfallen while a little man called kantarev with a nose like a sparrows beak left the flat that evening after very carefully packing up and cording all his boxes and bags and coldly explaining to the curious that times were hard and that the terms here were beyond his means the landlady wailed without ceasing lamenting for semyon ivanovitch and cursing him for having taken advantage of her lone lorn state mark ivanovitch was asked why the dead man had not taken his money to the bank he was too simple my good soul he hadnt enough imagination answered mark ivanovitch yes and you have been too simple too my good woman okeanov put in for twenty years the man kept himself close here in your flat and here hes been knocked down by a featherwhile you went on cooking cabbagesoup and had no time to notice it ahah my good woman oh the poor dear the landlady went on what need of a bank if hed brought me his pile and said to me take it ustinyushka poor dear here is all i have keep and board me in my helplessness so long as i am on earth then by the holy ikon i would have fed him i would have given him drink i would have looked after him ah the sinner ah the deceiver he deceived me he cheated me a poor lone woman they went up to the bed again semyon ivanovitch was lying properly now dressed in his best though indeed it was his only suit hiding his rigid chin behind a cravat which was tied rather awkwardly washed brushed but not quite shaven because there was no razor in the flat the only one which had belonged to zinovy prokofyevitch had lost its edge a year ago and had been very profitably sold at tolkutchy market the others used to go to the barbers they had not yet had time to clear up the disorder the broken screen lay as before and exposing semyon ivanovitchs seclusion seemed like an emblem of the fact that death tears away the veil from all our secrets our shifty dodges and intrigues the stuffing from the mattress lay about in heaps the whole room suddenly so still might well have been compared by a poet to the ruined nest of a swallow broken down and torn to pieces by the storm the nestlings and their mother killed and their warm little bed of fluff feather and flock scattered about them semyon ivanovitch however looked more like a conceited thievish old cocksparrow he kept quite quiet now seemed to be lying low as though he were not guilty as though he had had nothing to do with the shameless conscienceless and unseemly duping and deception of all these good people he did not heed now the sobs and wailing of his bereaved and wounded landlady on the contrary like a wary callous capitalist anxious not to waste a minute in idleness even in the coffin he seemed to be wrapped up in some speculative calculation there was a look of deep reflection in his face while his lips were drawn together with a significant air of which semyon ivanovitch during his lifetime had not been suspected of being capable he seemed as it were to have grown shrewder his right eye was as it were slyly screwed up semyon ivanovitch seemed wanting to say something to make some very important communication and explanation and without loss of time because things were complicated and there was not a minute to lose and it seemed as though they could hear him what is it give over do you hear you stupid woman dont whine go to bed and sleep it off my good woman do you hear i am dead theres no need of a fuss now whats the use of it really its nice to lie here though i dont mean that do you hear you are a fine lady you are a regular fine lady understand that here i am dead now but look here what ifthat is perhaps it cant be sobut i say what if im not dead what if i get up do you
