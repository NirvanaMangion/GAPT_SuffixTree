preface 


the present work is a modest effort to reproduce approximately  in modern
measures  the venerable epic  beowulf   approximately   i repeat  for a
very close reproduction of anglo saxon verse would  to a large extent  be
prose to a modern ear 

the heyne socin text and glossary have been closely followed  occasionally
a deviation has been made  but always for what seemed good and sufficient
reason  the translator does not aim to be an editor  once in a while 
however  he has added a conjecture of his own to the emendations quoted
from the criticisms of other students of the poem 

this work is addressed to two classes of readers  from both of these alike
the translator begs sympathy and co operation  the anglo saxon scholar he
hopes to please by adhering faithfully to the original  the student of
english literature he aims to interest by giving him  in modern garb  the
most ancient epic of our race  this is a bold and venturesome undertaking 
and yet there must be some students of the teutonic past willing to follow
even a daring guide  if they may read in modern phrases of the sorrows of
hrothgar  of the prowess of beowulf  and of the feelings that stirred the
hearts of our forefathers in their primeval homes 

in order to please the larger class of readers  a regular cadence has been
used  a measure which  while retaining the essential characteristics of
the original  permits the reader to see ahead of him in reading 

perhaps every anglo saxon scholar has his own theory as to how beowulf
should be translated  some have given us prose versions of what we believe
to be a great poem  is it any reflection on our honored kemble and arnold
to say that their translations fail to show a layman that beowulf is
justly called our first  epic   of those translators who have used verse 
several have written from what would seem a mistaken point of view  is it
proper  for instance  that the grave and solemn speeches of beowulf and
hrothgar be put in ballad measures  tripping lightly and airily along  or 
again  is it fitting that the rough martial music of anglo saxon verse be
interpreted to us in the smooth measures of modern blank verse  do we hear
what has been beautifully called  the clanging tread of a warrior in
mail  

 viii 

of all english translations of beowulf  that of professor garnett alone
gives any adequate idea of the chief characteristics of this great
teutonic epic 

the measure used in the present translation is believed to be as near a
reproduction of the original as modern english affords  the cadences
closely resemble those used by browning in some of his most striking
poems  the four stresses of the anglo saxon verse are retained  and as
much thesis and anacrusis is allowed as is consistent with a regular
cadence  alliteration has been used to a large extent  but it was thought
that modern ears would hardly tolerate it on every line  end rhyme has
been used occasionally  internal rhyme  sporadically  both have some
warrant in anglo saxon poetry   for end rhyme  see             for
internal rhyme              

what gummere    calls the  rime giver  has been studiously kept   viz   
the first accented syllable in the second half verse always carries the
alliteration  and the last accented syllable alliterates only
sporadically  alternate alliteration is occasionally used as in the
original   see            

no two accented syllables have been brought together  except occasionally
after a c sural pause   see      and        or  scientifically speaking 
sievers s c type has been avoided as not consonant with the plan of
translation  several of his types  however  constantly occur   e g   a and
a variant    x     x     x x     x   b and a variant  x     x      x x    
x      a variant of d    x     x x   e    x x        anacrusis gives
further variety to the types used in the translation 

the parallelisms of the original have been faithfully preserved    e g   
     and        lord  and  wielder of glory                          and
           and           and       occasionally  some loss has been
sustained  but  on the other hand  a gain has here and there been made 

the effort has been made to give a decided flavor of archaism to the
translation  all words not in keeping with the spirit of the poem have
been avoided  again  though many archaic words have been used  there are
none  it is believed  which are not found in standard modern poetry 

 ix 

with these preliminary remarks  it will not be amiss to give an outline of
the story of the poem 


 the story  

 hrothgar  king of the danes  or scyldings  builds a great mead hall  or
palace  in which he hopes to feast his liegemen and to give them presents 
the joy of king and retainers is  however  of short duration  grendel  the
monster  is seized with hateful jealousy  he cannot brook the sounds of
joyance that reach him down in his fen dwelling near the hall  oft and
anon he goes to the joyous building  bent on direful mischief  thane after
thane is ruthlessly carried off and devoured  while no one is found strong
enough and bold enough to cope with the monster  for twelve years he
persecutes hrothgar and his vassals  

 over sea  a day s voyage off  beowulf  of the geats  nephew of higelac 
king of the geats  hears of grendel s doings and of hrothgar s misery  he
resolves to crush the fell monster and relieve the aged king  with
fourteen chosen companions  he sets sail for dane land  reaching that
country  he soon persuades hrothgar of his ability to help him  the hours
that elapse before night are spent in beer drinking and conversation  when
hrothgar s bedtime comes he leaves the hall in charge of beowulf  telling
him that never before has he given to another the absolute wardship of his
palace  all retire to rest  beowulf  as it were  sleeping upon his arms  

 grendel comes  the great march stepper  bearing god s anger  he seizes
and kills one of the sleeping warriors  then he advances towards beowulf 
a fierce and desperate hand to hand struggle ensues  no arms are used 
both combatants trusting to strength and hand grip  beowulf tears
grendel s shoulder from its socket  and the monster retreats to his den 
howling and yelling with agony and fury  the wound is fatal  

 the next morning  at early dawn  warriors in numbers flock to the hall
heorot  to hear the news  joy is boundless  glee runs high  hrothgar and
his retainers are lavish of gratitude and of gifts  

 grendel s mother  however  comes the next night to avenge his death  she
is furious and raging  while beowulf is sleeping in a room somewhat apart
 x  from the quarters of the other warriors  she seizes one of hrothgar s
favorite counsellors  and carries him off and devours him  beowulf is
called  determined to leave heorot entirely purified  he arms himself  and
goes down to look for the female monster  after traveling through the
waters many hours  he meets her near the sea bottom  she drags him to her
den  there he sees grendel lying dead  after a desperate and almost fatal
struggle with the woman  he slays her  and swims upward in triumph  taking
with him grendel s head  

 joy is renewed at heorot  congratulations crowd upon the victor  hrothgar
literally pours treasures into the lap of beowulf  and it is agreed among
the vassals of the king that beowulf will be their next liegelord  

 beowulf leaves dane land  hrothgar weeps and laments at his departure  

 when the hero arrives in his own land  higelac treats him as a
distinguished guest  he is the hero of the hour  

 beowulf subsequently becomes king of his own people  the geats  after he
has been ruling for fifty years  his own neighborhood is wofully harried
by a fire spewing dragon  beowulf determines to kill him  in the ensuing
struggle both beowulf and the dragon are slain  the grief of the geats is
inexpressible  they determine  however  to leave nothing undone to honor
the memory of their lord  a great funeral pyre is built  and his body is
burnt  then a memorial barrow is made  visible from a great distance  that
sailors afar may be constantly reminded of the prowess of the national
hero of geatland  

 the poem closes with a glowing tribute to his bravery  his gentleness 
his goodness of heart  and his generosity  

                                        

it is the devout desire of this translator to hasten the day when the
story of beowulf shall be as familiar to english speaking peoples as that
of the iliad  beowulf is our first great epic  it is an epitomized history
of the life of the teutonic races  it brings vividly before us our
forefathers of pre alfredian eras  in their love of war  of sea  and of
adventure 

my special thanks are due to professors francis a  march and james a 
harrison  for advice  sympathy  and assistance

hrothgar and beowulf 


 hrothgar remembers beowulf as a youth  and also remembers his father  

          hrothgar answered  helm of the scyldings 
           i remember this man as the merest of striplings 
          his father long dead now was ecgtheow titled 
          him hrethel the geatman granted at home his
          one only daughter  his battle brave son
          is come but now  sought a trustworthy friend 
          seafaring sailors asserted it then 

 beowulf is reported to have the strength of thirty men  

          who valuable gift gems of the geatmen    carried
          as peace offering thither  that he thirty men s grapple
          has in his hand  the hero in battle 

 god hath sent him to our rescue  

          the holy creator usward sent him 
          to west dane warriors  i ween  for to render
           gainst grendel s grimness gracious assistance 
          i shall give to the good one gift gems for courage 
          hasten to bid them hither to speed them    
          to see assembled this circle of kinsmen 
          tell them expressly they re welcome in sooth to
          the men of the danes   to the door of the building

    

 wulfgar invites the strangers in  

          wulfgar went then  this word message shouted 
           my victorious liegelord bade me to tell you 
          the east danes  atheling  that your origin knows he 
          and o er wave billows wafted ye welcome are hither 
          valiant of spirit  ye straightway may enter
          clad in corslets  cased in your helmets 
          to see king hrothgar  here let your battle boards 
          wood spears and war shafts  await your conferring  
          the mighty one rose then  with many a liegeman 
          an excellent thane group  some there did await them 
          and as bid of the brave one the battle gear guarded 
          together they hied them  while the hero did guide them 
           neath heorot s roof  the high minded went then
          sturdy  neath helmet till he stood in the building 
          beowulf spake  his burnie did glisten 
          his armor seamed over by the art of the craftsman  

 beowulf salutes hrothgar  and then proceeds to boast of his youthful
achievements  

           hail thou  hrothgar  i am higelac s kinsman
          and vassal forsooth  many a wonder
          i dared as a stripling  the doings of grendel

          excellent edifice  empty and useless
          to all the earlmen after evenlight s glimmer
           neath heaven s bright hues hath hidden its glory 
          this my earls then urged me  the most excellent of them 
          carles very clever  to come and assist thee 
          folk leader hrothgar  fully they knew of

 his fight with the nickers  

          the strength of my body  themselves they beheld me
          when i came from the contest  when covered with gore
          foes i escaped from  where five    i had bound 
          the giant race wasted  in the waters destroying
          the nickers by night  bore numberless sorrows 
          the weders avenged  woes had they suffered 
          enemies ravaged  alone now with grendel

 he intends to fight grendel unaided  

          i shall manage the matter  with the monster of evil 
          the giant  decide it  thee i would therefore
          beg of thy bounty  bright danish chieftain 
          lord of the scyldings  this single petition 
          not to refuse me  defender of warriors 
          friend lord of folks  so far have i sought thee 
          that  i  may unaided  my earlmen assisting me 
          this brave mooded war band  purify heorot 
          i have heard on inquiry  the horrible creature

 since the monster uses no weapons  

          from veriest rashness recks not for weapons 
          i this do scorn then  so be higelac gracious 
          my liegelord belov d  lenient of spirit

          the foe i must grapple  fight for my life then 
          foeman with foeman  he fain must rely on
          the doom of the lord whom death layeth hold of 

 should he crush me  he will eat my companions as he has eaten thy
thanes  

          i ween he will wish  if he win in the struggle 
          to eat in the war hall earls of the geat folk 
          boldly to swallow    them  as of yore he did often
          the best of the hrethmen  thou needest not trouble
          a head watch to give me     he will have me dripping

    

 in case of my defeat  thou wilt not have the trouble of burying me  

          and dreary with gore  if death overtake me

          the hermit will eat me  heedless of pity

  twas mere folly that actuated you both to risk your lives on the ocean  

          from vainest vaunting adventured your bodies
          in care of the waters  and no one was able
          nor lief nor loth one  in the least to dissuade you
          your difficult voyage  then ye ventured a swimming 
          where your arms outstretching the streams ye did cover 
          the mere ways measured  mixing and stirring them 
          glided the ocean  angry the waves were 
          with the weltering of winter  in the water s possession 
          ye toiled for a seven night  he at swimming outdid thee 
          in strength excelled thee  then early at morning
          on the heathoremes  shore the holm currents tossed him 
          sought he thenceward the home of his fathers 
          beloved of his liegemen  the land of the brondings 
          the peace castle pleasant  where a people he wielded 
          had borough and jewels  the pledge that he made thee

 a horrible sea beast attacked me  but i slew him

 the old king trusts beowulf  the heroes are joyful  

          heard from beowulf his bold resolution

          to the lord of the kingdom  first of the east danes

          of banquet and beaker  battle famed ruler 
          the helmingish lady then graciously circled

 she gives presents to the heroes  

          treasure cups tendered  till time was afforded
          that the decorous mooded  diademed folk queen

 then she offers the cup to beowulf  thanking god that aid has come  

          might bear to beowulf the bumper o errunning 
          she greeted the geat prince  god she did thank 
          most wise in her words  that her wish was accomplished 
          that in any of earlmen she ever should look for
          solace in sorrow  he accepted the beaker 
          battle bold warrior  at wealhtheow s giving 

 beowulf states to the queen the object of his visit  

          then equipped for combat quoth he in measures 
          beowulf spake  offspring of ecgtheow 
           i purposed in spirit when i mounted the ocean 

 i determined to do or die  

          when i boarded my boat with a band of my liegemen 
          i would work to the fullest the will of your people
          or in foe s clutches fastened fall in the battle 
          deeds i shall do of daring and prowess 
          or the last of my life days live in this mead hall  
          these words to the lady were welcome and pleasing 
          the boast of the geatman  with gold trappings broidered
          went the freeborn folk queen her fond lord to sit by 

 glee is high  

          then again as of yore was heard in the building
          courtly discussion  conquerors  shouting 
          heroes were happy  till healfdene s son would
          go to his slumber to seek for refreshing 
          for the horrid hell monster in the hall building knew he
          a fight was determined     since the light of the sun they
          no longer could see  and lowering darkness
          o er all had descended  and dark under heaven
          shadowy shapes came shying around them 

 hrothgar retires  leaving beowulf in charge of the hall  

          the liegemen all rose then  one saluted the other 
          hrothgar beowulf  in rhythmical measures 
          wishing him well  and  the wassail hall giving

 hrothgar retires  

          then hrothgar departed  his earl throng attending him 
          folk lord of scyldings  forth from the building 
          the war chieftain wished then wealhtheow to look for 
          the queen for a bedmate  to keep away grendel

 god has provided a watch for the hall  

          the glory of kings had given a hall watch 
          as men heard recounted  for the king of the danemen
          he did special service  gave the giant a watcher 
          and the prince of the geatmen implicitly trusted

 beowulf is self confident 

          his warlike strength and the wielder s protection 

 he prepares for rest  

          his armor of iron off him he did then 
          his helmet from his head  to his henchman committed
          his chased handled chain sword  choicest of weapons 
          and bade him bide with his battle equipments 
          the good one then uttered words of defiance 
          beowulf geatman  ere his bed he upmounted 

 beowulf boasts of his ability to cope with grendel  

           i hold me no meaner in matters of prowess 
          in warlike achievements  than grendel does himself 
          hence i seek not with sword edge to sooth him to slumber 
          of life to bereave him  though well i am able 

 we will fight with nature s weapons only  

          no battle skill    has he  that blows he should strike me 
          to shatter my shield  though sure he is mighty
          in strife and destruction  but struggling by night we
          shall do without edges  dare he to look for
          weaponless warfare  and wise mooded father

 god may decide who shall conquer 

          on which hand soever to him seemeth proper  
          then the brave mooded hero bent to his slumber 
          the pillow received the cheek of the noble 

 the geatish warriors lie down  

          and many a martial mere thane attending
          sank to his slumber  seemed it unlikely

 they thought it very unlikely that they should ever see their homes
again  

          that ever thereafter any should hope to
          be happy at home  hero friends visit
          or the lordly troop castle where he lived from his childhood 
          they had heard how slaughter had snatched from the wine hall 
          had recently ravished  of the race of the scyldings

 but god raised up a deliverer  

          too many by far  but the lord to them granted
          the weaving of war speed  to wederish heroes
          aid and comfort  that every opponent
          by one man s war might they worsted and vanquished 

 god rules the world  

          by the might of himself  the truth is established
          that god almighty hath governed for ages
          kindreds and nations  a night very lurid

 grendel comes to heorot  

          the trav ler at twilight came tramping and striding

 only one warrior is awake

          he angrily bided the issue of battle

    rendering h  so  rejects  the latter takes the passage as meaning that
    grendel  though mighty and formidable  has no skill in the art of war

    the division usually made at this point               usually rendered

    this acute scholar  i must say that it seems to me that the poet is
    exhausting his resources to bring out clearly the supreme event on

grendel and beowulf 


 grendel comes from the fens  

           neath the cloudy cliffs came from the moor then
          grendel going  god s anger bare he 
          the monster intended some one of earthmen
          in the hall building grand to entrap and make way with 

 he goes towards the joyous building  

          he went under welkin where well he knew of
          the wine joyous building  brilliant with plating 
          gold hall of earthmen  not the earliest occasion

 this was not his first visit there  

          he the home and manor of hrothgar had sought 
          ne er found he in life days later nor earlier
          hardier hero  hall thanes    more sturdy 
          then came to the building the warrior marching 

 his horrid fingers tear the door open  

          bereft of his joyance  the door quickly opened
          on fire hinges fastened  when his fingers had touched it 
          the fell one had flung then  his fury so bitter  
          open the entrance  early thereafter
          the foeman trod the shining hall pavement 

 he strides furiously into the hall  

          strode he angrily  from the eyes of him glimmered
          a lustre unlovely likest to fire 
          he beheld in the hall the heroes in numbers 
          a circle of kinsmen sleeping together 

 he exults over his supposed prey  

          a throng of thanemen  then his thoughts were exultant 
          he minded to sunder from each of the thanemen
          the life from his body  horrible demon 
          ere morning came  since fate had allowed him

 fate has decreed that he shall devour no more heroes  beowulf suffers
from suspense  

          the prospect of plenty  providence willed not
          to permit him any more of men under heaven
          to eat in the night time  higelac s kinsman
          great sorrow endured how the dire mooded creature
          in unlooked for assaults were likely to bear him 
          no thought had the monster of deferring the matter 

 grendel immediately seizes a sleeping warrior  and devours him  

          but on earliest occasion he quickly laid hold of
          a soldier asleep  suddenly tore him 
          bit his bone prison  the blood drank in currents 
          swallowed in mouthfuls  he soon had the dead man s
          feet and hands  too  eaten entirely 
          nearer he strode then  the stout hearted warrior

 beowulf and grendel grapple  

          snatched as he slumbered  seizing with hand grip 
          forward the foeman foined with his hand 
          caught he quickly the cunning deviser 
          on his elbow he rested  this early discovered
          the master of malice  that in middle earth s regions 
           neath the whole of the heavens  no hand grapple greater

 the monster is amazed at beowulf s strength  

          in any man else had he ever encountered 
          fearful in spirit  faint mooded waxed he 
          not off could betake him  death he was pondering 

 he is anxious to flee  

          would fly to his covert  seek the devils  assembly

          long in his lifetime  the liege kinsman worthy

 beowulf recalls his boast of the evening  and determines to fulfil it  

          of higelac minded his speech of the evening 
          stood he up straight and stoutly did seize him 
          his fingers crackled  the giant was outward 
          the earl stepped farther  the famous one minded
          to flee away farther  if he found an occasion 
          and off and away  avoiding delay 
          to fly to the fen moors  he fully was ware of
          the strength of his grapple in the grip of the foeman 

  twas a luckless day for grendel  

           twas an ill taken journey that the injury bringing 
          harrying harmer to heorot wandered

          the bold in battle  bent not to earthward 
          excellent earth hall  but within and without it
          was fastened so firmly in fetters of iron

 grendel s cries terrify the danes  

          novel enough  on the north danes fastened
          a terror of anguish  on all of the men there
          who heard from the wall the weeping and plaining 
          the song of defeat from the foeman of heaven 
          heard him hymns of horror howl  and his sorrow

grendel is vanquished 


 beowulf has no idea of letting grendel live  

          for no cause whatever would the earlmen s defender
          leave in life joys the loathsome newcomer 
          he deemed his existence utterly useless
          to men under heaven  many a noble
          of beowulf brandished his battle sword old 
          would guard the life of his lord and protector 
          the far famous chieftain  if able to do so 
          while waging the warfare  this wist they but little 
          brave battle thanes  while his body intending

 no weapon would harm grendel  he bore a charmed life  

          to slit into slivers  and seeking his spirit 
          that the relentless foeman nor finest of weapons
          of all on the earth  nor any of war bills
          was willing to injure  but weapons of victory
          swords and suchlike he had sworn to dispense with 
          his death at that time must prove to be wretched 
          and the far away spirit widely should journey
          into enemies  power  this plainly he saw then
          who with mirth    of mood malice no little
          had wrought in the past on the race of the earthmen
           to god he was hostile   that his body would fail him 
          but higelac s hardy henchman and kinsman
          held him by the hand  hateful to other

 grendel is sorely wounded  

          was each one if living  a body wound suffered
          the direful demon  damage incurable

 his body bursts  

          was seen on his shoulder  his sinews were shivered 
          his body did burst  to beowulf was given
          glory in battle  grendel from thenceward
          must flee and hide him in the fen cliffs and marshes 
          sick unto death  his dwelling must look for
          unwinsome and woful  he wist the more fully

 the monster flees away to hide in the moors  

          the end of his earthly existence was nearing 
          his life days  limits  at last for the danemen 
          when the slaughter was over  their wish was accomplished 
          the comer from far land had cleansed then of evil 
          wise and valiant  the war hall of hrothgar 
          saved it from violence  he joyed in the night work 
          in repute for prowess  the prince of the geatmen
          for the east danish people his boast had accomplished 
          bettered their burdensome bale sorrows fully 
          the craft begot evil they erstwhile had suffered
          and were forced to endure from crushing oppression 
          their manifold misery   twas a manifest token 

 beowulf suspends grendel s hand and arm in heorot  

          when the hero in battle the hand suspended 
          the arm and the shoulder  there was all of the claw
          of grendel together   neath great stretching hall roof 

        it has been proposed to translate  myr e  by  with sorrow   but
    there seems no authority for such a rendering  to the present

rejoicing of the danes 


 at early dawn  warriors from far and near come together to hear of the
night s adventures  

          in the mist of the morning many a warrior
          stood round the gift hall  as the story is told me 
          folk princes fared then from far and from near
          through long stretching journeys to look at the wonder 
          the footprints of the foeman  few of the warriors

 few warriors lamented grendel s destruction  

          who gazed on the foot tracks of the inglorious creature
          his parting from life pained very deeply 
          how  weary in spirit  off from those regions
          in combats conquered he carried his traces 
          fated and flying  to the flood of the nickers 

 grendel s blood dyes the waters  

          there in bloody billows bubbled the currents 
          the angry eddy was everywhere mingled
          and seething with gore  welling with sword blood    
          he death doomed had hid him  when reaved of his joyance
          he laid down his life in the lair he had fled to 
          his heathenish spirit  where hell did receive him 
          thence the friends from of old backward turned them 
          and many a younker from merry adventure 
          striding their stallions  stout from the seaward 
          heroes on horses  there were heard very often

 beowulf is the hero of the hour

 but no word is uttered to derogate from the old king

          to harm the great hero  and the hating one s grasp might

          its blade was of iron  blotted with poison

          only  twas larger than any man else was
          able to bear to the battle encounter 
          the good and splendid work of the giants 
          he grasped then the sword hilt  knight of the scyldings 
          bold and battle grim  brandished his ring sword 
          hopeless of living  hotly he smote her 
          that the fiend woman s neck firmly it grappled 

 and fells the female monster  

          broke through her bone joints  the bill fully pierced her
          fate curs d body  she fell to the ground then 
          the hand sword was bloody  the hero exulted 
          the brand was brilliant  brightly it glimmered 
          just as from heaven gemlike shineth
          the torch of the firmament  he glanced  long the building 
          and turned by the wall then  higelac s vassal
          raging and wrathful raised his battle sword
          strong by the handle  the edge was not useless
          to the hero in battle  but he speedily wished to
          give grendel requital for the many assaults he
          had worked on the west danes not once  but often 
          when he slew in slumber the subjects of hrothgar 
          swallowed down fifteen sleeping retainers
          of the folk of the danemen  and fully as many
          carried away  a horrible prey

 beowulf sees the body of grendel  and cuts off his head  

          when he saw on his rest place weary of conflict
          grendel lying  of life joys bereav d 
          as the battle at heorot erstwhile had scathed him 
          his body far bounded  a blow when he suffered 
          death having seized him  sword smiting heavy 
          and he cut off his head then  early this noticed
          the clever carles who as comrades of hrothgar

 the waters are gory  

          gazed on the sea deeps  that the surging wave currents

          the bold mooded scyldings  the gold friend of heroes
          homeward betook him  the strangers sat down then

          to see any more  the sword blade began then 
          the blood having touched it  contracting and shriveling
          with battle icicles   twas a wonderful marvel
          that it melted entirely  likest to ice when

          to god they were grateful  were glad in their chieftain 
          that to see him safe and sound was granted them 
          from the high minded hero  then  helmet and burnie
          were speedily loosened  the ocean was putrid 
          the water  neath welkin weltered with gore

    paper published some years ago in one of the johns hopkins university

    light derived from a study of like passages in alfred s prose   the
    impersonal verb  geweor an   with an accus  of the person  and a

     sweet s ed                                          in the two
    beowulf passages  the   t clause is anticipated by    s   which is
    clearly a gen  of the thing agreed on 

    the first passage  v        b        i translate literally   then many
    agreed upon this  namely   that the sea wolf had killed him  

    the second passage  v        b          she is promised      to this
    the friend of the scyldings has agreed  etc   by emending  is  instead
    of  w s          the tenses will be brought into perfect harmony 

    in v       ff  this same idiom occurs  and was noticed in b  s great

 god was fighting with me  

          gave me willingly to see on the wall a
          heavy old hand sword hanging in splendor
           he guided most often the lorn and the friendless  
          that i swung as a weapon  the wards of the house then
          i killed in the conflict  when occasion was given me  
          then the battle sword burned  the brand that was lifted

           it well may discomfit the prince of the heathobards
          and each of the thanemen of earls that attend him

          while they wielded their arms  till they misled to the battle
          their own dear lives and belov d companions 
          he saith at the banquet who the collar beholdeth 
          an ancient ash warrior who earlmen s destruction
          clearly recalleth  cruel his spirit  
          sadly beginneth sounding the youthful
          thane champion s spirit through the thoughts of his bosom 
          war grief to waken  and this word answer speaketh 

 ingeld is stirred up to break the truce  

           art thou able  my friend  to know when thou seest it
          the brand which thy father bare to the conflict
          in his latest adventure   neath visor of helmet 
          the dearly loved iron  where danemen did slay him 
          and brave mooded scyldings  on the fall of the heroes 
           when vengeance was sleeping  the slaughter place wielded 
          e en now some man of the murderer s progeny
          exulting in ornaments enters the building 
          boasts of his blood shedding  offbeareth the jewel
          which thou shouldst wholly hold in possession  
          so he urgeth and mindeth on every occasion
          with woe bringing words  till waxeth the season
          when the woman s thane for the works of his father 
          the bill having bitten  blood gory sleepeth 
          fated to perish  the other one thenceward
           scapeth alive  the land knoweth thoroughly    
          then the oaths of the earlmen on each side are broken 
          when rancors unresting are raging in ingeld
          and his wife love waxeth less warm after sorrow 
          so the heathobards  favor not faithful i reckon

          to the vassal distinguished  a tooth weaponed murderer 
          the well beloved henchman s body all swallowed 
          not the earlier off empty of hand did
          the bloody toothed murderer  mindful of evils 
          wish to escape from the gold giver s palace 
          but sturdy of strength he strove to outdo me 
          hand ready grappled  a glove was suspended
          spacious and wondrous  in art fetters fastened 
          which was fashioned entirely by touch of the craftman
          from the dragon s skin by the devil s devices 
          he down in its depths would do me unsadly
          one among many  deed doer raging 
          though sinless he saw me  not so could it happen
          when i in my anger upright did stand

          for every evil to the earlmen s destroyer

          thy land with my labors  he left and retreated 
          he lived his life a little while longer 
          yet his right hand guarded his footstep in heorot

          the friend of the scyldings  with gold that was plated 
          with ornaments many  much requited me

          we had sat us together  there was chanting and joyance 
          the age stricken scylding asked many questions

          joy telling wood  were touched by the brave one 
          now he uttered measures  mourning and truthful

          the age hoary warrior afterward began to
          mourn for the might that marked him in youth days 
          his breast within boiled  when burdened with winters
          much he remembered  from morning till night then

 beowulf hears of the havoc wrought by the dragon

 beowulf s retrospect  

           i survived in my youth days many a conflict 
          hours of onset  that all i remember 
          i was seven winters old when the jewel prince took me 
          high lord of heroes  at the hands of my father 
          hrethel the hero king had me in keeping 

 hrethel took me when i was seven  

          gave me treasure and feasting  our kinship remembered 
          not ever was i  any  less dear to him

 he treated me as a son  

          knight in the boroughs  than the bairns of his household 
          herebald and h thcyn and higelac mine 
          to the eldest unjustly by acts of a kinsman
          was murder bed strewn  since him h thcyn from horn bow

 one of the brothers accidentally kills another  

          his sheltering chieftain shot with an arrow 
          erred in his aim and injured his kinsman 
          one brother the other  with blood sprinkled spear 

 no fee could compound for such a calamity  

           twas a feeless fight  finished in malice 
          sad to his spirit  the folk prince however
          had to part from existence with vengeance untaken 

  a parallel case is supposed   

          so to hoar headed hero  tis heavily crushing   
          to live to see his son as he rideth
          young on the gallows  then measures he chanteth 
          a song of sorrow  when his son is hanging
          for the raven s delight  and aged and hoary
          he is unable to offer any assistance 
          every morning his offspring s departure
          is constant recalled  he cares not to wait for
          the birth of an heir in his borough enclosures 
          since that one through death pain the deeds hath experienced 
          he heart grieved beholds in the house of his son the
          wine building wasted  the wind lodging places
          reaved of their roaring  the riders are sleeping 
          the knights in the grave  there s no sound of the harp wood 
          joy in the yards  as of yore were familiar 

         gomelum ceorle           h  takes these words as referring to
    hrethel  but the translator here departs from his editor by
    understanding the poet to refer to a hypothetical old man  introduced
    as an illustration of a father s sorrow 

    hrethrel had certainly never seen a son of his ride on the gallows to
    feed the crows 

    the passage beginning  sw  bi  g omorlic  seems to be an effort to
    reach a full simile   as     so    as it is mournful for an old man 
    etc      so the defence of the weders        bore heart sorrow  etc  
    the verses      to          would be parenthetical  the poet s feelings
    being so strong as to interrupt the simile  the punctuation of the
    fourth edition would be better  a comma after  galgan          the
    translation may be indicated as follows    just  as it is sad for an
    old man to see his son ride young on the gallows when he himself is
    uttering mournful measures  a sorrowful song  while his son hangs for a
    comfort to the raven  and he  old and infirm  cannot render him any

wiglaf the trusty   beowulf is deserted by friends and by sword 


 wiglaf remains true  the ideal teutonic liegeman  

          the son of weohstan was wiglaf entitled 
          shield warrior precious  prince of the scylfings 
           lfhere s kinsman  he saw his dear liegelord
          enduring the heat  neath helmet and visor 
          then he minded the holding that erst he had given him 

 wiglaf recalls beowulf s generosity  

          the w gmunding warriors  wealth bless d homestead 
          each of the folk rights his father had wielded 
          he was hot for the battle  his hand seized the target 
          the yellow bark shield  he unsheathed his old weapon 
          which was known among earthmen as the relic of eanmund 
          ohthere s offspring  whom  exiled and friendless 
          weohstan did slay with sword edge in battle 
          and carried his kinsman the clear shining helmet 
          the ring made burnie  the old giant weapon
          that onela gave him  his boon fellow s armor 
          ready war trappings  he the feud did not mention 
          though he d fatally smitten the son of his brother 
          many a half year held he the treasures 
          the bill and the burnie  till his bairn became able 
          like his father before him  fame deeds to  complish 
          then he gave him  mong geatmen a goodly array of
          weeds for his warfare  he went from life then
          old on his journey   twas the earliest time then

 this is wiglaf s first battle as liegeman of beowulf  

          that the youthful champion might charge in the battle
          aiding his liegelord  his spirit was dauntless 
          nor did kinsman s bequest quail at the battle 
          this the dragon discovered on their coming together 
          wiglaf uttered many a right saying 
          said to his fellows  sad was his spirit 

 wiglaf appeals to the pride of the cowards  

           i remember the time when  tasting the mead cup 
          we promised in the hall the lord of us all
          who gave us these ring treasures  that this battle equipment 
          swords and helmets  we d certainly quite him 
          should need of such aid ever befall him 

 how we have forfeited our liegelord s confidence  

          in the war band he chose us for this journey spontaneously 
          stirred us to glory and gave me these jewels 
          since he held and esteemed us trust worthy spearmen 
          hardy helm bearers  though this hero achievement
          our lord intended alone to accomplish 
          ward of his people  for most of achievements 
          doings audacious  he did among earth folk 

 our lord is in sore need of us  

          the day is now come when the ruler of earthmen
          needeth the vigor of valiant heroes 
          let us wend us towards him  the war prince to succor 
          while the heat yet rageth  horrible fire fight 

 i would rather die than go home with out my suzerain  

          god wot in me   tis mickle the liefer
          the blaze should embrace my body and eat it
          with my treasure bestower  meseemeth not proper
          to bear our battle shields back to our country 
           less first we are able to fell and destroy the
          long hating foeman  to defend the life of

 surely he does not deserve to die alone  

          the prince of the weders  well do i know  tisn t
          earned by his exploits  he only of geatmen
          sorrow should suffer  sink in the battle 
          brand and helmet to us both shall be common 
             shield cover  burnie   through the bale smoke he stalked then 
          went under helmet to the help of his chieftain 

 wiglaf reminds beowulf of his youthful boasts  

          briefly discoursing   beowulf dear 
          perform thou all fully  as thou formerly saidst 
          in thy youthful years  that while yet thou livedst
          thou wouldst let thine honor not ever be lessened 
          thy life thou shalt save  mighty in actions 
          atheling undaunted  with all of thy vigor 

 the monster advances on them  

          i ll give thee assistance   the dragon came raging 
          wild mooded stranger  when these words had been uttered
            twas the second occasion   seeking his enemies 
          men that were hated  with hot gleaming fire waves 
          with blaze billows burned the board to its edges 
          the fight armor failed then to furnish assistance
          to the youthful spear hero  but the young ag d stripling
          quickly advanced  neath his kinsman s war target 
          since his own had been ground in the grip of the fire 

 beowulf strikes at the dragon  

          then the warrior king was careful of glory 
          he soundly smote with sword for the battle 
          that it stood in the head by hatred driven 
          n gling was shivered  the old and iron made

 his sword fails him  

          brand of beowulf in battle deceived him 
           twas denied him that edges of irons were able
          to help in the battle  the hand was too mighty
             which every weapon  as i heard on inquiry 
          outstruck in its stroke  when to struggle he carried
          the wonderful war sword  it waxed him no better 

 the dragon advances on beowulf again  

          then the people despoiler  third of his onsets  
          fierce raging fire drake  of feud hate was mindful 
          charged on the strong one  when chance was afforded 
          heated and war grim  seized on his neck
          with teeth that were bitter  he bloody did wax with
          soul gore seething  sword blood in waves boiled 

        the passage   brand     burnie    is much disputed  in the first

          then i heard that at need of the king of the people
          the upstanding earlman exhibited prowess 
          vigor and courage  as suited his nature 
             he his head did not guard  but the high minded liegeman s

          which the earth dwelling dragon erstwhile had wrought him
          to burn and to swell  he soon then discovered

          victorious saw  when the seat he came near to

          gold on the sea bottom  turn into vanity   
          each one of earthmen  arm him who pleaseth

          bare on his bosom the beakers and platters 
          as himself would fain have it  and took off the standard 
          the brightest of beacons     the bill had erst injured
           its edge was of iron   the old ruler s weapon 
          him who long had watched as ward of the jewels 
          who fire terror carried hot for the treasure 
          rolling in battle  in middlemost darkness 
          till murdered he perished  the messenger hastened 
          not loth to return  hurried by jewels 
          curiosity urged him if  excellent mooded 
          alive he should find the lord of the weders
          mortally wounded  at the place where he left him 
           mid the jewels he found then the famous old chieftain 
          his liegelord belov d  at his life s end gory 
          he thereupon  gan to lave him with water 
          till the point of his word pierc d his breast hoard

          thanks do i utter for all to the ruler 
          wielder of worship  with words of devotion 
          the lord everlasting  that he let me such treasures

 the hero s last gift 

          the bold mooded troop lord took from his neck then
          the ring that was golden  gave to his liegeman 
          the youthful war hero  his gold flashing helmet 
          his collar and war mail  bade him well to enjoy them 

 and last words  

           thou art latest left of the line of our kindred 
          of w gmunding people  weird hath offcarried
          all of my kinsmen to the creator s glory 
          earls in their vigor  i shall after them fare  
           twas the aged liegelord s last spoken word in
          his musings of spirit  ere he mounted the fire 
          the battle waves burning  from his bosom departed
          his soul to seek the sainted ones  glory 

        the word  oferh gian         being vague and little understood 
    two quite distinct translations of this passage have arisen  one takes
     oferh gian  as meaning  to exceed   and  inserting  hord  after
     gehwone   renders   the treasure may easily  the gold in the ground 
    exceed in value every hoard of man  hide it who will   the other takes
     oferh gian  as meaning  to render arrogant   and  giving the sentence
    a moralizing tone  renders substantially as in the body of this work 
     cf        et seq  

        the passage beginning here is very much disputed   the bill of the
    old lord  is by some regarded as beowulf s sword  by others  as that
    of the ancient possessor of the hoard    r gesc d          translated
    in this work as verb and adverb  is by some regarded as a compound

 wiglaf is sorely grieved to see his lord look so un warlike  

          it had wofully chanced then the youthful retainer

          the round twisted monster was permitted no longer
          to govern the ring hoards  but edges of war swords
          mightily seized him  battle sharp  sturdy
          leavings of hammers  that still from his wounds
          the flier from farland fell to the earth
          hard by his hoard house  hopped he at midnight
          not e er through the air  nor exulting in jewels
          suffered them to see him  but he sank then to earthward
          through the hero chief s handwork  i heard sure it throve then

    

 few warriors dared to face the monster  

          but few in the land of liegemen of valor 
          though of every achievement bold he had proved him 
          to run  gainst the breath of the venomous scather 
          or the hall of the treasure to trouble with hand blows 
          if he watching had found the ward of the hoard hall
          on the barrow abiding  beowulf s part of

          each of the twain had attained to the end of
          life so unlasting  not long was the time till

 the cowardly thanes come out of the thicket

          but blushing with shame  with shields they betook them 
          with arms and armor where the old one was lying 
          they gazed upon wiglaf  he was sitting exhausted 
          foot going fighter  not far from the shoulders
          of the lord of the people  would rouse him with water 
          no whit did it help him  though he hoped for it keenly 
          he was able on earth not at all in the leader

          the will of the wielder  the world ruler s power   
          would govern the actions of each one of heroes

          as best upon earth he was able to find him   

    

 surely our lord wasted his armor on poltroons  

          that he wildly wasted his war gear undoubtedly
          when battle o ertook him     the troop king no need had
          to glory in comrades  yet god permitted him

 with some aid  i could have saved our liegelord

          he waxed the weaker when with weapon i smote on
          my mortal opponent  the fire less strongly
          flamed from his bosom  too few of protectors
          came round the king at the critical moment

the messenger s retrospect 


 the messenger continues  and refers to the feuds of swedes and geats  

           the blood stain d trace of swedes and geatmen 
          the death rush of warmen  widely was noticed 
          how the folks with each other feud did awaken 
          the worthy one went then    with well beloved comrades 
          old and dejected to go to the fastness 
          ongentheo earl upward then turned him 
          of higelac s battle he d heard on inquiry 
          the exultant one s prowess  despaired of resistance 
          with earls of the ocean to be able to struggle 
           gainst sea going sailors to save the hoard treasure 
          his wife and his children  he fled after thenceward
          old  neath the earth wall  then was offered pursuance
          to the braves of the swedemen  the banner    to higelac 
          they fared then forth o er the field of protection 
          when the hrethling heroes hedgeward had thronged them 
          then with edges of irons was ongentheow driven 
          the gray haired to tarry  that the troop ruler had to
          suffer the power solely of eofor 

 wulf wounds ongentheow  

          wulf then wildly with weapon assaulted him 
          wonred his son  that for swinge of the edges
          the blood from his body burst out in currents 
          forth  neath his hair  he feared not however 
          gray headed scylfing  but speedily quited

 ongentheow gives a stout blow in return  

          the wasting wound stroke with worse exchange 
          when the king of the thane troop thither did turn him 
          the wise mooded son of wonred was powerless
          to give a return blow to the age hoary man 
          but his head shielding helmet first hewed he to pieces 
          that flecked with gore perforce he did totter 
          fell to the earth  not fey was he yet then 
          but up did he spring though an edge wound had reached him 

 eofor smites ongentheow fiercely  

          then higelac s vassal  valiant and dauntless 
          when his brother lay dead  made his broad bladed weapon 
          giant sword ancient  defence of the giants 
          bound o er the shield wall  the folk prince succumbed then 

 ongentheow is slain  

          shepherd of people  was pierced to the vitals 
          there were many attendants who bound up his kinsman 
          carried him quickly when occasion was granted
          that the place of the slain they were suffered to manage 
          this pending  one hero plundered the other 
          his armor of iron from ongentheow ravished 
          his hard sword hilted and helmet together 

 eofor takes the old king s war gear to higelac  

          the old one s equipments he carried to higelac 
          he the jewels received  and rewards  mid the troopers
          graciously promised  and so did accomplish 
          the king of the weders requited the war rush 
          hrethel s descendant  when home he repaired him 

 higelac rewards the brothers  

          to eofor and wulf with wide lavished treasures 
          to each of them granted a hundred of thousands
          in land and rings wrought out of wire 

 his gifts were beyond cavil  

          none upon mid earth needed to twit him   
          with the gifts he gave them  when glory they conquered 

 to eofor he also gives his only daughter in marriage  

          and to eofor then gave he his one only daughter 
          the honor of home  as an earnest of favor 
          that s the feud and hatred  as ween i  twill happen  
          the anger of earthmen  that earls of the swedemen
          will visit on us  when they hear that our leader
          lifeless is lying  he who longtime protected
          his hoard and kingdom  gainst hating assailers 
          who on the fall of the heroes defended of yore
          the deed mighty scyldings     did for the troopers
          what best did avail them  and further moreover

 it is time for us to pay the last marks of respect to our lord  

          hero deeds  complished  now is haste most fitting 
          that the lord of liegemen we look upon yonder 
          and  that  one carry on journey to death pyre
          who ring presents gave us  not aught of it all
          shall melt with the brave one  there s a mass of bright jewels 
          gold beyond measure  grewsomely purchased
          and ending it all ornament rings too
          bought with his life  these fire shall devour 
          flame shall cover  no earlman shall wear
          a jewel memento  nor beautiful virgin
          have on her neck rings to adorn her 
          but wretched in spirit bereav d of gold gems
          she shall oft with others be exiled and banished 
          since the leader of liegemen hath laughter forsaken 
          mirth and merriment  hence many a war spear
          cold from the morning shall be clutched in the fingers 
          heaved in the hand  no harp music s sound shall
          waken the warriors  but the wan coated raven
          fain over fey ones freely shall gabble 
          shall say to the eagle how he sped in the eating 
          when  the wolf his companion  he plundered the slain  
          so the high minded hero was rehearsing these stories
          loathsome to hear  he lied as to few of

 the warriors go sadly to look at beowulf s lifeless body  

          weirds and of words  all the war troop arose then 
           neath the eagle s cape sadly betook them 
          weeping and woful  the wonder to look at 
          they saw on the sand then soulless a lying 
          his slaughter bed holding  him who rings had given them
          in days that were done  then the death bringing moment
          was come to the good one  that the king very warlike 
          wielder of weders  with wonder death perished 
          first they beheld there a creature more wondrous 

 they also see the dragon  

          the worm on the field  in front of them lying 
          the foeman before them  the fire spewing dragon 
          ghostly and grisly guest in his terrors 
          was scorched in the fire  as he lay there he measured
          fifty of feet  came forth in the night time   
          to rejoice in the air  thereafter departing
          to visit his den  he in death was then fastened 
          he would joy in no other earth hollowed caverns 
          there stood round about him beakers and vessels 
          dishes were lying and dear valued weapons 
          with iron rust eaten  as in earth s mighty bosom
          a thousand of winters there they had rested 

 the hoard was under a magic spell  

          that mighty bequest then with magic was guarded 
          gold of the ancients  that earlman not any
          the ring hall could touch  save ruling god only 
          sooth king of vict ries gave whom he wished to

 god alone could give access to it  

              he is earth folk s protector  to open the treasure 
          e en to such among mortals as seemed to him proper 

        for  g da   which seems a surprising epithet for a geat to apply
    to the  terrible  ongentheow  b  suggests  gomela   the passage would
    then stand    the old one went then   etc  

        for  segn higel ce   k   th   and b  propose  segn higel ces  
    meaning   higelac s banner followed the swedes  in pursuit     s 
    suggests  s cc higel ces   and renders   higelac s pursuit    the
    h  so  reading  as translated in our text  means that the banner of
    the enemy was captured and brought to higelac as a trophy 

        the rendering given in this translation represents the king as
    being generous beyond the possibility of reproach  but some
    authorities construe  him         as plu   and understand the passage
    to mean that no one reproached the two brothers with having received
    more reward than they were entitled to 

        the name  scyldingas  here        has caused much discussion  and
    given rise to several theories  the most important of which are as
    follows      after the downfall of hrothgar s family  beowulf was king
    of the danes  or scyldings      for  scyldingas  read
     scylfingas   that is  after killing eadgils  the scylfing prince 
    beowulf conquered his land  and held it in subjection      m 
    considers      a thoughtless repetition of        cf  h  so  

        b  takes  nihtes  and  hw lum         as separate adverbial cases 
    and renders   joy in the air had he of yore by night  etc   he thinks
    that the idea of vanished time ought to be expressed 

        the parenthesis is by some emended so as to read        he   i e 
     god    is the hope of men          he is the hope of heroes    gr  s
    reading has no parenthesis  but says       could touch  unless god
    himself  true king of victories  gave to whom he would to open the
    treasure  the secret place of enchanters  etc   the last is rejected
