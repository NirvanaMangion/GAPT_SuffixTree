chapter i larry holt in paris larry holt sat before the caf de la paix watching the stream of life flow east and west along the boulevard des italiens the breath of spring was in the air the trees were bursting into buds of vivid green the cloud flecked skies were blue and a flood of golden sunshine brought out the colours of the kiosks and gave an artistic value even to the flaring advertisements crowded motor buses rumbled by little taxis dashed wildly in and out of the traffic to the mortal peril of unsuspecting pedestrians a gendarme with cloak over his shoulder stood in a conventional attitude on the kerb his hand behind him staring at nothing and along the sidewalk there were hurrying bareheaded girls slow moving old men and marching poilus itinerant vendors of wares loafed past the tables of the caf dusky faced arabs with their carpets on their arms seedy looking men who hawked bundles of picture post cards and would produce at the slightest encouragement cards which were not for the public gaze all these things and people were a delight to larry holt who had just returned from berlin after four years strenuous work in france and germany and felt in that holiday spirit to which even the mind of a detective will ascend the position occupied by larry holt was something of a mystery to the officials of scotland yard his rank was inspector his work was the administrative work of a commissioner and it was generally understood that he was in the line for the first vacant assistant commissionership that came along the question of his rank of his prospects did not trouble larry at that particular moment he sat there absorbing the sweetness of spring with every breath he drew his good looking face was lit up with the sheer joy of living and there was in his heart a relief a sense of rest which he had not experienced for many a long day he revealed himself a fairly tall man when he rose after paying the waiter and strolled round the corner to his hotel it was a slow progress he made his hands in his pockets his soft felt hat at the back of his head a half smile on his parted lips as he gripped a long black cigarette holder between his white teeth he came into the busy vestibule of the hotel the one spot in paris where people hustle and rush where bell boys really run and even the phlegmatic briton seems in a frantic hurry and he was walking towards the elevator when through the glass door leading to the palm court he saw a man in an attitude of elegant repose leaning back in a big chair and puffing at a cigar larry grinned and hesitated he knew this lean faced man so radiantly attired his fingers and cravat flashing with diamonds and in a spirit of mischief he passed through the swing doors and came up to the lounger if it isn t my dear old friend fred he said softly flash fred continental crook and gambler leapt to his feet with a look of alarm at the sight of this unexpected visitation hullo mr holt he stammered you re the last person in the world i expected to see or wanted to see said larry shaking his head reproachfully what prosperity why fred you re all dressed up like a christmas tree flash fred grinned uncomfortably but made a brave show of indifference i m going straight now mr holt he said liar you are and liar you will always be said larry without heat i swear to you on the book began fred vigorously if said larry without resentment you stood between your dead aunt and your failing uncle and took an oath on foxe s book of martyrs i wouldn t believe you he gazed admiringly at fred s many adornments at the big pin in his tie at the triple chain of gold across his neatly tailored waistcoat at his white spats and patent shoes and then brought his eyes back to the perfectly brushed hair you look sweet he said what is the game not he added that i expect you to tell me but it must be a pretty prosperous game fred the man licked his dry lips i m in business he said whose business are you in now asked larry interested and how did you get in with a jemmy or a stick of dynamite that s a new line for you fred as a rule you confine yourself strictly to picking crumbs of gold off the unwary youth of the land and he added significantly in picking the pockets of the recently deceased the man s face went red you don t think i had anything to do with that murder in montpellier he protested heatedly i don t think you shot the unfortunate young man admitted larry but you were certainly seen bending over his body and searching his clothes for identification said fred virtuously i wanted to find out who did it you were also seen talking to the man who did it said larry remorsefully an old lady a madame prideaux looking out of her bedroom window saw you holding him and then saw you let him go i presume he dropped fred said nothing at first he hated a pretended gentleman who descended to the vulgarity of employing the word drop for bribe that s two years ago mr holt he said i don t see why you should rake that thing up against me the examining magistrate gave me a clean bill larry laughed and dropped his hand on the man s shoulder anyway i m off duty now fred i m going away to enjoy myself you ain t coming to london i suppose asked the man looking at him quickly no said larry and thought he saw signs of relief i m going over to day said fred in a conversational tone i was hoping we d be fellow passengers i m grieved to shatter your hopes said larry but i m going in the other direction so long good luck said fred and looked after him with a face which did not indicate any desire for larry holt s fortune larry went up to his room and found his man brushing his clothes and laying them out on his bed patrick sunny the valet he had endured for two years was a serious young man with staring eyes and a round face and he grew suddenly energetic on larry s appearance he brushed and he hissed for he had been in a cavalry regiment larry strolled to the window and looked down on the place de l op ra at the busy scene sunny he said you needn t brush those dress things of mine pack em yes sir said sunny i m going to monte carlo by the night train indeed sir said sunny who would have said exactly the same if larry had expressed his intention of going to the sahara or the north pole to monte carlo sunny chortled larry for six bright happy expensive weeks start packing at once he picked up the telephone from the writing table and called the travel bureau i want a sleeper and a first class reservation for monte carlo by to night s train he said monte carlo he repeated louder no not calais i have not the slightest intention of going to calais thanks he hung up the receiver and stood looking at his servitor i hate talking to you sunny he said but i must talk to somebody and i hate your name who gave you that horrible name my forefathers said sunny primly continuing his brushing without looking up they rather missed the bus didn t they asked larry for if there is anything less like a bright spring day than you i should like to avoid it but we re southward bound sunny to this c te d azur to the land of flowers and folly to the orange groves do you like oranges sunny i prefer walnuts sir said sunny but fruit of any kind means nothing to me larry chuckled and sat on the edge of the bed we re going to be criminals and take people s money from them he said instead of nosing about the criminal practices of others no more robberies defalcations forgeries and murders sunny six weeks of dolce far niente i don t play that game myself sir said sunny i prefer cribbage larry picked up the afternoon paper and had turned its columns there were quite a few items of news to remind him of his profession and its calls there was a big bank robbery at lyons a mail coach had been held up in belgium by armed robbers and then he came to a paragraph the body of a man picked up on the steps leading down from the thames embankment has been identified as mr gordon stuart a rich canadian it is believed to be a case of suicide mr stuart had been spending the evening with some friends at the theatre and disappeared between the acts and was not seen again until his body was discovered a coroner s inquest will be held in due course he read the paragraph twice and frowned a man doesn t usually go out between the acts of a play and commit suicide unless the play is very bad he said and the obedient sunny said no sir he threw the newspaper down sunny i m getting into bad habits i m taking an interest in lunacy and for that same reason i notice that you ve folded my trousers so that the crease comes down the side unfold em you lazy devil he spent the afternoon making preparations for his journey and at half past six with his trunks in the hands of the porters and sunny carrying his overcoat he was settling his bill at the cashier s desk had folded up the receipt and was putting it in his pocket when a bell boy came to him monsieur holt he asked that s my name said larry and looked suspiciously at the thing in the boy s hand a telegram he said i don t want to see it nevertheless he took it in his hand and opened the blue paper with a disapproving grimace and read very urgent on special police service clear the line larry holt grand hotel paris very worried about stuart drowning stop case presents unusual features stop would be personally grateful if you would come over at once and conduct investigation it was signed by the chief commissioner who was not only his superior but his personal friend and larry put the telegram in his pocket with a groan what time do we arrive in monte carlo sir asked sunny when he joined him about this day twelvemonth said larry indeed sir said sunny politely interested it must be a very long way chapter ii sir john hason flash fred whose other name was grogan had a genuine grievance for after he had been solemnly assured by a reputable officer of the law that he intended going to monte carlo he had found him on the paris boat train and though he carefully avoided him he knew that larry was well aware that they were fellow passengers at victoria fred made a rapid exit from the station not being perfectly satisfied in his mind that larry s business in london was altogether unconnected with fred s own activities larry saw the disappearing back of the crook and smiled for the first time since he had left paris take my things to the flat he said to sunny i m going to scotland yard i may be home to night i may not be home until to morrow night shall i put out your dress things said sunny all that concerned him was the gentlemanly appearance of his employer to sunny the day was divided into three parts tweed broadcloth and pyjamas no yes anything you like said his master yes sir responded the obliging sunny larry drove straight to the yard and had some difficulty in making an entry because he was unknown to the local officials but presently he was ushered into the big room where sir john hason rose from his desk and came across to meet him with outstretched hand my dear larry he said it is awfully good of you to forgo your holiday you are a brick of course i knew you would come and i ve given you room forty seven and the smartest secretary i have seen in scotland yard for many a day they were old friends and old schoolmates john hason and larry holt and between the two men there was an affection and a confidence which is rarely found between men in the same profession i don t know forty seven said larry taking off his overcoat with a smile but i ll be happy to know the smartest secretary in scotland yard what s his name it isn t a he it s a she smiled hason miss diana ward who s been with me for about six months and is really the smartest and most reliable girl i ve ever had working with me oh a female secretary said larry gloomily then brightened what you say goes john and even this paragon of virtue doesn t worry me i suppose she s got a voice like a file and chews gum she is rather unprepossessing but looks aren t everything said sir john dryly now sit down old man i want to talk to you it is about this stuart case he began offering his cigarette box to the other we only discovered yesterday that stuart was a very rich man he has been living in this country for nine months at a boarding house in nottingham place marylebone he was a mysterious individual who went nowhere had very few friends and was extraordinarily reticent it was known of course that he had money and his bankers in london who revealed his identity when they discovered he was dead were in his secret that is to say his secret so far as his identity is concerned when you say he went nowhere what do you mean did he stay in the boarding house all the time i m coming to that said sir john he did go somewhere but why nobody knows every afternoon it was his practice to take a motor drive and invariably he went to the same place to a little village in kent about twenty five miles out he left the motor car at one end of the village walked through the place and was gone for a couple of hours we have made inquiries and we have discovered this that he spent quite a lot of time in the church an old saxon edifice the foundations of which were laid a thousand years ago regularly as the clock he d return after two hours absence get into the car which was hired and be driven back to nottingham place what was the name of the village beverley manor said the chief commissioner well to resume on wednesday night departing from his usual practice he accepted the invitation of a dr stephen judd to go to the first night of a new show at the macready theatre dr stephen judd is the managing director of the greenwich insurance company a small affair and quite a family concern but having a pretty good name in the city dr judd is a genial person who dabbles in art and has a very beautiful house at chelsea judd had a box for the first night of the show which is a perfectly rotten one judging by the newspaper notices box a stuart came and according to judd was very restless in the interval between the second and third acts he slipped out of the theatre unobserved and did not come back and was not seen again until we found his body on the thames embankment what sort of a night was it asked larry bright in the early part but rather misty and inclined to be foggy later said sir john in fact the constable who was patrolling that particular beat where the body was found reported that it was very thick between half past three and half past four larry nodded is there any possibility of his having mistaken his way in the fog and fallen into the water he asked none whatever replied sir john emphatically between the hour he disappeared and half past two in the morning the embankment was entirely clear of fog and he was not seen it was a very bright night until that hour and here is another curious circumstance the commissioner went on when he was discovered he was lying on the steps with his legs in the water his body being clear and he added slowly the tide was still rising larry looked at him in astonishment do you mean to say that he hadn t been deposited there by the falling tide he asked incredulously how could he be there with his legs in the water when the tide was low as it must have been when he came upon the steps that is my contention nodded sir john unless he was drowned immediately he left the theatre when the tide was high and was falling it seems almost impossible that he could have been left on the steps at daybreak when the tide was rising larry rubbed his chin that s queer he said there s no doubt about his being drowned none whatever replied the commissioner and pulled open a drawer lifting out a little tray on which were a number of articles these were the only things found in his pockets he said a watch and chain a cigar case and this roll of brown paper larry took up the latter object it was about an inch in length and was still sodden with water there is no writing on it said sir john i opened it when it first came in but thought it better to roll it back and leave it as it was for another inspection when it dried larry was looking at the watch which was an ordinary gold half hunter nothing there he said snapping back the case except that it stopped at twenty past twelve presumably the hour of his death sir john nodded the chain is gold and platinum mused larry and at the end is a what there was a little cylinder of gold about an inch and a half long a gold pencil fitted in here said larry have they found the pencil sir john shook his head no that is all we discovered apparently stuart was not in the habit of wearing rings i ll have these sent to your office now will you take on the case but what is the case asked larry slowly do you suspect foul play the commissioner was silent i do and i don t he said i merely say that here are the elements of a terrible crime but for the fact that he has been found on the steps with the tide still rising and it was obviously low when he died i should have thought it was an ordinary case of drowning and i should not have opposed a verdict of accidental death if the jury reached that conclusion larry looked at the watch again it s strange he said speaking half to himself and then i ll take these things into my room if i may i expected you would want them said the commissioner now will you see the body larry hesitated i ll see dr judd first he said can you give me his address sir john looked up at the clock over his mantelpiece he will be at his office he s one of those indefatigable persons who work late number bloomsbury pavement you can t miss the building larry gathered up the tray and moved to the door now for the unattractive secretary he said and sir john smiled chapter iii the secretary room no was on the floor above that where the commissioner s office was situated it lay at the end of a long corridor facing the detective he carried the tray in one hand and opened the door with the other walking into a comfortable little bureau hallo he said in surprise am i in the wrong office the girl who had risen from her desk was young and extremely pretty a mass of dull gold hair dressed low over her broad forehead gave an added emphasis to clear gray eyes that were regarding him with surprise she was neat and slim of figure and when she smiled larry thought he had hardly ever seen so gracious and pleasant a lady this is inspector holt s office she said good lord said larry coming slowly into the room and shutting the door behind him he went to the other desk and put down the tray and the girl looked puzzled this is inspector holt s office she repeated are those things for him larry nodded looking at the girl in wonder what is that he asked suddenly pointing to a glass and a jug on a side table which was covered with a small white cloth oh that is for inspector holt she said larry looked into the jug milk he said in wonder yes said the girl inspector holt is rather old you know and when i asked the commissioner if he would like something after his journey the commissioner suggested invalid s food and milk but i can t make invalid s food here and his shriek of merriment stopped her and she stared at him i am inspector holt he said drying his eyes you she gasped i m the lad said he complacently john the commissioner has played a joke on you miss i don t know your name now would you be good enough to ask the aged miss ward to step in a smile twitched her lips i am miss ward she said and it was larry s turn to stare then he put out his hand with a smile miss ward he said we re companions in misfortune each has been equally a victim of a perfidious police commissioner i m extremely glad to meet you and relieved i m a little relieved laughed the girl as she went to her desk and larry watching every movement thought she floated rather than walked sir john said you were sixty and asthmatic and told me to be careful that no draughts should come into the office i ve had a draught excluder specially fitted this afternoon larry thought a moment perhaps it s as well i didn t go to monte carlo he said and sat down at his desk now let us start shall we she opened her book and took up a pencil while larry examined the trinkets that lay on the tray take this down please he said watch made gildman of toronto half hunter jewel balanced no a no scratches on the inside he opened the case and snapped it again then tried the stem winder wound less than six hours before death took place she looked up is this the stuart case she asked yes said larry do you know anything about it only what the commissioner s told me she replied poor man but i m getting so used to horrors now that i m almost hardened i suppose one feels that way if one s a medical student i was a nurse for two years in a blind asylum she added and that helps to toughen you doesn t it she smiled i suppose it does said larry thoughtfully and wondered how young she had been when she started to work for her living he put her at twenty one and thought that was a fairly generous estimate of her age do you like this work he asked she nodded i love it she said sir john says that one of these days he s going to make me a she hesitated for a word a sleuth don t say you re going to be a sleuth begged larry i thought we had this business to ourselves female competition to day she shook her head you re neglecting your work mr holt she said i ve got as far as the watch he chuckled a little and resumed his inspection chain made of platinum and gold length twelve inches swivel at end and container of a gold pencil at least i presume it was gold he dictated the pencil wasn t found no she said i particularly asked the sergeant who brought the goods whether the pencil had been found larry looked at her in surprise did you notice that oh yes i noticed that too said diana calmly the knife has gone too he looked across at her in genuine amazement what knife he asked i guessed it was a knife said she the swivel is too large to be attached to a pencil only if you look you will see a little ring it has probably got entangled with the ring holding the pencil it was broken when it came in but i pressed it together it looked as if somebody had wrenched it off i guessed the knife she said because men so often carry a little gold penknife there or a cigar cutter suggested larry i thought of that she said nodding but they d hardly have taken the trouble to nip off a cigar cutter they he asked whoever killed stuart she said quietly would have removed all weapons from his possession he looked at the chain again and saw the other ring and wondered why he had not noticed it before i think you re right he said after a further examination the ring is much larger it had slid up the chain by the way and there are distinct scratches where the knife was wrenched off hm he put down the object on the table and looked at his own watch have you seen the rest of the things he asked she shook her head i ve only examined the watch he looked around for some receptacle and saw a cupboard in the wall is this empty he asked and she nodded then we ll leave the examination of these until i come back i have to see somebody he slipped the tray into the closet and locked the door handing the key to the girl he was halfway to the door when he remembered you won t be here when i come back i suppose you have some sort of office hours i make it a practice never to stay after two o clock in the morning she said gravely she met the frank admiration in his eyes without embarrassment i don t think i have ever met a girl like you he said slowly and as though he were speaking his thoughts aloud she flushed and dropped her gaze then she laughed and looked at him again and he thought that her eyes were like stars it may be that we have never met anybody like each other she said and larry holt left scotland yard conscious that a new and very potent interest had come into his life chapter iv flash fred sees a client flash fred had seen larry holt off the premises of the railway terminus for though he had left the station building first he had waited until larry s taxi had gone he had a particular desire that he should not be shadowed that evening and to this was engrafted a wholesome respect for the perspicacity and genius of larry holt on the continent of europe whereever crook met crook it was generally and unanimously agreed that the first person they wished to meet on the other side of the styx was larry holt only they did not say on the other side of the styx they said simply and crudely in hell the ruthlessness of this man once he got his nose on to the trail was a tradition and a legend and fred more than any other man had reason to fear him he gave holt ten minutes start and then doubled back to the station left his suitcase at the cloak room and came out at one of the side entrances where the cabs were ranked and choosing the first of these he gave an address ten minutes later he was set down in a quiet bloomsbury square devoted in the main to lawyers offices there was an exception to these the building at which he alighted was a narrow and tall erection of red brick and though no light showed in the lower office there was a subdued gleam in the windows of the upper floor a commissionaire on duty in the hall looked at fred askance the office has been closed for hours sir he said shaking his head we open at nine in the morning is dr judd on the premises asked flash fred shifting his cigar from one corner of his mouth to the other the commissionaire hesitated mr judd is still busy sir and i don t think he wants to see anybody oh you don t don t you sneered fred now you go upstairs to the governor and tell him that mr walter smith wants to see him don t forget the name it s an unusual one he added humorously the commissionaire looked dubiously at the visitor i shall only get into trouble he grumbled as he stepped into one of the two small elevators and pressing the automatic knob he went quickly up out of view apparently mr judd s office was situated on the top floor for it was some time before the whine of the motor ceased after a while it began again and the commissionaire descended he ll see you sir he said will you step this way you ought to know me by now sergeant said fred as he walked into the lift i ve been here pretty regularly the past few years maybe i wasn t on duty said the commissionaire as the lift slowly ascended there are two of us here you know were you a friend of mr david s sir fred did not chuckle he did not even smile no no he said airily i don t know mr david ah very sad very sad said the commissionaire he died suddenly four years ago you know sir fred did know but he did not confess the fact the death of mr david had robbed him of a possible source of income by right whereas now he only had that income by favour and might at any time lose that and gain a term of imprisonment if the jovial dr judd grew tired of paying blackmail the lift stopped and he stepped out and followed the commissionaire to a door at which the uniformed man knocked a loud voice bade them come in and flash fred swaggered into the handsome apartment with a cool nod to its occupant dr judd had risen to meet him all right sergeant he said to the commissionaire and flicked a silver coin across the room which the man caught deftly get me some cigarettes he said and when the door had closed sit down you rascal said dr judd good humouredly i suppose you ve come to get your pound of flesh he was a tall stout man florid of face and heavy of build his forehead was bald his eyes were deep set and wide apart he had about him an air of comfort and boisterous good humour fred in no wise abashed sat down on the edge of a chair well doctor he said i m back dr judd shook his head and searched his pockets for a cigarette what do you want a cigarette said fred reaching for his case but the doctor shook his head and his smile was broad good humoured but significant no thank you mr grogan he said with a chuckle i don t smoke cigarettes that are presented to me by gentlemen of your profession what is my profession growled flash fred you don t think i was trying to dope you do you i was expecting you said the other without answering the question and seated himself if i remember rightly you have a strong objection to taking cheques flash fred grinned quite right governor he said that is still my weakness the doctor took a bunch of keys from his pocket walked to the safe snapped back the lock and then looking over his shoulder you needn t watch this too closely my friend except when i have to pay blackmailers i never keep money in this safe fred made a little grimace hard words never killed anybody he said sententiously the doctor took out a packet slammed the door and turned the key came slowly back to the desk and threw down a fat envelope then he consulted a little book which he took from a drawer you re three days ahead of your time he said and fred nodded admiringly what a brain you ve got for figures doctor he said yes i m three days ahead of my time but it s because i ve got to get out of england pretty quick to meet a friend of mine in nice the doctor threw the packet across to him and he caught it clumsily there are twelve hundred pounds in that envelope you needn t count them because they re all there said dr judd and leaning back in his chair he took out a golden toothpick eyeing the other straightly and thoughtfully of course i am the biggest fool in the world he said or i would never submit to this iniquitous blackmail it is only because i want to keep the memory of my dead brother free from calumny that i do this if your brother goes shooting up people in montpellier and i happen to be on the spot said flash fred unctuously and help him to escape as i did and i can prove it i think i m entitled to a little compensation you re an unutterable scoundrel said the other in his pleasant way and smiled and you amuse me suppose instead of being what i am i were a bad minded man suppose that i was desperate and couldn t find the money why i might do anything he guffawed at the thought of doing anything very terrible it wouldn t make any difference to me said fred but it wouldn t make any difference to you either i ve got all the facts written down about that shooting how i helped the man escape and recognized him in london as mr david judd when i came back and my mouthpiece has got it your lawyer sure my lawyer said fred nodding he leaned forward you know i didn t believe your brother had died i thought it was a fake to get me out of the way and i shouldn t have believed it if i hadn t seen it in the papers and been to the funeral dr judd rose and replaced his toothpick that a man like you could besmirch a name like his he said all the good humour had gone out of his voice and he trembled with indignation and passion he had passed to the other side of the table and stood glowering down at flash fred and fred who was used to such scenes for this was not his first blackmailing case merely smiled he was the best man that ever lived the cleverest the most wonderful said dr judd and his face was white the greatest man perhaps that this world has seen his voice shook with the intensity of his emotion and for you he reached down and before fred knew what had happened the big hand had gripped him by the collar and jerked him to his feet here none of that cried fred and strove to break loose the money i do not mind paying judd went on it is not that which maddens me it is the knowledge that you have it in your power to throw mud at a man here his voice broke and the other hand came up with a cry like a wild beast fred flung himself back with all his might and broke the grip of his adversary suddenly as if by magic there appeared in his hand a revolver put em up and keep em up damn you and then a voice the gentlest voice in the world asked can i be of any assistance fred turned with a start larry holt was standing in the doorway an engaging smile upon his face chapter v the will flash fred looked upon the intruder a picture of comical amazement you don t lose no time do you the protest was forced from him and larry laughed softly for carrying concealed weapons you re pinched fred it s no crime in this country growled the other putting up his gun by this time dr judd had recovered himself you know our friend mr grogan he said easily he s a member of our amateur dramatic society and we were practising a scene from the corsican brothers i suppose it looked rather alarming thought it was julius c sar said larry dryly the scene between cassius and brutus though i don t remember the gun play the doctor looked at flash fred and then at larry i m afraid i don t know you he said he was still rather white but his tone had recovered its good nature i am inspector larry holt from scotland yard said larry now seriously dr judd are you charging this man with anything no no no said judd with a laugh honestly we were only doing a little harmless fooling larry looked from one to the other the managing director of an insurance company even a small company does not fool with a known criminal you know this man i suppose i ve met him several times said judd easily you know also that he s a member of the criminal classes and that he is in fact flash fred who has served penal servitude in this country and a term of imprisonment in france the doctor said nothing for a while i m afraid i guessed that too he said in a low voice and in consequence my association with the man must seem rather curious to you but i cannot explain larry nodded the one perturbed person in the room was flash fred he was in an agony of apprehension lest dr judd tell his secret and the reason for his visit but judd had no such intention you can go now he said curtly and fred trying to summon up some of his old swagger lit a cigar with a hand that trembled and larry watched the operation you want nervine for the nerves fred he said i saw a chemist s shop open at the corner of the street when i came along fred walked out with a pitiable attempt at indifference and larry watched him go then he turned to the doctor i m sorry i came in at such an inconvenient moment he said though i don t think you were in any danger fred gets all his fine dramatic effects by pulling not by shooting i don t think so either said the doctor with a laugh sit down mr holt i certainly didn t expect to see you i work rather late here at nights there was nobody down below when i came said larry and that is my excuse for coming up unannounced the doctor nodded i sent the commissionaire out to buy me some cigarettes and here he is there was a tap at the door and the commissionaire came in and laid a packet on the table in confirmation now what can i do for you asked judd as he took a cigarette from the packet and lit it i suppose it is the stuart case i ve seen one of your men to day larry nodded it is the stuart case he said i wanted a few additional details i ve only just taken charge of the business and interrupted my investigation of the remains in order to see you before you left the office i know very little said the doctor smoking comfortably he came with me to the theatre the night before last a queer quiet reticent man i met him quite by accident as a matter of fact i was in a car that collided with his taxicab and i was slightly injured he called upon me and that is how the friendship began if you can call it a friendship tell me about the night before last asked larry and the doctor looked up at the ceiling now let me think i can give you the exact time almost for i am a somewhat methodical person i met him at the entrance to the theatre at seven forty five and we both went into box a that is the last box on the left or o p side the box is on a level with the street the stalls and pit being below the level we sat there through two acts and then just before the curtain came down on the second act he made an excuse and went out of the box and he was never seen again none of the attendants saw him no said the doctor but that i think is easily explained it was a first night and as you know the attendants are very interested in the action of a play and fill the doorways and the entrances to gangways looking at the stage when of course they should be attending to their business did you know he was stuart a semi millionaire asked larry i hadn t the slightest idea said the doctor truthfully i knew nothing whatever about his past life except that he had come from canada larry was disappointed i hoped i was going to get a lot of information from you he said nobody seems to have known stuart and naturally i thought that you would have been in his confidence neither i nor his bank manager was in his confidence said the doctor it was only this morning that i heard from the manager of the london and chatham that he was a client of theirs we knew absolutely nothing of him except that he had plenty of money a few minutes later larry was walking down bloomsbury pavement and he was a very thoughtful man what had flash fred been doing in that office what was the significance of that flashing of the revolver and the white face of dr judd it was another little mystery into which he had not time to investigate and any way it was no concern of his ahead of him his iron shod stick tapping the pavement was a man who walked slowly and deliberately larry passed him and waiting for a cab which he had signalled saw him again blind he noted casually not interrupting his thought of fred and the doctor but he had no time for side trails and side issues and entering the cab he drove to westminster he was not going back to the yard immediately first he had a gruesome little duty to perform at the westminster mortuary whither the cab had taken him he found two scotland yard officers awaiting him the examination of the body was a brief one the only mark was an abrasion of the left ankle and then larry began an inspection of the clothing which had been placed in an adjoining room there is the shirt sir pointing to a garment which had been roughly folded i can t understand those blue marks on the breast larry carried the garment under a light it was a dress shirt rough dried and the purple specks on the breast were clearly visible made by an indelible pencil said larry and in a flash remembered the missing pencil case but what meant those specks which formed three rough lines of indecipherable pothooks and hangers and then the solution came to larry and quickly he turned the dress front inside out and uttered an exclamation written on the inside were three lines and it was the indelible pencil markings which had soaked through that had caused the speckly appearance of the front of the shirt the water had made the purple pencil markings run but the words were distinct in the fear of death i gordon stuart of merryhill ranch calgary leave all my possessions to my daughter clarissa and i pray the courts to accept this as my last will and testament gordon stuart underneath was written it is now clear to me that i have been betrayed by there followed a letter which looked like an o but at this point the writing abruptly terminated larry raised his eyes and met those of his subordinate here is the strangest will that has ever been made he said in a hushed voice he put down the shirt and walked back to the mortuary chamber and again examined the body one hand was clenched and evidently this fact had been overlooked by the doctors using all his strength he forced the fingers apart and something fell with a tinkle to the stone floor he stooped and picked it up it was a broken sleeve link of a peculiar pattern the centre was of black enamel the rim was of tiny diamonds he made a further inspection without discovering anything new then he looked at his companion and his forehead was wrinkled what did this mean what association had all these circumstances with each other they could be connected he felt sure of that the strange encounter between flash fred and dr judd the will on the shirt and now this new clue an atmosphere of impenetrable mystery enveloped this case like a fog behind which strange and inhuman shapes were moving dimly glimpsed and as dimly suspected murder he knew it he felt it every shadowy shape he passed on his way to his office whispered the word murder chapter vi the writing in braille the girl was making tea on an electric stove when he came in hallo he said with a start i had forgotten you and she smiled tell me he asked quickly did stuart have any cuff links she nodded and took a small packet from her table the commissioner forgot to send these on they came in just after you left she said he opened the paper the links were of plain gold without crest or monogram he took the enamel and diamond half link from his pocket and inspected it what is that she asked did you find it in she hesitated he nodded i found it in his hand he said quietly then it is murder you think i m certain said he it will be most difficult to prove and unless a miracle happens the villain who committed this crime will go free he opened the cupboard and took out the tray adding to the collection the two gold links and the half link he had found in the dead man s hand nothing at all he said shaking his head then he remembered he had not examined the little roll of brown paper i don t know what this is it was found in his pocket he flattened it out on the table and the girl came to the opposite side and bent over looking at the paper as he smoothed it out it was a strip about four inches long and two wide nothing written here he said and turned it over nor here i ll have it photographed to morrow one moment she said quickly and took the paper from his hand passing the tips of her delicate fingers over its surface he saw her face go white i thought so she whispered i was almost sure of that when i saw the embossing what is it he asked quickly there are some words here written in braille the language of the blind she said and again her fingers went over the surface pausing now and again with a puzzled frown on her face braille he repeated in amazement and she nodded i used to read it when i was in the institute she said but some of these words have been damaged probably by the water some are distinct will you write them down as i spell them he snatched up a pen pulled a piece of paper from the rack and waited even in that moment he thought how curiously the positions had been reversed and how he had become the secretary and she the detective the first word is murdered she said and then there is a space and then the word dear then there s another gap and the word sea occurs and that is all with this weird message between them they stared at one another what blind man amidst those blind shades which had mouthed and gibbered to him in the fog had sent this message what was there behind the ragged scroll of soaked paper whose link did the dead man hold in his stiffened hand why was he murdered there had been money in his pocket his possessions were untouched it was not for robbery that he had been struck down not for vengeance for he was a stranger one fact stood out one tangible point from whence larry knew his future movements would radiate murder he said softly and i ll find the man who did it if he hides himself in hell chapter vii a telegram from calgary diana ward was looking at her chief with a new interest in her fine eyes braille he said in a low voice that is the written language of the blind isn t it she nodded yes there are books and newspapers printed in that type she said it is a sort of embossed character made of a number of small dots the relation of one with the other producing the letter she took up the paper again when blind people write they use a small instrument and a guide but this has been written in a hurry by somebody who worked without any guide i can feel how irregularly it is done and the illegibility of the words which i cannot read is due almost as much to bad writing as to the action of the water he took this curious clue into his hands and examined it could stuart have done it with his pencil she shook her head and then asked quickly have you found the pencil no said larry grimly but i ve found what the pencil was used for he opened the parcel he had brought in and showed the shirt and its tragic message written inside the front why inside he said thoughtfully it s written on the left too diana understood it would necessarily be written on the left side if he used his right hand she said but why on the inside she shook her head i don t know it would have been much simpler to i have it cried larry triumphantly he wrote this will where it would not be seen by somebody or other if it had been written outside it would have been seen and probably destroyed she shivered a little i m not quite hardened yet she said with a smile there is something terrible about this isn t there i think you are right and if we go on that assumption that he wrote this will in such a manner in order to keep it from the eyes of a third person we must suppose that that third person existed in other words there was somebody of whom he was afraid or if you like at whose hands he feared death and the murder was premeditated for he must have been in the custody of that somebody for some time before he met his dreadful end she stopped suddenly for larry s eyes were fixed on her and she dropped her own and flushed you re rather wonderful he said softly and if i m not jolly careful i m going to lose my job he saw a look of doubt in her eyes and laughed now miss ward he said banteringly we are going to start fair and you must acquit me of any professional jealousy jealousy she scoffed that would be absurd not so absurd said larry i ve known men to be jealous of women for less reason and now he glanced at his watch i think you had better go home i ll get a taxi have you far to go only to the charing cross road she said then i ll take you home said larry it s nearly one o clock she had already started putting on her coat and her hat thank you i ll go alone she said it isn t far really mr holt i don t want you to get into the habit of taking me home every time i m late i m quite used to being out by myself and i won t have a taxi we ll see about that said larry he was writing rapidly on a cable form if i can get this cable through in time it ought to reach the chief of police in calgary by tea time yesterday yesterday she said in surprise oh of course they are nine hours late on greenwich time and larry groaned i ll have to try some new ones on you he said they walked home together but as it happened the girl s tiny apartment lay in the direction that he had to take larry reached regent s park where his own flat was situated and found the patient sunny laying out his pyjamas sunny said larry as clad in these garments and his flowered dressing gown he sipped a cup of chocolate somewhere in this city is a very unpleasant gentleman name unknown i expect there are many like that sir said sunny and somewhere in england is a man who is known as the public executioner and it s my job in life to bring them together he was at scotland yard at half past eight the following morning and to his surprise the girl was before him and the departmental memoranda and the various documents which come to every head of scotland yard were neatly arranged on his blotting pad a cablegram has just come in said the girl i didn t open it you must tell me what you want done about cables and telegrams open em all said larry i have no private business and the only scented notes which come to me can be read without bringing a blush to the youngest cheek she came across the room with the cablegram in her hand and he took it calgary he said looking at the address that s pretty quick work and then his mouth opened in amazement for the telegram read stuart had no child he was not married he looked at the girl check number one he said she took the telegram from him and examined the hour at which it was dispatched this is a common knowledge telegram she said what do you mean by common knowledge asked larry good humouredly well it must have been answered just as soon as it arrived and the man who sent this wrote from what is common knowledge in other words he didn t attempt to make any investigations but took the fact for granted probably he asked somebody in the office is stuart married or a bachelor and when they said he was a bachelor he dispatched the reply larry folded the wire and put it away in his desk if it is common knowledge that stuart was not married it merely complicates a situation which is not exactly clear here is a man who dies and is obviously murdered and in a few moments preceding his death writes his will secretly on the inside of his shirt it is possible by the way that he may have done this in the presence of his murderers without their being aware of the fact and i should think that is most likely i thought that she agreed he was murdered and writes his will on the stiff breast of his shirt leaving the whole of his property to his daughter now a sane man and there is no reason to suppose that he was anything but sane does not invent a daughter on the spur of the moment so it is obvious that the chief of the calgary police is wrong it is equally certain that if he was married it was not in calgary or even in canada where the fact would be known said the girl secret marriages are possible in a great city but in small places amongst very prominent people and apparently he lived not in a town but on a ranch the fact that he was married could not escape knowledge on the way home the previous evening larry had told the girl almost all that the commissioner had told him it was not usual for him to make confidantes so quickly but there was something very appealing about diana ward and his confidence usually a matter of slow growth had come to maturity in a flash the girl was looking thoughtfully down at her desk if he was married secretly she said slowly would it not be in in london of course said larry nodding send a cable to the chief of the calgary police asking him particulars about stuart s known movements when he was in london last before his present visit chapter viii the memorial stone she nodded took out a telegram form from her rack and began writing larry glanced through the reports mechanically initialled one and put the others aside then he opened the cupboard and taking out the tray carried it to the table he examined the watch again in the light of day the swivel ring the cigar case and lastly the roll of paper by daylight the embossed characters were visible and he put his finger tips over them very gingerly he was not however accustomed to reading braille and he realized that his hand was a heavy one compared with the delicate touch of his secretary she had finished her writing had rung a bell and handed the telegram to him to read that s all right said larry and when the uniformed messenger had come and taken the telegram away do you notice anything peculiar about this piece of paper he asked pointing to the braille message yes she said i was looking at it before you came you don t mind she asked quickly and larry laughed you can examine anything except my conscience he said did you notice he turned his attention to the paper again that one end of this paper is less discoloured than the other i noticed that one end was drier than the other last night she said and that of course is the reason it was on the dry end that we got our best results for instance the word murderer was almost untouched by the water it was damp but not moist he nodded and she opened a drawer of her desk and took out a sheet of brown paper i brought this with me she said it is a sheet from a braille book and i was trying experiments with strips i had torn from the book soaking them in my wash basin here is the result she took out a little roll of shapeless pulp which skinned when she attempted to unwind it humph said larry they had both reached the same conclusion but by different processes she by actual experiment he by deduction and the conclusion they had come to was that the roll of paper had been placed in gordon stuart s pocket after the body had left the water there would be enough moisture in the cloth to saturate it through said larry this paper is very absorbent almost as much so as blotting paper so we have come to this that gordon stuart was drowned and after he was drowned his body was handled by some person or persons one of whom slipped this message into his pocket and that person was either a blind man or one who believed he stared at her by jove he said as a thought struck him what were you going to say she asked is it possible he frowned it was an absurd idea the man or woman who left this message on the body expected that diana ward would read it she held no official position and the fact that she was larry holt s secretary was a purely fortuitous circumstance which could not have been anticipated by any outside person yet a hasty telephone call to the chief of internal intelligence revealed the fact that there was no braille expert at scotland yard the only man who knew the system being at that time on sick leave for six months i think you can dismiss the idea that the message was intended for me said the girl with a smile no it was written by a blind man or it would have been written better a person with the use of his eyes or suppose he were writing in the dark asked larry he put the tray away and locked the cupboard the girl shook her head if he were not blind he would not be in possession of the instrument to make these markings she said and larry felt that was true he spent two hours dictating letters to various authorities and at eleven o clock he rose and put on his coat and hat we re going for a joy ride he said we she repeated in surprise i want you to come along said larry and this time his tone was authoritative and the girl meekly obeyed there was a car waiting for them at the entrance to the yard and the driver evidently had already received his instructions we re going to beverley manor the village which stuart was so fond of visiting he said i particularly want to discover what attractions the old saxon church had for this unhappy man he doesn t seem to have been an arch ologist so the fact that the foundations were a thousand years old would not interest him it was a glorious spring day with just a sufficient nip in the air to bring the colour to young and healthy cheeks the hedgerows were bursting into vivid green and the grassy banks were yellow with primroses they sat silent this man and woman whom fate had thrown together in such strange circumstances enjoying the golden day and thankful of heart to be alive in that season of renewal all the world was living the air was lively with hurrying birds going about their business of nest making they saw strange furtive shapes creeping across the road from burrow to burrow and in one sheltered old world garden which they passed white lilacs were blooming beverley manor was a straggling village at the foot of the kentish rag beyond its church it had few attractions for visitors for it lay off the main kentish road a tiny backwater of rural england where life ran a smooth unruffled course they pulled up at the inn where larry ordered lunch and then they set forth on foot to the church which lay a quarter of a mile away along a white and pleasant road it was not a pretty church its square tower was squat and unlovely and successive generations endeavouring to improve its once simple lines had produced a medley of architecture in which romanesque gothic and norman struggled for recognition it rather swears doesn t it said larry irreverently as they passed through the old lych gate into the churchyard the door of the church was open and the edifice was empty however disturbing its outside might be there were serenity and peace and simplicity in the calm interior larry had hoped to find memorial tablets placed in the wall of the church which would give him some clue to stuart s movements but beyond a brass testifying to the virtues of a former vicar and the tomb of an ancient bishop of rochester the church was innocent of memorials larry then began a systematic inspection of the graves most of them were very old and their inscriptions indecipherable he came at last to the far end of the cemetery where half a dozen workmen were carrying a new stone wrapped in canvas and he and the girl stood side by side watching them in silence as they deposited their load by a well kept grave i m afraid we ve had our journey for nothing said larry we ll make a few inquiries in the village and then we ll go back to london he was turning to go when one of the men stripped the canvas covering from the headstone we might as well know who this is said larry and stepped forward to look the men stood on one side to give him a better view and he read and reading gasped to the memory of margaret stuart wife of gordon stuart of calgary can died may th also his only daughter jeane born th june died st may the girl had joined him now and together they stood staring down at the headstone his only daughter said larry in a tone of bewilderment his only daughter then who is clarissa chapter ix the man who lost a finger an examination of local records produced no satisfactory result margaret stuart had died at a farm three miles out of beverley manor and the farm had changed hands twice since the date of her death twenty years ago said the farmer whom larry interviewed why twenty years ago this place was a sort of nursing home it was run by a woman who took in invalids where the woman is he could not say she was not a local woman he thought he had heard she was dead i ve been racking my brains to recall her name said the farmer i told the gentleman yesterday that he d best go to somerset house a gentleman here yesterday said larry quickly was there somebody inquiring yesterday yes sir a man from london said the farmer he came down in a car and offered me fifty pounds if i could tell him the name of the woman who kept this place as a home and a hundred pounds if i could give him any information about a lady that died here twenty two years ago a lady named stuart oh indeed said larry alert now nobody from scotland yard had made the inquiries he was well aware what was this gentleman like who called yesterday he asked rather a tall man said the farmer i didn t see his face properly because he had his overcoat buttoned up to his chin but i did notice that he d lost the little finger on his left hand on their way back to london both larry and diana ward were absorbed in their own thoughts the car was threading through the traffic of westminster bridge road before larry made any reference to their visit who is in such a frantic hurry to discover all about the stuarts he asked and will give fifty pounds for information and who is his daughter clarissa and how can he have a daughter clarissa when his only daughter lies at beverley manor you inquired at the stonemason s when we came through beverley didn t they tell you anything asked the girl he nodded the stone was put up by order of mr stuart who was in the habit of coming to the churchyard every day to sit beside the grave the memorial was ordered two months ago and the stone was seen and approved by gordon stuart only last week he bit his lip thoughtfully between last week and the night of his murder stuart must have discovered that he had another child he shook his head that sort of thing doesn t happen he said decisively not in real life anyway he spent ten minutes with the commissioner and afterwards went into the city and the girl did not see him till seven o clock that night she had had instructions from him that she was not to wait as it was a saturday and her office hours ended at one but she was sitting at her desk reading when he came in and he was so elated that he did not reprove her i ve got it he said exultantly the murderer she asked with a start no no the story of stuart has there been any reply to my cablegram diana shook her head it doesn t matter very much he said briskly as he paced the office i ve secured the registration of the marriage it occurred in august and was celebrated at a church in highgate don t you see what happened i don t quite see she said slowly well i ll tell you gordon stuart a young man at the time was on a visit to this country i have found that he stayed at the cecil hotel from june to august he married the girl whose name was margaret wilson and returned to the cecil hotel alone in march there is a record there that he left for canada two days after he came back to the hotel they keep a book in which they write down the addresses to which letters should be forwarded and there was no difficulty whatever in tracing his movements so far then i went to see the vicar of the church where he was married and here i had a great find he paused rumpled his hair and frowned i really should like to know who is that tall man who has lost the little finger of his left hand he said irritably why she asked in surprise he had been there a day before me said larry and then shaking off his annoyance here is the story the story told by stuart to the vicar whom he met in the strand on the day before he sailed for canada never to return until he came back eight or nine months ago the vicar married him and remembered the circumstances very well he said stuart was a very nervous and somewhat conceited man who lived in terror of his father a rich landowner in canada stuart confessed to him over a cup of tea which they had together at the cecil that he was leaving his wife and going back to canada to break the news of his marriage to his father he was in considerable doubt as to what his father would say or to be more exact he had no doubt whatever that the old man would kick up a shine the impression left on the vicar s mind was that the old man would disinherit him to cut a long story short he said he was leaving london the next day and at the first opportunity he should tell his father and then he would return for his wife there s no doubt in my mind larry went on that stuart did not tell his father that he kept the secret of his marriage carefully hidden and in a panic at being found out he broke off all communication with his wife the girl shook her head one doesn t want to judge the dead too harshly she said but it was not a manly thing to do i agree said larry it wasn t sporting he must have left his wife a considerable sum of money at any rate when the vicar saw her she was in comfortable circumstances and gave him that impression stuart left in march in june three months later his child was born the child he never saw and about whom in all probability he never heard until years of remorse worked upon him and he came back to england to find his wife and establish her in the position to which she was entitled he must have employed an inquiry agent and the end of his quest was a discovery in the churchyard of beverley manor the grave of his wife and his only child what about clarissa asked the girl and larry shrugged that is mystery no which has got to be cleared up she was silent this thoughtful girl and her pretty brows were wrinkled in perplexity presently she put down the pen she had been so assiduously biting and looked across at him with a slow triumphant smile a smile which found a ready response in his face you ve solved it he asked eagerly and she nodded you ve solved the mystery of clarissa i think it s one of the easiest of the problems to solve she said calmly and i must have been silly not to have thought of it before have you the registration of birth i haven t got that we re making a search for it to morrow said larry i can save you the trouble replied diana ward clarissa is the other twin daughter twins gasped larry and the girl nodded her eyes dancing with merriment at his surprise obviously she said poor mrs stuart had twin daughters one of them died the other is clarissa of whom stuart learnt perhaps in the last few hours of his life larry looked at her in awe when you are chief commissioneress of the metropolitan police he said i shall be very obliged to you if you make me your secretary i feel i have a lot to learn chapter x mr strauss drops flash fred had not left london he had no intention of leaving london if the truth be told he had certain doubts in his mind which he had determined to set at rest certain obscurities on his horizon which he desired should be dispersed flash fred was a clever man if he had not been clever he would not have lived in the excellent style he adopted nor possessed chambers in jermyn street and a motor brougham to take him to the theatre at night his working expenses were heavy but his profits were vast he had many irons in the fire and burnt himself with none of them which is the art of success in all walks of life on the evening of the day that larry had made his discovery flash fred in the seclusion and solitude of his ornate sitting room had elaborated a theory which had followed very close upon a discovery he had made that morning men of his temperament and uncertain prospects suffer from a chronic dissatisfaction this dissatisfaction is half the cause of their departure from the straight and narrow path and is wholly responsible for their undoing a hundred pounds a month payable yearly is a handsome income but the underworld abhor anything that savours of steadiness regularity and system three qualities which are so associated with prison life that they carry with them a kind of taint particularly distressing to the lag who was twelve hundred pounds a year for five years is six thousand pounds or twenty four thousand dollars at the present rate of exchange a respectable sum but five years represents a big slice taken out of the hectic life of men like flash fred twelve hundred pounds at best represents only two coups at trente et quarante and can be lost in three minutes dr judd was a collector it had been reported to fred that dr judd s residence at chelsea was a veritable treasure house of paintings and antique jewellery fred had read a newspaper paragraph that dr judd was the possessor of historical gems worth fifty thousand pounds though fred had no passion for history he had an eye to the value of precious stones and the theory he had evolved was in the main arithmetical if he could get away with ten thousand pounds worth of property in twenty four hours he would not only have anticipated his income for eight or nine years but he would be saved the fag of coming to london every twelve months to collect it much might happen in twelve months it might not always be possible for him to make the journey since prison authorities are notoriously difficult to persuade or he might be dead to get that movable property would be difficult because the doctor was hardly the kind of man to leave his property unguarded indeed the ordinary methods of effecting an entrance were repugnant to fred s professional feelings for he gained his livelihood by the cleverness of his tongue and the lightning adjustment of certain brain cells to meet emergencies and to him a jemmy was an instrument of terror since it implied work but there was another method and once he had made his get away would the doctor dare prosecute that afternoon sauntering aimlessly through piccadilly circus at the midday hour he had come face to face with a tall stoutish man who after one glance at him had attempted to avoid a meeting but fred had caught him by the arm and swung him round why he said if it isn t old no how are you strauss mr strauss s face twitched nervously i think you ve made a mistake sir he said come off it demanded fred vulgarly and taking him by the arm led him down lower regent street excuse my not recognizing you said mr strauss nervously but i thought at first you were a bull split we call them in this country well i m not said flash fred and how has the old world been treating you hey do you remember g gallery at portland in b block the face of the stout man twitched again he did not like being reminded of his prison experience though in truth he had little against the prisoner who had occupied the adjoining cell how are you getting on he asked and it happened that that morning flash fred had gone out without any visible diamonds he carried them in his hip pocket for he trusted nobody bad said fred which was a lie but no good crook admits that he is prosperous then suddenly why did you think i was a split strauss strauss looked uncomfortable oh i just thought so he said awkwardly are you at the old game fred looked at the other steadily and saw his eyes shift no i m going straight now he said a liar you are and a liar you will always be said fred quoting larry holt i ll bet you re on the way to fence something again the man looked round as though seeking a way of escape and fred who never despised an opportunity however small held out a suggestive palm and said laconically drop only a few things said mr strauss hurriedly things that were given to me or wouldn t be missed just odds and ends like a couple of salt spoons he enumerated his loot drop said fred again i m hard up and want the money i ll take a share and you shall have the money back one of these days mr strauss dropped with a curse come and have a drink said fred briskly when the transaction had been completed to his satisfaction you ve left me with about three pounds worth grumbled the man really mr grogan i don t think you re fair and he looked at the other suspiciously and you don t look as if you re hard up either appearances are deceptive said the cheerful fred and led the way into a private bar what are you now valet or butler butler replied strauss tossing down a dram it s not a bad place mr grogan call me fred begged flash fred it seems a liberty said strauss and meant it i ve got a butler s job with a very nice gentleman he said rich mr strauss nodded yards of it he said briefly but what s the good he knows i m a lag and he s very decent to me fred was eyeing him narrowly you still dope i see he said and the man flushed yes he said gruffly i take a little stimulant now and again well said fred who is your boss you wouldn t know him mr strauss shook his head he s a city gentleman head of an insurance office dr judd asked flash fred quickly why yes said the other in surprise how did you know they parted soon after and flash fred was a thoughtful man for the rest of the day and his plans began to take shape toward the evening he dressed himself with care after dark and strolled strandwards for he numbered amongst his other accomplishments that of an experienced squire of dames he had a ready smile for the solitary girl hurrying homewards and though the rebuffs were many such conquests as he had to his credit added to the pleasures of memory between st martin s church and the corner of the strand he drew blank for such girls as he saw were unattractive or were escorted opposite morley s hotel he saw a peach he caught one glimpse of her under a light standard and was transfixed by the rare beauty of her face she was alone and fred swung round and in two strides had overtaken her haven t we met before he asked raising his hat but asked no more somebody caught him by the collar and jerked him back fred i shall really have to be severe with you said the hated voice of larry holt and fred developed an instant grievance haven t you got a home to go to he wailed and continued his journey to the strand in a bitter mood for the romance had been shaken out of him and he could still feel the knuckles of the shaker at the back of his neck the girl passed on unconscious of the fact that larry holt had been behind her it was not an unusual experience to be spoken to in the street and she had grown hardened to that also she lived above a tobacconist s shop in the charing cross road and larry saw her open the side door and go into the dark passage he waited for a few minutes then continued his walk this girl had made an extraordinary impression upon him he told himself that it was not her delicate beauty or anything about her that was feminine but that it was her genius her extraordinary reasoning faculties which attracted him and to do him justice he believed this he was not a susceptible man beautiful women he had known on both sides of the border line which separates the good from the bad the honest from the criminal he had had minor affairs in his youth but had come through those fiery dreams unscorched and unmarked by his experiences so he told himself it was extraordinary that it was necessary to tell himself anything but there was the indisputable fact that he spent a great deal of his spare time in arguing out his attitude of mind toward diana ward and he had known her something over twenty four hours diana ward was not thinking of larry as she went into her flat her mind was wholly occupied by the problems which the stuart case presented she felt that if the missing clarissa were found they would be on the high road to discovering the cause of stuart s death and the reason for this hideous crime she slammed the door and went up the dark and narrow stairs slowly the upper part of the tobacconist s was let off in three flats and she occupied the highest and the cheapest the tenants of the other two were she knew spending the week end in the country the first floor was occupied by a bachelor civil servant a hearty man whose parties occasionally kept her awake at night the second floor by a newspaper artist and his wife and she had no reason to complain of her neighbours she had reached the second landing her foot was on the stairs of the final two flights when she stopped she thought she had heard a noise the faint creak of a sound which she had felt rather than heard she waited a second and then smiled at her nervousness she had heard these creaks and whispers before on the dark stairs but had overcome her timidity to discover that they were purely imaginary nevertheless she walked up a little more slowly and reached the landing from whence rose a short flight of stairs to her own apartments the landing was a broad one and as she turned with one hand on the banisters she put out the other in a spirit of bravado as though she groped for some hidden intruder and then her blood turned to water for her hand had touched the coat of a man she screamed but instantly a hand a big unwholesome hand covered her face and she was drawn slowly backward she fought and struggled with all her might but the man who held her had almost superhuman strength and the arm about her was like a vise then suddenly she went limp and momentarily the arm that held her relaxed fainted have ye said a harsh voice and as a hand came feeling down for her face the other arm relaxed a little more with a sudden dart the girl broke free ran up the remaining stairs and opened and slammed the door there was a key on the inside and this she turned with a heart full of gratitude that she had never locked her bedroom door from the outside she flew across the room stopping only to switch on the lights pulled out a drawer and took from its depths a small revolver diana ward came from a stock which was not easily scared and though her heart was pounding painfully she ran back at the door and flung it open she stood for the space of a few seconds she heard a stealthy footstep on the stairs and fired there was a roar of fear and a blunder of feet down the stairs only for a moment did she hesitate and then raced down the stairway in pursuit she heard the thump of feet on the landing lower down heard the rattle of the door and came down the last flight to find it open and nobody in sight concealing the revolver in a fold of her dress she stepped out into the charing cross road at this hour there were few pedestrians and she looked round for some sign of her assailant a light motor van was driving away and the only person she saw near at hand was an old blind man the iron ferrule of his stick came tap tap tap as he stumbled painfully along pity the blind he wailed pity the poor blind chapter xi burglars at the yard sunny said larry to his servitor london is a terrible city indeed it is sir said mr patrick sunny but it has one bright radiant feature which redeems it from utter desolation and abomination i think you re right sir said sunny i ve often noticed that myself sir i m very fond of the picture houses myself i m not talking about the picture houses snapped larry nothing is further from my thoughts than the cinema houses i am talking of something different something spiritual would you like a whisky and soda sir asked sunny at last securing a tangible line get out roared larry bubbling with laughter get out you horrible materialist go to the pictures yes sir said sunny but it s rather late then go to bed said larry stop a bit bring me my writing case he was wearing his favourite indoor kit a dressing gown a pair of old cricketing trousers and a soft shirt and now he filled his polished brier with a sense of physical well being believe me sunny said larry holt impressively there are many worse places than london on a bright spring day when your heart there was a faint rat tat tat on the outer door a visitor at this time of night said larry in surprise it could not be from scotland yard because scotland yard use the telephone freely a little too freely sometimes i think there s somebody at the door sir said sunny that s a fine bit of reasoning on your part said larry open it he waited and heard a brief exchange of questions the visitor was a woman and before he could guess who it was the door opened and diana ward came in he saw by her face that something had happened and went to meet her what is the matter he asked quickly that man didn t follow you what man she demanded in surprise flash fred she shook her head i don t know whether it was flash fred she said grimly but if he is somebody particularly unpleasant it was probably he sit down would you like some coffee i m just going to have a cup sunny get two coffees yes sir said sunny and then significantly do you want me to go out to the pictures sir larry blushed angrily get some coffee you you you he spluttered now what is it the girl told the story of her adventure without preliminary larry listened with a serious face you say he was big that rules out flash fred he said do you think it was a burglar somebody who had broken in and whom your arrival interrupted i don t think so she shook her head in fact i know that it was a much more serious attack when i got back to my flat i went through all the rooms in the dining room the room to which i would have gone first in ordinary circumstances i found a long laundry basket a laundry basket he repeated in surprise she nodded it was lined with a sort of quilting very thick and the lid was padded in the same way inside of it was this she laid down the object she had been carrying it looked like an airman s cap except that there was no opening for the mouth he took it up and sniffed though there was no need for this for he had noticed the sweet scent when she had come into the room it is saturated in chloroform he said of course this would not make you entirely insensible but it would have quieted you he paced the room his hands in his pockets his chin on his chest did you find anything else when i got out into the street she said a laundry van was just moving off i noticed it particularly because i thought all the time that the word laundry and that was all the inscription the van bore had been written by an amateur and very badly done i can t understand it said larry bewildered the brute couldn t have got you away he must have had some assistants in the house i don t agree with you she said quietly this man was terribly strong i felt like an infant in his arms and it would have been a very simple matter for him to slide the basket down the stairs and carry it out across the pavement with the help of the man who was driving the van but why you he asked bewildered why should they bother about you she did not reply immediately i am wondering she said at last whether i have by accident stumbled upon some clue which incriminates the stuart murderers perhaps without knowing that i have such a clue i am in possession of information which they wish to suppress larry was very thoughtful just wait here a little while and i ll change he said and disappeared from the room the girl looked round the cosy flat appreciatively and sunny came in bearing a tray first stopping outside the door to cough loudly to the intense annoyance of larry who heard him from the other room will you have sugar miss asked sunny solemnly and when she nodded some ladies don t like sugar it makes them fat i m not very much afraid of getting fat she smiled no ma am you wouldn t be said sunny agreeably on the way to the flat she asked larry laughingly if sunny agreed with everything he said with everything i ve ever said said larry he drives me to despair sometimes i have yet to find the subject upon which sunny has an independent definite opinion later he was to discover there was at least one matter in which sunny had a mind of his own but that time was distant they came to the apartment in charing cross road and larry began his search he had brought a flash lamp with him and inspected every stair without however coming upon a single clue that would identify the mysterious assailant now we ll have a look at your room he examined the laundry basket which the girl had exactly described nothing new here he said see if anything is missing she made an independent search and came back to him in the sitting room with a puzzled face my green coat an overcoat i wear and a hat have disappeared a distinctive hat he asked quickly what do you mean by a distinctive hat she asked in surprise is it rather striking it is rather she smiled it is a golden yellow hat which i wear with my green coat he nodded have you worn it to the yard he asked often she replied in surprise then that s it said he come down with me i don t want to leave you alone she followed him into the street and he went into the nearest telephone booth and rang up scotland yard and got the officer on duty at the door has miss ward been in to night it is inspector holt speaking he asked yes sir was the reply she s just gone out larry groaned but i haven t been to scotland yard she said in surprise somebody has impersonated you he said shortly they were in the grim building on the thames embankment within a few minutes and the door of was apparently untampered with he opened the door and switched on the lights oh yes he said softly for the doors of the cupboard wherein he had kept the clues concerning the death of stuart hung broken upon their hinges he pulled out the tray and gave a rapid glance at its contents the braille writing had disappeared chapter xii fanny weldon tells the truth he lifted the telephone and presently send the first two officers in the building he said and a messenger quick the girl was watching interestedly now she saw the real larry holt the man of whom it is said by the commissioner that he slept trailing at his request she stood outside the open door whilst he conducted an investigation the light jemmy which the intruder had used he had not troubled to take away it lay on the floor and he picked it up with a piece of paper and carried it to the light a short thread of cotton adhered to its rough end which meant that its user had worn cotton gloves to avoid finger prints his only hope was the tray it was a flat glass tray with wicker sides and handles and he knew that if the gloves came off anywhere it would be here for a person unaccustomed to working in gloves would remove them to examine the smaller objects and his surmise was right when he breathed on the polished back of the gold watch a distinct thumb print was visible by this time two officers had arrived is there a man on duty in the print department asked larry yes sir replied the officer take this watch down hold it by the stem if he cannot bring up the print by powder i want it photographed and verified within the next hour the burglar had made another faux pas larry had pulled out the waste paper basket without disturbing its contents and had taken out three screwed up pieces of paper two of which proved to be nothing more important than memoranda in diana s writing the third however was a plan of the room drawn in ink by a skilful hand the cupboard being marked and the positions of the desks shown they thought there were three cupboards here said larry pointing there is one supposed to be on the left of the fireplace he looked up and raised his eyebrows by jingo they re right he said and another behind the door he looked and nodded they know this room much better than i do miss ward he said and looked at the paper again the man who drew this has a knowledge of architectural drawing said he i think we d better have a safe and a bodyguard he added bitterly somebody appeared in the doorway it was sir john hason who sometimes returned to his office at night to take advantage of the quiet and freedom from interruption which the evening hours afforded what has happened larry he asked oh nothing said larry airily only a burglar has broken into scotland yard don t you think we ought to send for the police he asked sardonically and sir john grinned but the smile came off his face instantly they haven t taken the stuart clues have they the only clue that matters replied larry it would be a good idea if we brought some boy scouts into this building to look after our movable property i like you when you re funny said the commissioner but he was serious we ll have the doorkeeper up the doorkeeper when he came could give no satisfactory explanation except that he had thought it was miss ward who had passed it was the practice to call the number of the room when its occupants came in for duty and this was also the custom after office hours the visitor had said and had been allowed to pass unchallenged there have been no strangers here have there asked larry no said the girl and then there was a blind man here this afternoon you remember you wanted to see the instruments these poor people use and i asked the little old man who sells matches on the embankment to come up larry remembered at any rate he couldn t have made a plan of the room he said the system seems to be a little bit groggy said sir john when the doorkeeper had gone we can t really blame this man it is our own fault there s hardly enough light in the main hall to read a newspaper placard complained larry here is the finger print gentleman the officer who came up had a broad smile the smile of a man who had justified his hobby got it first time sir he said fanny weldon coram street here s her record he handed the card to larry twice gaoled for impersonation he read that s the woman but how did she come into this game the officer who had taken the watch away and who now restored it supplied the information fanny s a queer woman sir he said she hasn t a spark of originality and she s had all her trouble through helping other people in their schemes big joe jaket employed her to impersonate miss lottie home the actress about two years ago and then she was employed by somebody else to impersonate a barmaid whilst the landlord was away when the mannic gang cleared out three thousand from the hotel victor hugo larry was sitting at the table his chin in his palm thinking that is what has happened he said these people have got track of all the crooks in london and it s just as likely they ve employed fanny no coram street i think you said we ll see what fanny has to say for herself he did not see fanny until daylight no coram street was a corner house apparently rented out in rooms soon after daybreak a cab drew up to the kerb outside the door and a woman stepped out and paid the driver as she walked to the door larry came behind her and took her arm she turned round with an exclamation of fright she was a pretty woman with a shrewish mouth here what are you doing she asked in alarm you re coming for a little walk with me said larry is it a cop she asked going pale a fair cop said larry and still holding her elbow led her to the nearest police station where diana and his officers were waiting on the way to the station she bewailed her fate this comes of being obliging she said bitterly what s the charge sacrilege said larry solemnly and she was astonished sacrilege what do you mean breaking into a church or something breaking into scotland yard said larry she drew a long breath then it is a cop she said you ve said it replied her captor they put her in the steel pen but not before she had been searched by one of the woman attendants the search produced in bank notes which fanny who had now recovered her good spirits insisted should be counted i ve lost things in police stations before she said significantly she was not taken to the cells but in a little waiting room larry and diana interviewed her and the presence of diana was a source of great interest to the prisoner you ve brought your young lady along i see she said flippantly she was gamine right through despite her smart clothes and her elaborate jewellery is this the lady i took off she s the identical lady said larry now fanny i m going to talk to you like a father go ahead and don t mind me said fanny recklessly but i can tell you that i ve been going straight for months and larry grinned i should like to draw a line alongside that straight course of yours he said it d be a bit bumpy fanny i m going to give you a chance and i shall be perfectly frank with you scotland yard doesn t want the world to know that a female hook has broken in under its nose and pinched certain articles of value the woman laughed softly and catching diana s eye winked it takes a woman to do that sort of thing eh dearie she asked proceed with your story mr busy fellow but if you think i m going to give anybody away why you re making a mistake you will give away just what i want you to give away said larry sharply you are going to tell me who employed you to do this job she shook her head you will also tell me who was the man to whom you handed the stuff and where again she shook her head but she was in a good humour there is no use in asking me questions she said i m not going to answer you can put me into the cell just as soon as you like and save yourself a lot of trouble i ll put you into the cell after i ve charged you said larry quietly and the woman looked up sharply you have charged me with breaking and entering she said that is not the crime which i shall bring against you said larry if i get no satisfaction from you now i shall take you back to the pen and charge you with being an accessory to the murder of gordon stuart on the night of the twenty third of april she looked at him speechless murder she repeated good gawd you don t mean that i m in you re in bad said larry you re assisting murderers to escape the processes of justice you were employed to steal a very important clue which the police held and which might have led to the conviction of the murderer and that is sufficient offence to bring you under the gravest suspicion she was serious now do you mean that she asked i do indeed said larry earnestly see here fanny i don t want you to think i m kidding you i m giving it you as straight as it s possible for one human being to give a thing to another you went out to steal the clue which might have led to the arrest of the murderers what is your name she asked i am inspector larry holt and she gasped suffering moses then i am in bad she said i thought you were abroad now mr holt i ll tell you i ve heard a lot about you and i m told that you always play straight with a hook i knew nothing about this job until yesterday afternoon and then i had a telephone call asking me to meet big jake or blind jake as they call him blind jake repeated larry to whom the name was new and then he recalled the blind match seller on the embankment who had come to his office but it could not be he diana had said he was a small man your men know all about him mr holt fanny hesitated he s a wicked man now that sounds funny coming from me but if you know what i mean he s just wicked i m scared to death of blind jake and there isn t a hook in london who isn t he s been inside twice once for unlawfully wounding and once for being in possession of property there used to be three of em all hooks together and all blind we used to call em the blind eyes of london because they could get about quicker than you and in a fog they d beat the best detectives that ever lived because fog never means anything to them blind jake used to be the boss of the three and then one of em disappeared and i heard he was dead we never heard much about them for twelve months and then blind jake turned up again with yards of money i believe he is working for a big boss well you met blind jake yes she nodded he gave me the plan not his own he couldn t draw interrupted larry not him said the woman contemptuously no he brought the plan with him i ve got it somewhere maybe it s in the bag you ve taken don t worry about the plan said larry i found that in the office well blind jake told me how to go about it said he would give me a coat and a hat that this young lady always wore when she went to the yard and i got instructions that i was to say when i went into the room and run upstairs quick what were you told to get a little roll of brown paper said the woman they told me where it was and almost how it was placed in the tray she shrugged her shoulders i can t guess how they knew i can said larry and turned to the girl the little old match seller recovered his sight where can i find blind jake he asked the woman you won t find him she said shaking her head he never comes out by day at least very seldom what is he like in appearance very big and as strong as an ox diana uttered an exclamation has he a beard she asked yes miss said the woman a little grayish kind of beard it was the man on the stairs said diana i am certain of it larry nodded well he said addressing the woman when did you hand over the stuff about two o clock this morning that was the time he said i was to meet him at the lower end of arundel street in the strand near the embankment and a pretty fine temper he was in too do you know where he lives asked larry she shook her head years ago they used to live in todd s home she said that s an institute in lissom lane paddington where they used to look after the blind hawkers but i don t think he s there now larry took the woman back to the charge room you can release her on my recognizance he said fanny you will report to me to morrow morning at scotland yard at ten o clock yes sir said fanny what about my money larry thought a moment you can take that he said if anybody tells me said fanny as she collected and counted her notes with offensive care that the police are dishonest i shall have something to say chapter xiii todd s home my dear said larry gently you really must go home and go to bed diana shook her head laughingly i really am not tired mr holt she said won t you let me go along with you you know you promised to keep me in this case i didn t promise to keep you up all night he said good humouredly and you re looking a wreck i don t think i shall do anything much more this morning except sleep said he now off you go there s a providential taxi crawling this way he said and whistled she was feeling desperately tired and she knew his words were the words of wisdom but she made one last ineffectual protest larry was adamant the cab drew up and he opened the door for her sergeant harvey will go home with you he said and drew harvey aside go upstairs to miss ward s room search it thoroughly and remain on duty on the lower landing until you re relieved he watched the cab out of sight then turned to the second officer who had accompanied him now sergeant he said i think we will investigate todd s home it was some time before they found another taxi and larry had a constitutional objection to walking six o clock was booming out from the church towers when the cab put them down before todd s home it was a bleak unlovely house the windows covered with blue wash a long black board covering the width of the house was inscribed in faded gold letters todd s home for the indigent blind larry expected he would have some difficulty in making the inmates hear but he was mistaken for hardly had he knocked when the door was opened by a little man that s not toby and not harry and not old joe he said loudly who is it larry saw that he was blind i want to see the superintendent he said yes sir said the man in a tone of respect just wait here will you he went down a long passage full of turns and angles so that he disappeared from sight and presently they heard him shuffling back in his slippered feet and behind him walked a tall man wearing a white clerical collar his eyes were covered with dark blue glasses and he too felt his way along the passage won t you please come in he said in an educated voice he was a man of powerful build and his clean shaven face denoted a strength of character out of the ordinary i am john dearborn the rev john dearborn he explained as he led the way we have few visitors here alas i m afraid todd s home is not very popular he did not speak resentfully but cheerfully and as one who had a great spirit nor did he make allusion to the early hour they had chosen it is a little farther along gentlemen he said i know there are two of you because i can hear your footsteps mind the step this way he pushed open a door and they went in the room was cosily furnished and the first thing that larry noticed was the bare condition of the walls and then he remembered with a little pang that the blind have no need for pictures a curious little instrument stood by the side of the table which was the principal article of furniture in the room and a tiny wheel was spinning as they came in the superintendent walked unerringly to the machine there was the snap of a button and the wheel ceased to revolve this is my dictating machine he explained turning to them with a smile i am engaged in literary work and i can dictate to this cylinder which is then transferred to an operator who types from my voice larry expressed polite interest now gentlemen said the rev john dearborn as he seated himself to what am i indebted for the honour of this visit i am an officer from scotland yard said larry and my name is holt the other inclined his head i hope none of my unfortunate men have been getting into trouble he asked i don t exactly know yet said larry at present i am searching for a man called blind jake blind jake repeated the other slowly i don t think we have had such a name in the home since i have been in charge i ve been here for four years he explained it used to be run and very badly run by a man who got together quite the worst type of blind men in london you know that the blind are wonderful and heroic and the majority of them are positively an inspiration to those who have sight but there are a class of men so afflicted who are the scum of the earth you have probably heard of the dark eyes not until this morning said larry and the other nodded we have got rid of those people and we have now very respectable old hawkers who come here where everything is done for them you would like to see the home you don t know blind jake i have never heard of him said the rev john dearborn but if you will come with me we will make inquiries the home consisted of four dormitories and a common room and in this latter reeking with tobacco smoke sat the inmates of the home larry looked round and could scarcely repress a shiver just one moment said mr dearborn when he had ushered the two men into the passage he returned shortly shaking his head nobody there knows blind jake though one has heard of him they ascended to the first dormitory i don t suppose you want to see any more said mr dearborn larry raised his head i thought i heard somebody groaning yes yes a sad case said the superintendent there are cubicles upstairs for those men who can afford to pay a little more than their fellows in one of them we have a man who i fear is going out of his mind i have had to report the case to the local authorities may we go upstairs asked larry with pleasure said the rev dearborn after a moment s hesitation the only thing i am afraid of he said as he led the way is that the language of this man will distress you in a little cubicle lay a wizened man of sixty who tossed desperately to and fro in his bed and all the time he was talking talking to some invisible person and larry watching him wondered brute coward muttered the man on the bed you ll swing for it mark my words you ll swing for it it is very terrible said the rev john dearborn turning away and shaking his head this way gentlemen but larry did not move all right jake you ll suffer too mark my words you ll suffer let them do their dirty work i didn t put the paper in his pocket i tell you larry took a step into the cubicle and bending over shook the man let go my arm you re hurting it said the man on the bed and larry released his hold wake up he said i want to speak to you but the man went talking on and larry shook him again leave me alone growled the old man i don t want to have any more trouble what is your name asked larry i don t want any more trouble said the man he s quite delirious said john dearborn he is under the impression that he s accused of a practical joke on one of his friends downstairs but he said jake said larry there is a jake below jake horley would you like to see him he s a little fellow and rather amusing disappointed larry walked down the stairs and took farewell of his conductor i am very glad to have had a visit from the police said john dearborn i only wish that we could persuade other people to come to us you have seen some of our work and some of the difficulties with which we are faced before you go he added perhaps you will tell me why you are seeking blind jake the men will be consumed with curiosity to know the reason for this police visit that is easy to satisfy smiled larry there is a charge against him made by a woman to the effect that she was employed by him to commit a felony the police officer who was with him gasped for it is not the practice of the police to give away their informants larry opened the door himself and paused with his hand upon the handle pardon my asking what may be a very painful question mr dearborn he said gently are you afflicted oh yes said the other cheerfully i am quite blind i wear these glasses from sheer vanity i think they improve my appearance he laughed softly good bye said larry shaking his disengaged hand and then he pulled the door open and came face to face with flash fred flash fred was dumbfounded and he walked backwards down the few steps at some peril to himself larry surveyed him his head on one side like an inquisitive hen are you following me or am i following you he asked gently and why this early rising fred have you been out all night at your business for once fred had no words he had walked all the way from jermyn street to paddington and had been very careful to see that he had not been followed at last he found his voice so it was a trap was it he said bitterly i might have guessed it but you ve got nothing on me mr holt i have several things on you said larry pleasantly he had unconsciously closed the door of the home behind him i don t like your face i don t like your jewels i positively loathe your record what is the idea fred have you called to deliver a contribution is your conscience pricking you stow that stuff mr holt growled fred and to larry s surprise began walking away with him aren t you going to the home he asked no i m not snapped fred they walked on in silence fred between the two police officers and his thoughts were very busy they had reached the broad thoroughfare of edgware road before he had completed his mental exoneration i don t know what you ve got me for you can t pinch me for ancient istory in moments of perturbation fred suffered certain lapses of style h istory corrected larry for the matter of that i don t know why you re with us but since you ve forced yourself upon us and since there s nobody to see the disgraceful company i keep i will endure you fred stopped short do you mean to tell me that i m not pinched he asked incredulously so far as i am concerned you are not said larry unless sergeant reed has a private engagement with you not me sir smiled sergeant reed who told you you were pinched fred well that beats it said fred aghast what was the game don t you know somebody at the home i don t know it from a cowshed said fred i had to inquire my way of a milkman you should have asked a policeman murmured larry there are plenty about there are too many about for me replied flash fred vindictively here mr holt he said with sudden seriousness you re a gentleman and i know you wouldn t put me wrong larry passed the compliment without comment well he said and fred dived into his inner pocket and produced a letter what do you make of this sir he asked larry opened the letter which was addressed to fred grogan and began they are going to arrest you to morrow larry holt has the warrant for execution come to todd s home in lissom lane at half past six in the morning and ask to see lew and he will give you information that will help you to make a get away don t allow yourself to be shadowed or tell anybody where you are going it was unsigned and larry folded the letter and was about to give it to fred do you mind if i keep this he asked no sir i don t mind but mr holt will you tell me he demanded nervously is there any truth in that yarn of my being pinched larry shook his head so far as i know you are not on the list and certainly i have no warrant for you fred he said in fact you have such a good record just now that if you ran straight you could pretty well live without fear of the police sounds damned uninteresting to me said flash fred as he slouched off and larry let him go chapter xiv fanny has a visitor no coram street was an apartment house and mrs fanny weldon occupied two rooms one facing coram street and one a side turning she lived well and she paid well gave little or no trouble and the breath of scandal did not touch her name not noticeably she was in truth the star boarder and her landlady would have gone very far to oblige fanny always providing that the fair name of was not assailed this woman crook had spent a busy night yet sleep refused to come to her in the day and she rose at three in the afternoon and busied herself with those occupations which women of all kinds find interesting she had a hat to trim some dainty silk to iron a little mending and a little darning you were up late last night mrs weldon said the landlady bringing her tea with her own hands fanny nodded to be exact i wasn t in bed all night she said i went to a dance what time is it six o clock i thought you were sleeping and as you didn t ring i didn t disturb you i m going to bed early to night said fanny yawning is there anything fresh no my dear said the landlady professionally maternal we ve got a new young gentleman in the opposite room she jerked her thumb at the door a gentleman from manchester and very quiet mrs hooper made some trouble about the dinner she retailed grisly gossip of the boarding house send me up something cold on a tray said fanny i am going to bed early i have a very important appointment to morrow she was looking forward to her appointment with larry holt in no great spirit of enthusiasm it was half past seven when the woman undressed slowly and went to bed she was deadly tired and she fell asleep almost before her head touched the pillow the dreams of evil doers are no more unsound as a rule than the dreams of the pure and virtuous but fanny was over tired and dreamt badly ghastly dreams of monstrous shapes of high buildings on the parapet of which she was poised ready to fall of men who chased her armed with long bright knives and she turned and twisted in her bed restlessly then she dreamt she had committed a murder she had murdered gordon stuart she had never heard of gordon stuart until larry had mentioned his name but she pictured him as a weak youth and now the day of doom had come she dreamt and they brought her from the cell with her hands strapped behind her and she paced slowly by the side of a white robed clergyman into a little shed and then a man an executioner had stepped out and he had the mocking face of blind jake she felt the rope about her neck and tried to scream but it was choking her choking her she woke up two hands were about her throat and in the reflected light from a street lamp outside she looked up into the sightless face of blind jake it was no dream it was reality she tried to move but he held her so that she was powerless one of his knees pressed on her and he was talking softly a sibilant whisper meant only for her ear fanny you gave me away he whispered you gave me away you devil poor old blind jake you tried to put him into jug you did i know all about it i ve got a little pal at todd s who told me and now you re going out d ye hear she was choking choking she could not articulate she felt her face going purple and the cruel hands tightening and then the light switched on and the man from manchester who had occupied the bedroom on the opposite side of the landing and who had waited throughout the night listening for the stealthy tread of blind jake knowing that he would come after he had learnt he was betrayed larry holt a long browning in his hand covered the strangler put up your hands jake he said and blind jake turned round with a low growl like the snarl of a tiger at bay chapter xv the fight in the dark for a moment they stood thus neither man moving then jake put up his hands slowly got a little gun have ye he growled you re not going to hurt a poor old man mr holt come forward steadily said larry and don t try any tricks or you ll be sorry for yourself sorry enough now mr holt grumbled the man it was wonderful to watch him he moved as lightly as a girl and his extraordinary sixth sense enabled him to avoid every obstacle which stood in his way larry was in a dilemma the man s advance toward him brought the half fainting woman on the bed in the line of fire but for that he undoubtedly intended to shoot if the man showed fight but it was impossible to fire now even to save his life without risking the life of fanny weldon and yet it would have been unfair and asking the impossible to expect the man to advance by any other way the furniture in the room being disposed as it was but the real danger to larry he never saw until it was upon him the big man came forward his hands in the air and one of them touched awkwardly the hanging electric light and then before larry knew or guessed what was happening the big man s hand closed round the bulb there was a deafening explosion as it burst under the pressure and the room was in darkness to fire now would have been madness and larry put one foot back and braced himself to meet the shock of the body which he knew was hurtling toward him and then he found himself in the hands of blind jake diana had not exaggerated his strength it was terrific and though larry was a strong man he felt himself going under what might have been the result of that struggle larry holt has never speculated upon in cold blood but there came an interruption the sound of an opening door on the landing above and a man s voice and then blind jake lifted the detective as though he had been a bundle of rags and flung him to the other end of the room where he lay gasping and breathless a second later the door had opened and blind jake was going down the carpeted stairs faster than any man with eyesight would have dared larry struggled to his feet took his flash lamp from the floor and found his revolver where it had dropped he picked it up and running to the window flung it open and peered out but blind jake had already gone round the corner somebody brought another bulb and larry went to look after the girl she was still unconscious the purple marks about her throat testifying to the character of blind jake s grip you had better get a doctor he said to the landlady who was the third person in the room and she looked at him with suspicion and distrust what were you doing in this room she asked accusingly i am going to send for a policeman send for two said larry and get a doctor fortunately the police station was near at hand and the divisional surgeon had been called to examine a doubtful case of drunkenness and he was on the spot within a few minutes by this time the woman had come back to life but had subsided into a condition of hysteria painful to witness you had better get her into an infirmary or a hospital i think doctor said holt and the surgeon agreed he was looking at the marks about her throat with a puzzled expression no man could have done this he said he must have used an instrument of some kind larry laughed it was a very rueful laugh if you think that doctor he said you d better have a look at my throat and he showed the red weal where blind jake s thumb and finger had gripped do you mean to say that he did that to you asked the doctor incredulously i do not mean to say very much about it said larry because it is not an adventure of which i am inordinately proud but he picked me up like a tennis ball and chucked me amongst the crockery ware under the window the doctor whistled by this time the landlady had been assured of larry s bona fides and was at once apologetic and tearful at the indignity which had been offered to her house by the presence even for one night of a detective officer larry went out into the street to breathe the night air he was dizzy and shaky and sore the fact that he larry holt who had pretensions to winning the middle weight amateur championship had been treated like a punch ball did not distress him what made him grave was the knowledge that there was loose in the world and in the city of london a man of the criminal classes more dangerous than a tiger with the strength of a bear and an intelligence which was little better than a monkey s and that exhausts the whole zo logical gardens said larry after he had enumerated the unpleasant qualities of his assailant half an hour afterwards every police station received an all stations message and the hunt for blind jake had begun larry reached his flat at three o clock and sunny was dozing peacefully in a chair he aroused his servant with a gentle tap sunny said he i have had the experience of a lifetime i suppose you have sir said sunny blinking himself awake will you have some coffee too sir larry was thinking thinking thinking he stood with his hands in his pockets and his legs wide apart gazing down at the hearthrug he took me by the scruff of the neck sunny he said softly and he threw me to the other side of the room he would sir said sunny what time would you like your tea in the morning weary and sick as he was larry had to laugh if i were brought home with my neck broken sunny he demanded irritably what would you do i should stop the morning papers sir said sunny without hesitation i think i should be doing right sir haven t you got a heart snarled larry no sir was the surprising reply the doctor says it s indigestion sir larry made a gesture of despair kicked off his boots slipped off his coat and vest followed that with his collar and tie and loosening his braces he lay down on the bed and pulled the eiderdown over him he did this partly because he was very tired and partly because he knew that it would annoy sunny chapter xvi mr grogan meets a lady there was a fashionable wedding on the monday at st george s hanover square a queue of motor cars and broughams stretched in all directions and lined both sides of the streets and partly filled hanover square amongst those present as they say was mr frederick grogan flash fred had not been invited for two reasons in the first place the friends of bride and bridegroom did not know him and in the second place he would not have been invited if they had but a little thing like an invitation did not worry fred he knew that when the family of the bride and the bridegroom were meeting for the first time and were regarding one another with mutual suspicion and deprecation and when all sorts of obscure cousins emerged from the oblivion which happily covered them and were not even recognizable to the principal actors in the great drama that a face such as his and a smartly tailored figure such as he possessed would pass muster and gain for him a prominent seat so he arrived at st george s in a glossy silk hat white kid gloves and perfectly pressed trousers and made his way up the aisle where he was mistaken for the bridegroom he had not come because he wished to break into society but because it was a fashion for women to wear their precious jewels in the early hours of the morning at such functions as these he had no particular piece of villainy in view he was merely surveying the land as a good general might survey a possible battlefield marriages did not interest him he regarded them as superfluous ceremonies indulged in by the idle rich and the hopeless bourgeoisie the ceremony which was long bored him to extinction and he heartily regretted having taken so prominent a place and being prevented in consequence from stealing gently out or from watching the people who were in his rear at last the service ended the organ pealed a triumphant note and the bride and bridegroom looking extremely ashamed of themselves proceeded solemnly down the aisle and fred fell in in the ranks of the near and dear and came out on to the steps he was wondering whether it would be politic or advisable to go on to the reception having discovered where that reception would be held when somebody touched his arm and he turned quickly hallo dr judd he said relieved i thought it was that fellow holt he follows me about until he s got on my nerves dr judd a fine figure of a man in his morning dress was eyeing him sternly you told me you were going to nice he said i missed the train replied fred glibly and my pal went on without me i m staying over for a few days and then i hope to get away dr judd was thoughtful walk a little way along with me he said i want to talk to you they walked without speaking a word to one another into hanover square and turned toward bond street you are getting on my nerves mr grogan said dr judd at least i thought i had the satisfaction of knowing that you were taking abnormal risks on the continent of europe instead i find you living a fashionable life in jermyn street i thought you said you didn t know i was still here asked fred quickly i said nothing of the sort replied the calm doctor i merely remarked that i thought you had said you were going to nice oh you knew i was here then said fred i had heard you were here said dr judd now mr grogan don t you think you and i should effect some sort of compromise fred was all ears in what way he asked cautiously suppose said dr judd i gave you a lump sum down on condition that you did not bother me again nothing better suited fred s plans supposing the sum were a reasonable one he would be saved the bother and anxiety of a burglary or he might even add that relaxation to swell his profits i m agreeable he said after a reasonable pause and dr judd eyed him seriously you will have to keep faith with me he said i do not intend parting with twelve thousand pounds said fred quickly yes that seems a nice tidy sum i repeat said the doctor i do not intend parting with that sum unless i have a guarantee that you will not molest me again will you dine with me at my house in chelsea to morrow night at eight o clock fred nodded there will be a few people to dinner said the doctor but nobody who knows you and i must ask as a personal favour that you will not endeavour to follow up any acquaintance you make to morrow night don t you think i am too much of a gentleman to do that sort of thing asked fred virtuously indignant i don t said the doctor shortly and parted from him at the corner of bond street twelve thousand pounds that was a most admirable arrangement and fred whose funds were getting low trod on air as he strolled down old bond street toward piccadilly in his exaltation when his generous soul had swollen and his whole mental system was experiencing the sensation of largeness he saw a girl on the opposite side of the road hers was not a face to be forgotten he had seen it once under an electric light between st martin s and the strand and he increased his pace crossing the road and following behind her not however without an anxious glance behind him for once larry holt was invisible it could not have happened better said fred for he was sensible of his fine appearance he overtook her at the corner of piccadilly and raised his hat with a smile and for a moment diana was under the impression that she knew this stranger and her hand was halfway up when he made the mistake of repeating that fashionable formula haven t you and i met before somewhere she drew her hand back my dear said fred you re the most wonderful thing in the world and i simply want to know you this too was part of the formula and had been effective on many occasions then you had better call on me she said and flash fred scarcely believed his good fortune she opened the little leather bag she carried and took out a card scribbling a number a million thanks said fred elegantly as he took the card i ll give you mine in a minute now what about a little dinner he lifted the card and read miss diana ward a beautiful name he said diana room and then his face underwent a change scotland yard he said hollowly yes i am with mr larry holt she said sweetly and fred swallowed something if he ain t here you re here and if you re not here he s here he said savagely why can t you leave a gentleman alone chapter xvii the insurance money that afternoon diana made a request of her employer which disappointed him a little certainly he said i shan t want you this evening going to a dance do you say she nodded that s fine he said heartily i hope you enjoy yourself it chilled him a little for he was so completely absorbed by the game that he could not understand that what was fun to him was work to her she must have read his thoughts for she said with a little jerk of her chin which was characteristic of her i am merely going on duty mr holt i should not have thought of going to the dance but the man who asked me is a young underwriter to whom i was secretary for about six months she said you seem to have started work at a very early age he smiled did you go to a public school i went to a council school she replied quietly my aunt who brought me up was very poor you didn t know your father and mother she shook her head i hope you re not going to associate me with the missing clarissa she smiled i am afraid my origin is a little less romantic i am always expecting to find my father figuring in the records of scotland yard if he is alive for mrs ward never spoke of him except in uncomplimentary terms yes i did begin work rather young you say you are going on duty he interrupted her what do you mean she went to her desk and took up her handbag opened it and produced a letter it will interest you to know she smiled that mr gray s wife will be there to chaperon me and joins in the invitation it did interest larry very much indeed he did not say so because he thought it might be indiscreet and he was not quite sure of how he would express the pleasure that news brought to him here is the paragraph that made me decide to go said the girl and read we have had a pretty bad time lately the loss of a ship in the baltic hit my partner rather hard and i have had to pay out a very considerable sum of money over the death of a man named stuart stuart said larry quickly that can t be our stuart by the way the jury have just returned a verdict of found drowned in that case we did not care to oppose the verdict or offer any evidence which might put the murderers on their guard stuart eh he nodded to himself several times i owe you an apology diana he said using her name for the first time i thought you were going to frivol and i was hoping that you were sufficiently interested in this case to give your whole mind to it she looked at him with kindling eyes and her face was flushed pink i am giving all my mind to it she said in a low voice it is lovely working with you and then to change the subject she told him of her adventure with fred poor old fred chuckled larry you have the satisfaction of knowing that he will avoid you like the plague for the future what time will you come back he asked why she was surprised i was wondering whether you could come here or whether i d be waiting on the door mat for you in charing cross road i want to know what you have discovered she nibbled her finger thoughtfully i will come to the yard she said i ll be here soon after eleven she looked with narrowed eyes at the mark on his throat does that feel awfully sore she asked sympathetically not so bad said larry injury to vanity doing very badly it will take some time before that heals he must be terribly strong she said with a shudder i shall never forget that night on the stairs i suppose there is no news of him none whatever said larry he s gone to ground are you watching the home the home he said in surprise no i don t think that is necessary the superintendent seems a very decent sort of man i saw the local police inspector and he told me that every man in the home is an honest character and he can vouch for all of them except the fellow they call lew he was the man i saw upstairs who seemed to be half demented i want to ask you a favour she said will you take me to morrow to the home ye es he hesitated but but will you surely if you wish to go but i don t think you ll find any clue there to bring us nearer to the gentleman who murdered stuart i wonder she said thoughtfully she permitted him to lunch with her that day it was a joyous meal for larry and he was unusually incoherent the afternoon was a more serious time for him for his search for documentary proof that diana s theory was correct and that mrs stuart had had twin daughters had been unavailing there was no record of the children s births though the files at somerset house had been diligently examined check number two said larry which will be overcome replied the girl though it is curious that a woman of mrs stuart s position should have neglected to register her children she said this and smiled and larry asked her why mrs ward had views on that subject my aunt whose name i bear she said she hated vaccination registration and education what happened to your aunt did she die asked larry the girl was silent no she didn t die she said this so strangely that larry looked at her and the girl went crimson i oughtn t to talk about her if i m not prepared to go on she said quietly i i come from a very bad stock mr holt my aunt stole from her employer and i rather think she made a practice of doing so at any rate when i was twelve she went away for quite a long time and i never saw her again larry crossed the room and laid his hand on the girl s shoulder my dear he said you have succeeded in shaking loose and establishing yourself in a truly marvellous way i am very proud of you when she looked up her eyes were filled with tears i think she drank i m not quite sure she was very good to me when i needed her most she said i would like to know what has happened to her but i simply dare not ask she went to prison the girl shook her head i think it was an inebriates home she said now what are you doing this afternoon she demanded briskly and larry laid down his programme dictated a letter or two and went out leaving her to finish them with every step he took the stuart mystery grew more and more of a tangle dead ends and culs de sac met him at every turn and even the fact that stuart had been murdered was no fact but a theory based upon the eccentricity of the tide which had left his body on the steps of the embankment and a piece of paper now stolen embossed with braille characters he stopped in his walk when he was halfway up northumberland avenue and took out his pocket book murdered dear sea he read and shook his head why the dear he wondered the man who attempted to betray the murderers would not go to the trouble of writing dear sir and anyway it occurred in the wrong place for the girl had pointed out the characters at the end of the second line dear dear dear he repeated as he strolled along and then for no reason at all a name came into his mind dearborn he laughed quietly that good soul of a clergyman labouring amongst the men who lived in everlasting darkness he shook his head again it is a fact which all people can verify that if you see an unusual name for the first time you meet with it again in the course of twenty four hours his walk carried him beyond shaftesbury avenue and in passing a theatre the name caught his eye he checked himself and stooped down to read the playbill of a theatre john dearborn he read dearborn was apparently the author of the play which was being performed here what was the theatre he stepped back in the roadway and looked up at the name in coloured glass on the edge of the awning the macready it was from the macready theatre that gordon stuart disappeared without hesitation he walked into the vestibule to the booking office and his quick eyes fell upon the plan which the office keeper had before him there were precious few blue marks indicating that seats had been taken can you tell me where i can find mr john dearborn he asked the office keeper looked at him with an air of pained resignation you re not a friend of the management s are you no admitted larry i am not you re not a friend of mr dearborn s by any chance are you asked the clerk carelessly and larry shook his head well said the man i ll speak my mind i didn t want to hurt your feelings i don t know where to find mr dearborn and i wish the management didn t know where to find him either i m leaving this week he said so it doesn t matter very much what i say he s about the rottenest playwright that the world has ever seen i m not choking you off buying a seat am i he asked good humouredly no no said larry with a smile well i won t persuade you to buy one said the box office keeper i haven t any grudge against you anyway we had six people in at the saturday matin e and we look like having three to night the only people who take any interest in this play are the commissioners in lunacy who come along and watch the audience and whenever a lunatic breaks out of hanwell they send the keepers here to search the house you haven t answered my question do you know where i can find the author of this unfortunate play the clerk shrugged his shoulders he runs a mission for something or other in the west end poor chap he s blind and maybe i oughtn t to slate him but he writes rotten plays is he continuously writing plays asked larry in surprise continuously said the other glumly i think he writes them in his sleep and they re all produced the man nodded and they re all failures again the man nodded but why surely the management would not produce successive failures from the same pen they do said the clerk in despair and that is why the macready is a byword how long has john dearborn been writing asked larry oh about ten years mind you it s not bad stuff in parts it s more mad than bad does he ever come here never said the man shaking his head i don t know why but he doesn t not even to rehearsals one more question to whom does the theatre belong to a syndicate said the clerk who was now growing restive under the questions may i ask why you re making all these inquiries i m just asking said larry with a smile and seeing that no more information could be got he went out it was rather an amazing situation he thought but to connect that one word dear with the author of bad plays or give to mr dearborn an obvious philanthropist any evil significance was absurd he was outside the theatre when he suddenly remembered and went back as a great personal favour he said could i see the house the clerk demurred at first but eventually summoned an attendant you ll find it pretty dark he said the house lights are not on larry followed the attendant into the dress circle and surveyed the little theatre it was in gloom the curtain was down and the seats were sheeted in holland which is box a asked larry for that was what he came to see the man led him along a passage through a heavy curtain and down a narrower passage which ran at the back of the boxes and at the end he stopped and opened a door on his right larry stepped in the box was in darkness and he lit a match there was nothing peculiar about box a except that the carpet on the floor was thick and rich and the three chairs which formed its furniture were beautifully designed are all the boxes furnished like this asked larry no sir said the man only box a larry came out and examined the passage opposite the door of box a a thick red curtain was draped on the wall he drew it aside and found an iron door on which in red letters were the words exit in case of fire where does this lead to he asked to a side street sir said the man to cowley street it is not really a street but a passage which is the property of this theatre and is blocked up at one end larry tipped the man and went out he was nearer to the solution of gordon stuart s disappearance and murder at that moment than he had ever been before and he knew it he was in his office at half past ten that night waiting impatiently for the arrival of the girl and endeavouring by self analysis to discover whether his eagerness to see her was due to his professional zeal or to his personal interest in the girl herself she came at ten minutes to eleven and he who had never seen her before save in her working dress was stricken dumb at the sight of this radiant beauty he could not know that the black tulle dress she wore cost her something less than or that the bandeau of black leaves about her golden hair cost something short of ten shillings to him she was magnificently arrayed and a creature so divine and ethereal that he hardly dared speak to her come in he said you re making the furniture look shabby she laughed dropped her cloak on her chair and larry forgot the official and important side of her visit and would have continued in oblivion if she had not brought him to earth with a triumphant i ve got it got it he stammered oh yes you saw your underwriting friend she opened a little satin bag and took out a piece of paper i ve made some notes she said my friend was very hard hit by stuart s death and it is this stuart larry whistled how did it happen he asked my friend is an underwriter he s in the insurance business she explained when a man has his life insured for a very large sum as you probably know the company that issues the policy does not retain all the risk it sends round to other offices and to various underwriters offering each underwriter some of the responsibility it appears that my friend the underwriter underwrote three thousand pounds worth of the reinsurance three thousand pounds worth said larry in astonishment then in the name of heaven for how much was stuart insured i asked that she nodded and lifted her paper on the policy which was endorsed by mr gray the sum of was mentioned but mr gray says that there was another policy for a similar amount larry sat down his eyes gleaming so that was the business end of stuart s death was it insured for did your friend pay naturally he paid said the girl the moment the company which had accepted the insurance had sent in its claim he had nothing else to do but to find the money what is the name of the company she paused and looked at him the greenwich insurance company she replied slowly and he jumped to his feet dr judd he said softly chapter xviii at the pawnbroker s he escorted the girl downstairs and they stood talking in the hall there was a car at the door a luxury which she easily explained she was using the grays car which was to go back and pick up the underwriter and his wife at two o clock i hate declining your invitation said larry but i am hanging on to the end of a wire i sent harvey on a tour of investigation to day and he promised to phone me round about midnight she was looking at him in some concern aren t you rather overdoing it she said you don t get any sleep he laughed i am one of those fortunate people who can do without sleep he said boastfully and then an official came out of one of the ground floor rooms there is a call through for you sir he said come along said larry i may get this business off and then i shall be able to revel in that millionaire feeling he went back to his room and the girl followed it was not sergeant harvey who had called him but the inspector in charge of the oxford lane police station is that inspector holt he asked that s me said larry ungrammatically you circulated a description of a sleeve link of black enamel and diamonds yes said larry quickly well said the man mr emden of emden and smith pawnbrokers brought a pair of links exactly tallying with the description published in the hue and cry have you got them there asked larry eagerly no sir said the inspector but mr emden is here if you would like to interview him he can get the links in the morning he happened to be reading the hue and cry to night after dinner and he came upon the description and immediately walked over to the station he lives close by i ll come down said larry what is it asked the girl have they found the links larry shook his head they ve found a pair of links exactly like the one which was found in gordon stuart s hand he said a little puzzled i can t understand that if it had been half a link or a link and a half that would have been clearly a clue he looked dubiously at the switchboard and the operator if sergeant harvey comes through he said tell him to ring me again or if he is in reach of the office to come back and wait for me i am going to the oxford lane police station incidentally he said to the girl as they came out i will accept a lift in your palatial conveyance he dropped her at her flat there was a lounger outside who saluted larry you are not putting a guard on me said the girl in surprise i think that s unnecessary mr holt my own experience tells me that it is very necessary said larry grimly the gentleman who tossed me about as though i were a feather is not wanting in courage there is no other way into the house except by this front door is there he asked the detective on duty no sir i have had a good look round and i ve also been into the lady s rooms she gasped how she asked i had a duplicate key made from yours said larry i hope you don t mind and talking of keys he added the appearance of blind jake in fanny weldon s room is now no mystery at all she had given him a key of the house in case she missed him with the swag on saturday night he was to come up and take it from her she was in such terror of him that she did not dare refuse the key but she must have forgotten she had loaned it for she would never have slept he said good night to her and went on to oxford lane on foot mr emden proved to be a mild little man in pince nez i happened to be running through the list of properties stolen he said and i came upon this description of yours mr holt he showed a fold of the paper on which a drawing of the link whose fellow was sought appeared you say you have a pair yes sir said the man it was pledged with me this morning as a matter of fact it happened to be me who took the pledge i don t as a rule work behind the counter but one of my clerks had gone on a message and when the man came in i took the links and gave the pledger for them they are not of a usual pattern are they asked larry and mr emden shook his head they are very unusual he said i don t remember having seen a pair exactly like those before i think they must be of a french make they were slightly damaged three of the diamonds on the rim were missing or i should have given him a great deal more do you know the man who pledged them no sir he was a smart looking fellow who told me he d got tired of them my impression was he hesitated well said larry well i thought in spite of his good appearance that he looked like one of these smart thieves that abound in the west end and i had an idea that he was pledging them not so much because he wanted the money but because he wanted to put them in a safe place a thief will often do that and take the chance of the pawnbroker discovering that the property is missing or wanted by the police larry nodded smartly dressed he said thoughtfully and then quickly did he wear any diamonds yes sir said the pawnbroker that is why i thought he was planting the stuff four pounds isn t much to advance on property of that value but he didn t make any fuss what name asked larry he gave the name of mr frederick and i think an accommodation address flash fred said larry is jermyn street in your district he asked the inspector yes sir said the officer send a couple of men out and pull in flash fred bring him here first and afterwards if it is necessary i ll take him to cannon row is it an arrest asked the inspector a detention merely he may be able to explain but i think he ll have to be clever if he gets out of this now mr emden he said turning to the pawnbroker i m afraid i can t wait until the morning and i must ask you to accompany me to your shop and let me have the actual links with pleasure sir said the pawnbroker i expected something like that and i brought my keys over my shop is only about five minutes walk away accompanied by a plain clothes officer they went to the shop and mr emden fitted the key in the side door but as he pressed the key into the keyhole the door gave why the door s open he said in surprise and went quickly down the side passage he tried another door but there was no need even to go through the formality of putting a key in the lock the door was ajar and larry s pocket lamp revealed the mark of the jemmy that had opened it the pawnbroker hurried into his main premises and switched on the light a book lay on the counter open at the page of that day s transactions where did you put these links asked larry quickly in the safe in my private office said the man look he returned to the book there is the number also the word safe said larry and somehow i don t think you ll see your safe intact and his words proved prophetic the big burglar proof safe presented a somewhat untidy appearance for a hole had been burnt in the steel and the lock had disappeared articles of value there were none every package had been cleared out i think they have got those links said larry grimly chapter xix in flash fred s flat after the discovery in the pawnbroker s shop larry went back to the police station to make yet another discovery flash fred was not in his lodgings i wish you would come down and see his flat sir said the officer who had gone to make the arrest i think that something queer has happened if there has been anything in this case which has not been queer said larry with asperity i should like to hear about it flash fred lived in modley house jermyn street a block of service flats and the porter had a strange story to tell mr grogan came in at about eleven o clock to night he said and went up to his flat i took him a syphon of soda he ordered and said good night to him afterwards i went round seeing that the service doors were shut and that the lights had been out in the kitchen then came to my cubby hole to have my supper and read the evening newspaper the cubby hole was a space under the stairway which had been converted into a little office where the tenants left their keys at about half past twelve i thought i heard a sound like a shot and a man s voice shout something and i came out into the passage and listened there was still a sort of disturbance going on so i went up to the second floor where the sound came from and listened again there was a light in mr grogan s flat i could see that through the transom it was the only light visible i knocked at the door and after a while mr grogan came to the door and i tell you he was a most terrifying sight he had a big knife in his hand and his clothes were smothered with blood oh it s you is it he said come in i went into the sitting room and a pretty sight it was chairs thrown over the table upside down and glasses and bottles scattered over the floor outside mr grogan s window are the stairs of the fire escape and the window was open what s wrong sir i asked nothing particular he said only a burglar broke in that s all give me a whisky and soda he was trembling from head to foot and was very excited he kept muttering to himself but i didn t hear what he said when i came back with the whisky and soda he had cleaned the knife and was more calm i found him standing at the open window looking down into the yard where the fire escape leads and then i noticed that one of the pictures hanging on the wall was smashed by a bullet i knew it was a bullet because i was in the metropolitan police for some years and i ve seen a similar mark i told him there would be serious trouble over this disturbance because the other tenants would complain but he asked me not to worry about that and gave me to pay his rent and any expenses that we had been put to and asked me to keep the flat until he returned he said he was going abroad what happened then asked larry when the man paused well sir he came out with a bag got into a cab and drove off and that s the last i saw of him larry made an examination of the room and he found that the porter s description had been a faithful one the room was illuminated by a cluster of three lights hanging from the ceiling and covered by a shade one of the globes was smashed and larry drew the attention of the porter to this yes sir these lights work on two circuits one switch turns on one and the other switch turns on two as a rule mr grogan only has the single light on larry nodded i pretty well know what happened he said he could picture the scene in the room the intruder coming through the window flash fred covering him with his revolver and the big man advancing with upraised hands until he could reach the globe and crush it in his powerful paw and then fred had fired and the man was on him but fred was too slippery fred had been cleverer than he these continental crooks who take enormous risks do not depend so much upon their guns as upon their knives and to blind jake s surprise for blind jake it must have been grogan had met the onrush and the suffocating hug of this animal man with a steel blade and releasing his hold blind jake must have made his escape through the open window but where was fred in that moment larry felt an unexpected wave of sympathy for the crook he too then had stumbled by accident or design upon the murderer of gordon stuart what was that clue he must find flash fred and find him at once for this thief might have in his hands a solution to the mystery he went home phoned to headquarters and discovered that harvey had made a negative report took a bath and went to bed he slept for four hours and then by his instructions sunny who seemed equally able to dispense with the recuperation of sleep brought him his tea and toast what time is it asked larry blinking himself awake nine o clock sir said sunny the postman has come and the papers have been bring me my letters said larry jumping out of bed he looked them through as he sipped his tea one had come evidently delivered by hand for there was no stamp upon the envelope when did this arrive he asked the valet when sunny returned to the room it was in the box when i got up sir said sunny i think it must have come by hand you re a fool sunny snapped larry of course it came by hand i m glad you agree with me sir said the imperturbable sunny larry ripped open the envelope and took out a sheet of paper it began without any polite preliminary you had better interest yourself in another case mr holt you will get into serious trouble if you do not heed this warning oh yes said larry and rang the bell sunny he said bring me my coat and the papers that are in the inside pocket larry searched for and found the letter which flash fred had received inviting him to call at todd s home at six o clock in the morning and to avoid attracting attention he put the letter of warning by its side and compared them they were in the same handwriting chapter xx the woman who drew the insurance money diana ward i m a greatly rattled man said larry the girl stopped working her fingers poised above the keys of her typewriter then she swung round in her chair the case is growing a little clearer to me she said quietly i wish to heaven it would grow clearer to me grumbled larry here is the situation let me recapitulate he ticked off the points on the fingers of one hand as he leant back in his chair a rich canadian who comes to london apparently to visit the grave of his deserted wife and child is murdered after seeing a play at the macready theatre the author of that play is john dearborn who admittedly writes the worst trash that has ever been seen on the stage but that doesn t make him a murderer and moreover he is a respectable clergyman engaged in a great humanitarian work amongst the blind the murdered stuart leaves written on the inside of his shirt front a will leaving the whole of his property to a daughter who apparently has no existence so far as we can discover certain clues are found one a piece of braille writing another a black enamel and diamond sleeve link which is found in the dead man s hand the braille writing is stolen from scotland yard the sleeve links when they fall into the possession of flash fred and are pawned by him for security are regarded by some person or persons unknown as being of such importance that a burglary is committed at the pawnbroker s shop in which they are pledged with no other object i should imagine than to recover those links moreover the agent of the enemy proceeds first to attempt your abduction then the murder of fanny weldon who committed the burglary at scotland yard which is understandable and then the destruction of flash fred which is also within my understanding as a matter of fact the only inexplicable point in the whole case he said with a smile is their attempt to strafe you she nodded that is a mystery to me too she confessed we have now discovered said larry ticking off the point on another finger that stuart was heavily insured at the office of dr judd of the greenwich insurance company dr judd makes no secret of the fact that this insurance was effected have you seen dr judd she asked in surprise i have telephoned to him he said and i am seeing him this morning perhaps you will come along with me we can postpone our visit to the home until this afternoon he saw her face brighten up you like to be in this game don t you he bantered her i think it s wonderfully fascinating she replied and i like to be close to things i had a feeling yesterday that you thought i wasn t keen larry blushed guiltily it was only for a second he admitted and it was very unworthy and after all why should you elect to work all the hours that heaven sends because i want to see the murderer of gordon stuart brought to justice she answered steadily and larry experienced a little thrill dr judd expected one visitor and was to all appearances surprised agreeably when larry s companion came into the big managing director s office on bloomsbury pavement this is dr judd my secretary miss ward introduced larry miss ward has a very excellent memory and it may be necessary for me to have a shorthand note of our talk i should prefer that said dr judd yet he seemed ill at ease at the presence of the girl if larry noticed this fact it did not alter his plans i am glad you have come said dr judd slowly i wanted to talk to you about the man with whom you saw me the first time we met i am afraid that you received an altogether wrong impression though as to this i cannot blame you for the man is a disreputable scoundrel have you seen him lately i have neither seen nor heard of him for weeks said larry untruthfully and the girl found that she had to exercise all her self control to prevent her looking up in surprise well said the doctor we can talk about that at some other time do you mind my smoking miss ward she shook her head with a smile i am an inveterate smoker of cigarettes said the doctor i have smoked a hundred a day for twenty five years and my robust health gives the lie to all the anti tobacconists he laughed and he had a very hearty and pleasant laugh it was a gurgle of genuine merriment which was so infectious that diana found herself smiling in sympathy the doctor lit a cigarette then took a folder from his desk and opened it here are the policies he said you will notice that they are made payable to a nominee who shall be afterwards named that authorization came to us on the day of stuart s death i will show it to you presently the matter was not brought to my attention until yesterday morning when my clerk reminded me that we had issued these policies simultaneously we received a demand for the money accompanied by a certificate of death or rather a copy of the certificate issued by the coroner which can be obtained for about five shillings said larry and dr judd inclined his head it was sufficient he said quietly and at any rate when the legatees called there was no reason in the world why i should not pay the money and that payment was made how was it paid by cash or cheque by open cheque at the lady s request at the lady s said larry and diana together for she had been surprised into this ejaculation dr judd looked at her with a little smile and rubbed his hands gleefully i like a secretary who takes a keen interest in affairs he chuckled but who was the lady asked larry the doctor took two slips of paper from the folder and laid one before the detective here is the receipt he said you see it is for one hundred thousand pounds larry took up the paper and examined it it was signed clarissa stuart chapter xxi when diana fainted larry could not believe his eyes he handed the slip to the girl but she had already seen the signature over his shoulder clarissa stuart he said slowly do you know her never heard of her before said the doctor cheerfully but she was the person nominated to receive the proceeds of the policy what is she like asked larry after a pause dr judd was lighting a fresh cigarette from the glowing end of another and he threw the butt into the fireplace before he replied young pretty fashionably dressed he said briefly did she seem distressed at all not at all said the doctor on the contrary she was rather amusing they looked at one another diana ward and larry holt and there was blank astonishment in each pair of eyes did this lady give any address no it was not necessary said the doctor i told you i gave her an open cheque well she seemed a little perturbed at first she did not want a cheque so i sent my clerk to the bank to draw the money and when he brought it back i delivered it to her so it was in cash said larry literally it was in cash i paid her said dr judd you have never seen her before persisted larry dr judd shook his head she came from nowhere so far as i am concerned he said she was undoubtedly the daughter of mr stuart or at least she told me so and i have no reason to disbelieve her word larry and the girl were out in the street again before he spoke to the girl it is amazing he said his cab was waiting and he ushered the girl in no nottingham place he said where are we going asked the girl in surprise we re going to the lodgings that stuart had replied larry i left the investigation at that point to sergeant harvey and he is a particularly thorough man but may have missed something surely if gordon stuart learnt on the day of his death that he had another daughter he must have had some visitor do you think the girl saw him asked diana quickly clarissa i mean it is possible replied larry but that is to be discovered no nottingham place was a big and sedate looking mansion of the type which is patronized by american visitors of the better class and larry and his companion were shown into a comfortable drawing room a few minutes after a little lady with white hair came in mrs portland isn t it said larry my name is holt i am from scotland yard a look of dismay came to the lady s face oh dear she said evidently distressed i did hope that the police had finished with me it gets this house such a bad name and i ve already suffered in consequence the poor gentleman committed suicide didn t he why he should i don t know she said shaking her head i have never seen him so cheerful as he was the night just before he went to the theatre as a rule he was so glum and sad that it depressed me to see him cheerful before he went to the theatre said larry quickly unusually so she nodded had he any visitors in the afternoon none sir replied the lady and larry s face dropped none at all i told your detective officer who called that he never received visitors he had been out in the afternoon and i must confess that he came back a little before we expected him we had a charwoman in and she was making his room tidy and the first i knew about his room was when i passed his door and i heard him having a long conversation with somebody it was so unusual that i spoke to my head waitress about it who was the somebody asked larry and the landlady smiled it was the charwoman she said a woman i used to get in to do odd jobs i thought it was extraordinary because he never spoke to anybody how long was the woman with him asked larry nearly an hour was the surprising reply an hour said larry he was talking with a charwoman for an hour what did he talk about she shook her head i don t know i remember it well because the charwoman left without drawing her wages in fact she must have gone straight out after leaving mr stuart s room and she never came back larry frowned that is important he said did you tell sergeant harvey no sir said the lady in surprise i didn t think it was worth while reporting a little domestic incident like that he asked me if mr stuart had had any visitors and i replied truthfully that he had not what was the woman s name i don t know said the landlady we used to call her emma i am surprised she didn t come back because she left her wedding ring here she used to take it off before she started scrubbing it is a peculiar ring for a woman of her position half platinum and half gold and catch that young lady sir she said suddenly larry turned quickly and caught the girl as she fainted chapter xxii the man who was deaf he carried her to a sofa and laid her down and presently she opened her eyes i am an awful idiot she said trying to rise but he laid his hand on her shoulder you must lie there a little while what is the trouble the room is a little close i think she said the room was stuffy larry had noticed it when he came in and as the landlady pulled up the window she apologized i m always telling the servants to keep this room aired and they never do she said it s like a furnace i am very sorry larry had seen many fainting women but never before had such a phenomenon occasioned him so much alarm i don t remember doing such a stupid thing before said the girl at last sitting up you had better go home said larry solemnly she was still very white but the cup of tea which the landlady brought in revived her i m not going home she said firmly i am going with you to todd s you promised me i should and as soon as i get into the air i shall be all right if you were to take me a drive around regent s park it s quite near i should be as well as ever they made the slow round of the outer circle and the colour came back to her face was it this morning you told me i was overdoing it smiled larry my young friend you are in danger of a breakdown she shook her head i shall be very hurt if you insist upon that i am not so stupid that i would go on if i wasn t fit she said that undignified collapse into your arms will not occur again besides she said mischievously if i am liable to having a fit on the mat don t you think it would be better if you were with me than if i were by myself in my room there s something in that said larry but i m not so sure that visiting todd s is the best way of spending an afternoon it s very smelly and the sights are not quite pleasant they will not worry me she answered quietly please please let me go he reached over and took her hand and she did not resist this attention you can go just where you like diana he said and and as far as you like by now his own flustered feelings had calmed and he remembered that he had not asked to see the novel wedding ring of emma the charwoman nor had he made the inquiries which he would have made but for the dramatic interruption of diana s collapse he drove the girl back to piccadilly and they lunched together and then they went on to scotland yard in the restaurant he had telephoned to harvey and harvey had renewed the distress of mrs portland by another visit he was waiting for larry at the yard in room when they returned i ve traced emma he said and his tone was so serious that larry knew that he was not wrong in giving importance to the interview which the charwoman had with stuart she lives or lived in camden town said harvey she lodges with an army pensioner and his wife well have you seen her no sir i haven t seen her she s no longer there said harvey she has not been home since the night following the stuart murder larry made a little grimace that is the real end and the real clue of this crime he said emma the charwoman is going to supply us with a considerable amount of information did she take away her things from her lodgings he asked no sir replied harvey that is the curious circumstance the woman neither told her friends that she was leaving nor did she take any of her clothing or her belongings with her put her on the list said larry and warn all stations no news of blind jake no sir nor fred no sir to the already overburdened vigilance of the metropolitan constabulary poor chaps said larry with a smile we will add the name of miss clarissa stuart young pretty and smartly dressed probably staying in a good class hotel put a comb through those places where a woman of wealth is likely to be and report harvey lifted his hat and went out and larry walked slowly to his desk and stood for a while looking down at it disapprovingly i don t know why i am given a table in this office he said i never sit at it nevertheless he dropped down in his chair and glanced across at the girl well miss ward he said you have a further mystery to add to the others emma has disappeared as unexpectedly as flash fred or as stuart and the man who persuaded emma to go was the man who nearly persuaded mrs weldon to depart this life blind jake she asked that is the lad he replied a terrible figure i can t think of him without a shudder what a confession for a detective to make she scoffed of course you can think of him he s human and a very sore human too smiled larry for flash fred was fairly useful with a knife in the days when i was trailing him for carving up leroux a rival of his do you think they have caught him she asked he shook his head no fred has gone to earth he s gone because he s afraid they ll catch him then he is not in with them fred he laughed not fred fred s a lone wolf and plays a lone hand he preys upon the virtuous and the wicked alike one of his many boasts is that he has never been a member of a gang and i dare say that is why he has so far escaped or partially escaped the consequence of his rascality he is in london he mused and i have an idea we shall see him again very soon how soon he could not guess he worked for an hour and seemed oblivious both of diana s presence and the looks she shot across at him glances which were intended to remind him that he was taking her to todd s he covered sheet after sheet of paper for it was his practice to write down his cases in narrative form dovetailing the cause to the effect they were curious looking documents these statements of his abounding in marginal notes and interlinear corrections presently he finished writing dropping the last sheet and slipping the paper into a drawer then he got up and stretched himself he walked to the window and looked out it was late afternoon and he could glimpse a wonderful picture of the thames embankment a vista of blue bridges spanning a leaden stream of dim spires looming through the eastern haze of a long line of green where the trees shaded the broad sidewalk of chocolate coloured tram cars that flashed to and fro a fragment of london recognizable even to those who had never seen the great city or throbbed to its ceaseless pulsations larry holt scratched his nose unromantically and turned a dubious look to the waiting girl if you still want to go to todd s i ll take you he said this is the hour i d promised myself the pleasure of a visit a car took them to the end of lissom grove and they walked down lissom lane which was a cul de sac opening from the bigger thoroughfare two plain clothes police officers who were waiting joined them and the party stepped to the side of the street opposite that on which the home was situated what is the place next door asked larry nodding at a black looking house with shuttered windows it used to be a laundry said the policeman there s a yard and a shed at the back laundry said the girl thoughtfully do you remember that it was a laundry van that was outside my flat that night they tried to carry me off by jimmy said larry so it was it couldn t have been this laundry miss said the policeman it has not been doing business for twelve months they went bankrupt and somebody bought up the business but doesn t seem to have made a start yet those gates lead to the yard i presume said larry pointing yes sir i haven t seen a motor van come out of there and i don t even know that they have one said the policeman but nowadays when there are so many motor vehicles about it is impossible to keep track of them larry went up the steps and knocked at the door and the same little old man opened four people he yelled all strangers what do you want i want to see mr dearborn said larry oh yes sir you are the gentleman that came on sunday morning at six a m said the little man and went pattering down the long passage come this way he bawled all of you four of them sir the rev john dearborn came out of his study to meet the party and ushered them in mr holt i think i recognized your voice he said his little dictating machine was spinning and there was a thick pad of typed manuscript on his table he put his hand lovingly upon it as he passed to his chair i have a gentleman who comes in to read for me in the evening he said as though guessing larry s thoughts now what is the object of to night s visit he asked have you found your blind jake i have met him without finding him replied larry grimly i merely want to see over the house i have brought a lady with me how interesting said the rev john dearborn rising the girl held out her hand instinctively and the man took it i shall be most happy to show you round you have some other friends larry introduced them and together they went up the stairs john dearborn leading the way we will start at the top of the house this time he said humorously our friend lew is still in his cubicle aren t you afraid to keep a man here who is not quite right in his head he is very weak said john dearborn and i haven t the heart to send him to the infirmary i fear that i must do so sooner or later larry had the girl by his side on the landing and lowering his voice he asked do you want to see this old man he is rather he did not finish his sentence i want to see him yes she said you forget that i was nurse in an institute for the blind dearborn led the way to the cubicle no lights shone though there were electric globes on every landing the blind needed no lights thought larry the old man in the cubicle lay quietly on his back his hands folded patiently he was no longer talking and was indeed much calmer than when larry had seen him last how are you to day asked larry the man made no reply it was the girl who laid her hand upon his shoulder are you feeling better she asked and the man started round who s that is that you jim he asked have you got any supper are you feeling better said diana and bring me a mug of tea will you said lew and lay over on his back and resumed the same attitude of resignation in which they had found him the girl stooped and looked closely at the old man and sensing her presence he put up his hand and touched her face is that a lady he said and then dearborn pressed past them and caught the man s hand in his are you better to day lew he said and the man winked all right sir he replied i m feeling fine thank you diana ward walked out of the cubicle her eyes fixed absently on space and larry joined her what is the matter he asked that man is dead she said dead he repeated in amazement of course he s not dead she nodded her head diana i don t understand you said larry he thought for a moment that her fainting fit had affected her mind and that she was talking light headedly dead she repeated and her voice had a passionate thrill which made him gasp as effectively dead as if he were lying cold and lifeless on that bed oh it s cruel cruel john dearborn and the detectives were still in the cubicle discussing the invalid what do you mean diana he asked don t you see i ve seen it happen once before she said in a low voice that shook there were little black marks on the man s ear those are powder marks he has been deafened deafened he whispered still not grasping the significance of the revelation you told me something of what this man said when you saw him on sunday she said speaking rapidly and almost in a whisper and now i see what has happened this man has had a shotgun discharged near both ears and he is dead but i don t understand do you realize she asked and she spoke slowly now what it means to be blind and deaf good god he gasped that is what has happened to the man they call lew some persons who for their own purpose desire to spare his life have made him incapable of testifying against them what do you mean i mean she said that he is the man who wrote the braille message found in gordon stuart s pocket chapter xxiii the disappearance of diana ward was it guesswork was it sheer deduction was it knowledge these three questions flashed through larry s mind but before he could ask her any further questions john dearborn had come from the cubicle and was feeling his way down the stairs on the next landing he opened the door of a dormitory which larry had seen before it consisted of three rooms which had been knocked into one at some previous period obedient to larry s instructions the two detectives did not follow the party in one strolled down and took his place on the lower landing the other sat upon the stairs that led to the cubicles above and waited is it light asked dearborn as he walked into the inner room quite light said larry i am told there is rather a good view from this window said dearborn and pointed unerringly to a view which was neither picturesque nor extensive larry did not reply it was possibly a polite fiction that the views from the home were lovely and he did not desire to hurt even in the slightest degree the man who was so proud of a prospect which included six roofs and a hundred chimney pots is the window closed i think it is said john dearborn will you open it for me larry pulled up the noisy sash and a breath of cool sweet air came into the stuffy dormitory thank you said mr dearborn now perhaps the young lady larry was looking about the room the girl was not in sight he walked quickly to the door and the officer on duty stood up from the stairs on which he had been sitting which way did miss ward go she didn t come out sir said the man in surprise she went in the room with you larry stared at him didn t come out he repeated in amazement are you sure absolutely sure he called to the man on the lower landing did you see miss ward no sir said the officer she hasn t come out of that door i can see it plainly from here and i haven t taken my eyes off it larry went back into the room it was empty there were half a dozen plain iron beds but there was no place of concealment save a cupboard which stood against the wall opposite the fireplace he was in a panic and his heart was beating wildly as no danger to himself could have made it beat he pulled open the cupboard door it was empty except for some old clothing which was hanging on a line of pegs he flung these out and struck the back of the cupboard it was solid have you found the young lady asked dearborn presently no i have not said larry quickly is there any other way out of this room but these doors the clergyman shook his head no he said in astonishment why do you ask oh perhaps you are thinking we should have a means of egress in case of fire we have been thinking over that matter larry was white of face and he was trembling he called in one of the police officers you will remain in this room until you are relieved he said then he summoned the other call scotland yard in my name and tell them i want twenty plain clothes men here at once there s a constable on point duty at the end of lissom grove bring him here and station him outside the house what has happened demanded the rev dearborn anxiously these are the only times when my malady distresses me when i feel that i cannot help perhaps it would be better if you went to your study said larry gently i am afraid a crime has been committed under my very eyes how could it have happened he had heard no sound he thought the girl was behind him he knew she had gone into the room because he had pushed her in before him he remembered that distinctly he remembered her turning to the left to inspect the lower end of the room when he had gone to open the window that was when it happened when he had pulled up the window he had made a noise which had drowned any sound which may have occurred at the farther end of the room but it had all passed so quickly and she had not left the room he began a systematic examination of the walls looking for secret doorways the coconut matting on the floor was pulled up but without result diana ward had disappeared as though an earthquake had swallowed her as though she had dissolved into minutest atoms and had floated out of the window in invisible vapour chapter xxiv the laundry yard larry paced the dormitory sick with fear terrified as he had never been before he had searched the house from roof to cellar had explored dusty and dark corners of which the occupants of todd s home were unacquainted but searchings and questionings produced nothing nothing within half an hour a cordon of plain clothes men had been drawn round the house and larry had been relieved from the dormitory and set free to conduct his search elsewhere there is no communication between this house and the next he had asked the clergyman none whatever said john dearborn without hesitation in fact some years ago the noise from the laundry was so great and disturbing to my men that i compelled the proprietors of the building to put up a new wall a sort of inner lining to deaden the sound it is no longer in the occupation of the company he said they went bankrupt and the premises were taken over by a firm of provision merchants i understand that they intended storing their goods in the laundry building that is the small building one can see over the gates at the end of the yard said larry that is so replied the superintendent larry went up to the door of the empty house and examined it carefully and a sergeant from scotland yard made a close inspection i can tell you this sir that nobody has been in or out of this door for a very long time he said over the railings which enclosed a narrow area they could see through the dusty windows into a room which was the quintessence of dinginess it was quite bare and innocent of furniture larry felt his heart sinking with every minute that passed if he should lose her if he should lose her only then did he realize what this girl meant to him she was a friend of less than a week and yet all other matters and interests friends profession success none of these meant anything to him compared with that one slim girl he would willingly have sacrificed every prospect he had in life to hold her hand once more or to exchange with her a dozen words in the power of blind jake he reeled under the thought it was maddening grotesquely horrible he pulled himself together with a jerk he would go mad if he allowed his mind to dwell upon that hideous possibility he had no time to think upon the stuart case or its bearing on this disappearance all his energy and agony of endeavour were concentrated upon one object one discovery diana ward he climbed over the wooden gates and explored the yard of the laundry and here he found something which set his eyes on the trail again there were wheel tracks and they were comparatively new the tracks of a motor car possibly two cars he looked round the littered yard for a garage and saw a black looking door which had the appearance of closing some such building sergeant harvey who had followed him over the gate tried a pick lock on the door and after two attempts succeeded in forcing back the bolt of the lock the doors were fixed on slides and they went back easily and noiselessly almost at a touch they have been used recently said larry there were two cars in the garage a long bonneted limousine and a small motor van larry walked in and there was light enough to see for the day had not yet failed look cried larry suddenly pointing to the hood of the motor van it had been newly painted but clearly underneath the white paint which covered it was the faint impression of a word badly and awkwardly painted by an amateur hand the word laundry do you remember harvey miss ward telling us that there was a laundry van outside her flat the night they tried to abduct her if she can identify this he stopped suddenly with a twinge of pain if she were there to identify anything the limousine had recently been cleaned and he took the precaution of jotting down the numbers of both cars it might be of course that these machines were the legitimate property of the new owners of the building and had been engaged only in perfectly innocent business it might have been a coincidence that such a car was waiting in the charing cross road the night blind jake tried to abduct the girl he closed the doors and harvey re locked them phone these numbers through to the yard said larry ask the registration department to identify them harvey went off and larry was left alone in the yard he went again to the wheel tracks they had been made that morning for a shower of rain had fallen in the night and the newness of the markings was obvious he walked along to the laundry building proper a new erection of brick with ground glass windows here too was a sliding door and on the stone steps leading up was a foot mark he bent suddenly to look at the print larry in moments of excitement was wont to act jerkily and now his movements to an observer would seem sudden and unexpected as he bent his head plok it was a sound like a cork being discharged from a gaseous champagne bottle only a little louder a little more metallic there was an answering crash near at hand a splinter of wood fell upon larry s neck and he jumped up with a start a panel of the door was smashed as by a bullet if he had not dropped his head at that moment to examine the footprint sunny would have stopped the morning papers that strangely enough was the first thought that struck him larry looked round quickly he had recognized the sound as soon as he had heard it there had been no report but he had been fired at with a rifle or pistol fitted with a maxim silencer he had heard that plok before his keen eyes ranged the windows of the building behind for a sign of smoke but whatever there might have been must have been instantly dissipated then he noticed for the first time that the dormitory from whence the girl had disappeared commanded a view of the yard he saw the open window and with his exact sense of topography located the room no other shot was fired and he crossed the yard keeping his eyes upon the backs of the two houses ready to drop at the first flash of a rifle harvey on his way back had opened a wicket in the bigger gate and larry stepped out into the street in a thoughtful frame of mind he went straight back to the home the blind hawkers who used the home were beginning to arrive they came in ones and twos tapping their way with their iron shod sticks and as they passed him on their way to the common room a local officer identified them they re all decent citizens eh said larry none of them is on the crime index none sir said the man they re all quite law abiding people and we ve never had a complaint against any of them larry went up to the dormitory from whence he believed the shot had been fired to his surprise the door was locked and the officer was on duty outside what is the meaning of this he asked sternly the superintendent sent a message up telling me that you wished to see me sir said the detective i went down and found that he had sent no such message when i came back the door was locked from the inside asked larry apparently sir there is no key in the lock who brought the message the little fellow who opens the door of the place i know him nodded larry what explanation did he give he said that somebody with the superintendent s voice told him to go upstairs with the message stand on one side said larry and with his foot kicked open the door the room was empty but he sniffed a rifle has been fired in here probably when you were downstairs he said you understand that you are not to leave this room unless i personally or sergeant harvey come to you and bring a man to take your place very good sir said the crestfallen worker but in the circumstances i m not blaming you interrupted larry with a faint smile we are dealing with an extraordinary gang and they will use extraordinary methods you cannot be expected to meet every move as it comes let alone anticipate what their next will be there was no doubt that the rifle had been fired in this room he could smell the exploded cordite the proof came when he found under the bed near the window the exploded shell of a cartridge he descended to the superintendent s office and found the rev john dearborn a little perturbed how long do you intend keeping your men here mr holt he asked some of my fellows want to go to their dormitory to sleep i am keeping my men here until i get some proof that miss ward is not on the premises said larry shortly and until i have found the gentleman who shot at me from the very dormitory in which she disappeared shot at you said the other in surprise you don t mean i mean just what i say said larry forgive me if i am brusque whilst you were talking to the detective who had been brought downstairs by a ruse i was shot at from that room and the door was locked it is most amazing said the rev john shaking his head i cannot imagine a situation more trying to myself or more exciting for you exciting repeated larry and laughed bitterly there will be excitement all right he said grimly but it will come later when i have unravelled this tangle and then his mordant humour asserted itself you should put this situation into one of your plays mr dearborn he said and he thought he saw the colour come to the man s pale face that is quite an idea replied the superintendent thoughtfully and i thank you for it have you ever seen any of my plays no i have not seen them said larry but i am going at the first opportunity to pay a visit to the macready the superintendent shook his head i sometimes fear he said that they are not as good as some of my friends think they are and i am disappointed that you have not seen one but they go on producing them and money comes in for the home who pays the cost of production asked larry curiously he welcomed any diversion from the overwhelming misery of his thoughts a gentleman who is interested in my work replied mr dearborn i have never met him but he has never refused to produce a play of mine sometimes i think he does so because he wishes to help this home he must have some good reason said larry conversation flagged after this once a telephone buzzed and the superintendent took up a receiver from his table and listened yes i think you had better he said and hung up the receiver again a mundane question from the kitchen he smiled i have telephones fitted all over the house so far as our means allow us he added it saves so many journeys just then a deputation came from the common room with a grievance the men of no dormitory wish to go into their sleeping places some of them made a practice of sleeping the clock round and all of them whether they wanted to retire at once or not claimed their right to enter their dormitory you hear said the superintendent it is rather difficult for me larry nodded they can have beds at the nearest hotel he said and i will pay for them or they can sleep somewhere else i don t mind the beds being taken out but nobody occupies that room until miss ward is found he strolled out into the passage and walked to the common room these poor men were entitled to an explanation and he gave it stating the case fairly and simply and there was a chorus of approval even from the most obstreperous he had concluded his harangue and was standing in the passage with his back to the wall his head on his breast thinking when he heard a commotion upstairs and a cry and leapt up the stairs two at a time he got to the first landing and was turning when he saw a sight that brought his heart into his mouth walking slowly down the stairs toward him was diana ward her blouse hung in rags so that the under bodice and the snowy white of her shoulders were visible she carried in one hand a compact smith wesson revolver and on her white face was a smile of triumph for a second larry looked at her and then leapt up the remaining stairs to meet her and caught her in his arms my dear my dear he said brokenly thank god you have come back chapter xxv what happened to diana diana ward had strolled to the farther end of the dormitory and was feeling the texture of the rough sheets the housewife instinct in her was a strong one and her nurse s training had given her an additional interest in the means which were adopted to give comfort to these poor blind beggars for beggars most of them were she had heard the superintendent ask larry to open the window and she was watching idly when the door of the cupboard behind her opened without a sound and a barefooted man crept out the first thing that diana knew was that something like a piece of wet chamois leather was over her face and she was being lifted bodily for a second she was paralyzed and in that second she had passed through the cupboard and the wall behind both doors fastened for the back of the press as larry had suspected at first was a door that moved pegs and all outwards what he could not know was that it was literally a brick door she heard its thud as it closed and wriggling her face clear of the wet leather she screamed again a hand that was big enough to cover the whole of her face came over her mouth and she was dragged along in the darkness another door opened and she was thrown in there was a click and an electric light blazed from above and she saw her captor and shrank back in terror he was tall bigger than any man she had seen she guessed he was seven feet in height and his breadth was in proportion he was dressed in a shirt and a pair of trousers his feet and his arms were bare and she had no need to study that hairy forearm to appreciate its strength it was as massive as an average man s thigh and the muscles stood out in swathes his face was red and large and curiously flat his eyes which did not move when he spoke were of the palest blue and a mane of gray hair swept back from his forehead and hung untidily behind the mouth heavy and gross was covered by a short unkempt beard which was neither gray nor yellow but had something of each in its hue his enormous ears stuck out from his head almost at right angles and she thought she had never seen so terrible a creature in her life i ll let ye have a look at me so that ye ll know me again he giggled there was no other word that diana could think of that so described that shrill laugh of his where s your gun he bantered why don t you fire it at poor old jake he told you all about me i ll bet she knew that he referred to larry holt but made no reply her eyes were searching the room for some weapon but the rough plastered walls were bare and there was not a stick of furniture in the place the only window was a long narrow slip of toughened glass near the ceiling flanked on each side by two wall ventilators she searched her bag but there was nothing there she was even without hatpins though they would be practically useless against this brute looking for something to kill me with are you he giggled again i hear you now you sit down and be patient young woman he said there s a good time coming and nobody wants to hurt you he did not attempt to approach her and she had that relief but his next words told her that the real danger was but postponed ye re pretty by all accounts he chuckled and them as likes pretty ones might give the world for you it s a wonder to me that they ain t took ye my dear but they haven t any use for women or marriage and the like so they ve given ye to old jake he giggled again and the girl went cold at the sound he had a trick of pausing before and emphasizing they as though the word stood in capitals in his dark mind i can t see ye so prettiness don t mean much to me my little darling and if your face was like hers he jerked his thumb to the ceiling it wouldn t make no difference to me you ll never get out of this building she said realizing that it was best to show a bold attitude mr holt is in the house next door and by this time the place will be surrounded this time his chuckle had a deeper note there are ten ways out of the house he said contemptuously that s why they bought it there s a hole underneath the cellar where you can walk for miles and nobody there to stop you but the rats rats are afraid of blind men there was the hint of a curious childlike simplicity that ill fitted his monstrous shape sooner or later he will get you she said quietly and then with a sudden inspiration he has already got lew he was on the point of leaving the room and he spun round his face working lew he roared he s got lew then he was silent and the silence ended in a shout of laughter that seemed to shake the room lew will tell him a lot he said how s he going to ask lew for information when lew doesn t know where he is or who he s talking to he can t read or write he d have been dead too he nodded sagely dead as a door nail lew would have been for the dirty trick he played upon them he was the man who put the paper into the pocket of the feller they croaked we know that she said boldly and he seemed to be impressed you found that out did you he said but lew didn t tell ye he d have been dead as dead as a door nail lew would only they didn t want no dead men knocking about me and lew carried him down the steps he said nodding his great head i can tell you that because i know the lor i know the lor properly i do you can t tell old jake anything she was wondering what he meant by this boast of his knowledge of the law a wife can t give evidence against her husband he said with a little leer that s why i tell you all this little darling a wife she gasped sick at the ghastliness of the suggestion mrs jake bradford he chortled bradford is my name my darling and you ll be married by his reverence too proper and in order you fool she burst forth in her anger and fear do you think anybody could marry me to a horror like you do you think i should stand without protesting and telling all i know by your side you re mad he bent his head forward and his voice came lower as he spoke until it was little more than a whisper there s worse than me in this house he said slowly and maybe you won t mind me if you don t see me young lady and you may be blind as i am and deaf too like lew he paused and she shrank back holding on to the walls for support and dumb if you re going to talk he roared in a sudden fury there s nothing i wouldn t do to you if they told me to the door opened and closed a key turned and a bolt was shot and looking up she saw he was gone and slid to the floor half conscious half fainting then with an effort she drooped her head low and felt the blood coming back and presently she was able to stand no power of will could stop her hands from shaking and it was not until she had paced the room for ten minutes that she came back to anything like normal she knew that it was no idle threat this man had uttered he would be merciless if his unknown superiors gave the order he would crush out the youth and the beauty of youth the sweet senses of life without compunction at the word of them he would mutilate and torture and pity would not come to him she had to think clearly and think quickly she went to the door but she knew that escape that way was impossible there was no chair by which she could reach the window and she could not make her escape without even attracting attention through that slit of wall there was nothing in the room but the electric light she remembered larry s story of how this man had come toward him with his hands up and how he had crushed the bulb in his powerful fist he must be animal strong she thought wasn t there a danger of his being shocked by the electric current at that she looked up quickly the light had been fixed without any regard to appearance the long wire came from the ceiling at one end of the room and was loosely tacked to the ceiling as far as the centre where it passed over a hook and hung downwards with a little tin reflector over the pear shaped lamp she reached for the lamp and turned it round two hundred volts she read ground upon the crystal glass she tried to unhook the wire by throwing up the loose end but it was some time before she succeeded and at last the loose part fell and the lamp jerked to the floor and almost touched it she caught the loose flex in her hand and pulled gently and the thin wire brackets which held the flex to the ceiling came away without any difficulty the switch was near the door and she walked across and turned it off putting one foot upon the flex near to where it entered the aperture of the shade she pulled with all her might and after several attempts it snapped she was in darkness but her nimble fingers plucked at the loose end of the wire and with her finger nails she cleared away the rubber casing which enclosed the tiny thread like strands of copper soon she had something that felt like a loose haired broom in her hands and she was satisfied she thought she heard a noise in the passage and running to the switch turned the current on again she groped in the half darkness for her bag and found it took out her gloves and put them on then felt gingerly for the hanging strands she took them in her hands and held the brush before her being careful not to touch one exposed strand pushing away the shade and the globe with her foot she waited in the centre of the room and then the door opened here i am again dearie and her breath came quickly as she heard the door locked from the inside you think i m a funny looking fellow don t you he did not know that the light was out for he lived in everlasting darkness for a time he made no attempt to come near her she could just see the shape of him by the evening light which filtered through the narrow window tony missed him he said by way of conveying information missed him he said contemptuously if i d had my eyes i d have got the devil i d get him now with this little gun of mine blind as i am if i could hear him move but we ll have holty yet my darling we ll have him and cut his heart out he ll wish he was never born he lowered his voice and said something which was not intelligible to the girl then he seemed to recall the object of his visit come to old jake my dear he giggled as he walked stealthily toward her both of his huge arms outstretched come to your old husband my pretty he was as quick as a cat and one hand had gripped the shoulder of her blouse before she realized he was upon her gripped it and tore it from shoulder to hem she threw herself back and his other hand came up and touched the outspread wire with a yell that was half shriek half roar he fell back what did you do he asked savagely what did you do you little devil did you knife me like that swine he was evidently feeling himself to discover an injury and then he leapt at her and this time the wire struck his face and he fell to the ground like a log she heard him stir what is it what is it he whispered i can t see it you oughtn t to treat an old blind man like that you little his hand shot out and caught her ankle flinging her to the ground but again his face touched the electric wire charged with volts and he screamed and rolled over he was mad now a whimpering lunatic again and again he approached her again and again his hand his face his neck came into contact with the current and then suddenly he fell again and the girl thrust the cruel ends of the wire at his throat she felt like a murderess as he shivered convulsively but she had to kill him she knew that nothing short of killing him would save her life presently she took the wire away he lay very still and her shaking hands searched his pockets she found the key felt the revolver in his pocket and extracted it and fumbled for the lock presently the door was open and she was in the passage which turned to the right and along here she went she was in a lighter room with two windows but she was still in mortal terror for now she had lost her best weapon of defence the door was easy to find cleverly concealed it might be in the dormitory of todd s home but here it was well marked she pulled a handle and the mass of brickwork swung back and she walked through the door a man standing in the dormitory spun round a revolver in his hand good lord he cried miss ward where did you come from chapter xxvi back again that sense of security of peace and of deep happiness was inexpressibly sweet she thought as she lay in larry holt s arms presently she released herself and in a few hurried words had said enough to send a small battalion of detectives racing to the dormitory and through the brick door which she had left ajar larry handed the girl to the care of harvey and followed his men the room where diana had been imprisoned was empty he stopped long enough to switch off the current then joined the searchers there was no doubt that this place for all its unoccupied appearance had regular tenants they found rooms that had been built within rooms a thin wall being erected within a few feet of each window this meant that the house might be occupied at night and lights might blaze in every apartment without anybody outside being the wiser blind jake had said no more than the truth when he had told the girl that there were plenty of ways out of the house they found one in the cellar that led to an old disused rain water sewer and here pursuit was abandoned none of the party except larry who always carried a small flash lamp was equipped for a chase through the darkness another exit led directly into the yard where larry had found the garage a third communicated with the kitchen of todd s home larry realizing that his quarry had escaped went back to the girl he found her sitting in the superintendent s office the watchful harvey embarrassingly close to her side an attitude which was explained when the laughing girl lifted one of her arms for harvey who was taking no risks had handcuffed their wrists together and very wise too said larry with a smile as the detective unfastened the irons now mr dearborn i want to have some sort of explanation of the mysterious happenings in this house i don t think anything mysterious has happened here said mr dearborn quietly you cannot hold me responsible for villainy which may have been perpetrated next door i am told that there are doors communicating between these two houses but of that i had not the slightest knowledge if there was a man living next door there were six men living next door said larry we found their beds and some of their clothing from the fact that there were books some of them open it is pretty clear that they are not blind mr dearborn shrugged his despair what can i do he asked in this house we are dependent entirely upon the loyalty of our inmates and though it is possible sometimes to detect the presence of a stranger by his unusual footfalls his voice or his cough it is quite possible that these men made the freest use of the home for the purpose of carrying on their nefarious work without our having the slightest knowledge of such things this argument was so logical that larry did not contest its truth these cunning men who formed the gang might use the home with impunity if they exercised care in their movements and maintained silence frankly he acknowledged the reasonableness of mr dearborn s argument i quite appreciate the possibility he said it is rather unfortunate for you as well as for me it might have been a great deal more unfortunate he added with truth though how unfortunately this adventure might have ended he had to learn when the girl told her story on the way to scotland yard dreadful dreadful he shuddered my poor poor child his own relief had been so great that he felt physically ill but no such reaction was visible in the girl who grew calmer and brighter as the taxi neared scotland yard she wore his raincoat and they had stopped in the edgware road to allow her to buy a blouse for she insisted upon going to scotland yard first to make her statement i m rather sorry for dearborn he said he is a pathetic figure men who devote their lives to this kind of work may be excused even their feeble dramatic efforts did you notice how eagerly he shook hands with you she looked at him sharply yes i noticed that she said in a strange tone why diana he said what do you mean oh nothing she said lightly i mean that he took my hand that is all and shook it very heartily well there s nothing in that said larry with a smile there is a great deal in that said the girl a great deal more than you can realize he leaned back in the cab and laughed softly you re going to mystify me i can feel it coming on he said and she squeezed his arm affectionately he sent her up to alone and she had changed her torn blouse for the new purchase by the time he discreetly knocked at the door by the way he said i forgot to ask you where did you dig up that deadly looking weapon i saw in your hand as you were coming down the stairs from blind jake s pocket she said ugh it was horrid touching him but i wanted to be quite sure that i had some kind of weapon undoubtedly you have a big end of the story he said we know now that blind jake and the man lew have you left him there she asked quickly he smiled a little wryly i ve made too many mistakes in this case to add to them he said no i have taken this man to another institution where he is being looked after lew and jake were the two men who were employed either before or after the murder of gordon stuart he went on the gang has probably got a hold on lew and he was anxious to escape from their clutches or to be avenged upon them for some treachery they have committed and he wrote the message which we found on the strip of paper with the braille characters that fines the search down to one man because we can find means of inducing lew to understand whose hands he is in and the greatest discovery of all you haven t touched she said quietly larry got up from his chair laughing and paced the room a favourite occupation of his you re an extraordinary girl he said no sooner do i think i have got the case set than you produce something new something more important in the shape of clues and something generally he added pensively that upsets all my previous theories i don t think this will she said i am referring to the woman upstairs what woman upstairs he asked astounded do you remember i told you that jake pointed with his thumb to the ceiling and said if i had a face like hers she stopped i m sorry he said gently i m a brute and a forgetful brute but things have happened to day which have driven the stuart case out of my mind and that reminds me he said i want to telephone he called a number and she recognized it as the number of the trafalgar hospital i want the matron s office please he said and whilst she was wondering where his mind had led him he said is that you matron it is i larry holt yes how do you do are the nurses you send out to cases having a slack time i mean are there plenty to go round there are well will you send a nice motherly lady to my address at regent s gate gardens you know where i live no i m not ill he smiled but i have somebody with me who isn t too well yes a lady he hung up the receiver and turned to meet the girl s astonished eyes have you a lady staying with you she asked i haven t but i shall have said larry you re not going back to charing cross road to night except to get the things you require you re coming up to my flat and there you re going to stay chaperoned by a very nice nurse and you ll greatly oblige me if you ll pretend that you re a little bit under the weather i must save my face but i can t it s impossible she said scarlet of face i couldn t oh yes you could said larry now you re going to do as i tell you otherwise it means that i must sit outside your flat all night catching my death of cold finally she consented they dined together and he took her to see two acts of the dearborn play they came out at the end of the second act bewildered but how could anybody put such awful stuff on the stage asked the girl on their way to his flat it is rather amazing isn t it then larry began to chuckle you re easily amused to day she said i m very happy to night he corrected it just occurred to me that sunny will have to meet the nurse when she comes whatever will he say she gasped well drawled larry if the nurse insists there s a lady ill in the house sunny will say yes madam and will do his best to produce one it was past eleven when they got to the flat the elevators had stopped running at half past ten and they had to walk up the stairs watch your step warned larry they light these stairways abominably he went first and she saw him pause on the top step of the second flight great scott who s that he asked against his door a man was lying doubled up and still larry leant over him and rang the bell and sunny came to the door in the flood of light thrown by the hall lamp larry saw the face of the prostrate figure he was breathing stertorously and his face and his head streamed with blood sunny has the nurse arrived yes sir said sunny looking down at the figure then she ll be wanted said larry quietly who is it asked diana peering round behind him flash fred said larry and as near to dead as makes no difference chapter xxvii john dearborn is not blind they carried the injured man into the sitting room and laid him on a couch there was a doctor living in the flat above and luckily he had not gone to bed and was down in a few minutes he is badly injured he reported there are one or two knife wounds and the wound in the head looks as though there were a fracture of the skull the man must have been attacked outside my door said larry he couldn t have walked far in this condition no said the doctor shaking his head he might have walked two or three yards but the chances are as you found him outside the door that he was there when the attack was made on him do you know him yes said larry he is an old acquaintance of mine is there any danger of his dying a very big danger replied the doctor gravely that concussion may be anything i should send him straight away to hospital where he can be thoroughly examined and if necessary operated upon the ambulance had come and gone and the only evidence of flash fred s visit was a few dark stains about the door before larry began to think consecutively the nurse who had arrived fulfilled all his telephoned requirements she was stout and jovial and matronly and the first use larry made of his freedom from distraction was to tell her in a few words just why she had been sent for obviously i could not allow miss ward to go back to charing cross road after her terrible experience to day he said and nurse james who was by no means dissatisfied with having so easy a case agreed she exercised her authority to the extent of ordering diana to bed immediately and the girl meekly obeyed but she could not sleep at two o clock larry writing at his table heard the creak of an opening door and looked up to see her she was in her dressing gown and her hair was braided in a long golden plait i can t sleep she said restlessly almost irritably and he saw that she was overstrung and rose to get an armchair for her she neither apologized for her attire nor her visitation and these circumstances struck larry as curious but that which was on diana ward s mind was of so great an importance that the thought of decorum did not occur to her she sat there her hands folded on her lap and there was no sound save the tick of a clock on the mantelpiece and the squeak of larry s chair as it turned what is troubling you diana he asked she looked up at him quickly do you think i m troubled she said if you re not you re a wonderful girl said larry gently you ve had an awful time to day my dear but somehow i do not think that that is what is on your mind she shook her head it isn t and added it is the woman upstairs the woman upstairs oh you mean the woman that jake spoke about but diana there was no upstairs you were on the top floor of that building which is a story lower than todd s home but still she was not satisfied besides he went on quietly if she had been there the woman may have been as bad a character as any of the other occupants of that house the fact that she was unpleasant to look at as jake suggested does not make her innocent poor soul poor soul said the girl and then to larry s horror she began to weep softly i can t sleep for thinking of her she sobbed they will keep her they dare not let her go why he gasped suddenly you don t suggest that she is clarissa stuart she looked up at that her face stained with tears clarissa stuart she repeated slowly no i don t think she is clarissa stuart then who is she he asked at any rate who do you think she is i don t think i am sure she said speaking with painful slowness that woman was emma the charwoman of the boarding house and larry jumped to his feet the charwoman he said slowly you re right again the tick of the little clock asserted itself as they sat busy with their own thoughts you connect this terrible gang with the stuart mystery he said she nodded i also connect them said larry for very excellent reasons and yet i cannot see what they gained by stuart s death unless they were in league with this girl who calls herself clarissa stuart she made a hopeless little gesture and rose i can connect them all she said they are very distinct in their relationships but then with a faint smile i have an advantage over you you have many advantages over me said larry humouring her and now dear you must go back and sleep but she did not heed him there is only one i did not connect she went on and you have made his case understandable who is that flash fred she replied he is just a criminal who has touched the fringe of the conspiracy and has been in it without knowing he was in it she nodded as though she had only at that moment decided her point of view but the others blind jake who works for an unknown master the charwoman the greatest victim of them all poor lew with his deaf ears and his blistered fingers you didn t see those i should have told you only the doctor interrupted us blistered fingers said larry in amazement no i didn t see them i felt them she shuddered when he touched my face his fingers and thumbs have been blistered at the tops but why so that he shall not read braille or write braille said the girl quietly it s impossible impossible said larry in horror there cannot be such villainy in the world my child i have been acquainted with some of the worst crimes that have ever been committed in europe i have seen the victims i have tracked and hanged the criminals men are cruel vicious unscrupulous and bloody minded but they do not commit such cold blooded deeds as you say have been committed upon that poor blind man she smiled again i don t think you realize just how bad these people are she said for if you did you would never say that it was impossible for dearborn she began and he laughed outright diana dear you ve reached the stage which we always reach when you re suspicious of everybody not of poor john dearborn working for the good of humanity in that slum and amidst those fearful people she nodded i shook hands with john dearborn when i went there i shook hands with him when i came away she said that doesn t make him a criminal he smiled and when i offered my hand he took it she said please remember that i was a nurse in a blind asylum for two years when i offered my hand he took it well why shouldn t he asked larry in surprise he shouldn t have seen it said the girl if he was blind and john dearborn is no more blind than you or i chapter xxviii who runs dearborn say that again said larry slowly you offered your hand and he took it she nodded don t you know that when you shake hands with the blind you always reach out and take their hand because they cannot see yours offered but dearborn raised his just as soon as i raised mine larry was staring helplessly at her if he is not blind why is he there he asked he is a clergyman there is no john dearborn in the clergy list said the girl calmly i went carefully through the list and he is not amongst the congregational the baptist or the wesleyan ministers larry looked at her lost in admiration you re a wonder but don t forget that he came from australia the australian lists are available said the girl immediately and the only john dearborn is an aged gentleman who lives at totooma and is obviously not our john dearborn she had come to the table and had drawn a chair up close she now leant forward her hands clasped in front of her larry she said i m going to call you larry out of office hours has it not struck you as strange that john dearborn s plays should be produced at a theatre remembering that he has written a succession of failures i ve always thought that larry admitted and she nodded her head i wish you would look into the directorate of the macready she said find out what comprises the syndicate which puts up the money for producing these plays i don t forget that mr stuart disappeared from that theatre nor i said larry quietly but john dearborn you amaze me she rose i feel sleepy now that i have got that off my mind she smiled are you she hesitated watching the laundry i have two men there who are instructed to stop any car coming out and discover who is the driver and what the car contains then i can go to bed cheerfully she said with a little laugh and passing him she rested her hand gently on his head they will keep emma alive for some time yet the only danger is that they may take her away from the laundry you can rest your mind on that said larry quietly and with this assurance she went to bed and he heard her door close the next day was uneventful the police had made a further search of the laundry and had discovered a room above that in which the girl had been imprisoned it was a very tiny attic apartment but showed signs of having been occupied though it was empty when the police made their call larry cursed himself that he had not made a more thorough inspection of the premises he had been so relieved at the discovery of the girl that he had not been as painstaking as he should have been this he told himself disgustedly there were two people whom he desired greatly to meet the first of these was the man who had lost the little finger of his left hand that curious individual who had preceded him the day he was investigating the reason for gordon stuart s mysterious visits to a country churchyard the second was the mysterious emma in his heart of hearts he knew that emma would supply the key which would unlock the door to great and conclusive revelations i shall never forgive myself he told diana if any harm comes to this woman she shook her head you need not fear that they will do her harm she said she is much too valuable and i shall know just when her danger period commences you he said in surprise really diana you scare me sometimes she laughed and her laughter was drowned in the rattle of her typewriter flash fred has not recovered consciousness yet he told her but there s a big chance that he will the doctors say that there is no actual fracture and that there is a possibility that the pressure which now keeps him unconscious will disperse where is he she asked in st mary s hospital replied larry i have him in a private ward with a police officer on guard not that poor fred could escape he smiled but there are people in this city who will probably be most anxious that he escape by the only way which leaves them safe she did not need to ask which way that was he put down the pen he had been holding though he had done very little writing it wouldn t be a bad idea if we went along to st mary s and discovered at first hand how the man is he said will you come as she put on her hat before the four inch square of looking glass which she had imported into the building she asked without turning her head what are you going to do about john dearborn larry rubbed his chin i hardly know he said it is not an offence for a man to pretend to be blind if he isn t besides he continued he might have had sufficient sight to have seen your hand there may be a dozen explanations he could have offered his hand mechanically almost instinctively she nodded it is possible she said quietly but he smiled too when i smiled who wouldn t said larry gallantly in the business like office of the senior house surgeon at st mary s they met the surgeon in charge of the case you ve come at a very fortunate moment he smiled your man has recovered consciousness can he talk asked larry eagerly i think so at any rate i see no particular reason why he shouldn t if there is urgent necessity for your questioning him naturally he is still very weak and in ordinary circumstances i should not allow anybody to interview him but i gather that you have particular police business very particular said larry grimly the surgeon led the way to the ward at the door of the ward the girl hesitated shall i come she said your presence is necessary said larry if it is only in a professional capacity have you got your notebook she nodded and they went into the little private ward where fred grogan lay his head was swathed in bandages and his face was white and drawn but his eyes lit up at the sight of larry i never expected to look forward to seeing you he said but first of all governor his voice was earnest you ought to get hold of that woman in the boiler house the woman in the boiler house repeated larry quickly what do you mean clarissa s nurse was the staggering reply and who clarissa is the lord knows chapter xxix flash fred s story now i m going to give it to you straight governor said fred settling himself comfortably in bed i won t say that i couldn t tell a lie that s the one saying of napoleon s that i ve never believed the same period but another man said larry concealing a smile but don t worry about your history fred i want you to get this story off your mind as quickly as you can i ve done a lot of reading in my time said the sick man reminiscently histories and high class novels they ve got a pretty good library in portland prison but they re not so good as the books you get in wormwood scrubs anyway i am going to tell you the truth mr holt i might as well start at the beginning and i know i m going to put myself in wrong but you ll have to forget a lot of the things i tell you because they make me look as if i was a dishonest person i should hate that impression to get abroad said larry without a smile and i promise you that anything which doesn t relate directly to the murder of gordon stuart will be discreetly forgotten cheerio said fred visibly brighter well this story begins about four or five years ago in montpellier you don t know montpellier perhaps i know it said larry you can cut out all the topographical details i know it from the coq d or to the palace i happened to be there said fred looking round and enjoying myself and i drifted into a little game that was run by a man named floquart on the quiet it was baccarat and i m very lucky at baccarat especially when i ve made friends with the dealer but this time the dealer and me weren t on speaking terms as you might say and for three days i never felt money that wasn t my own and each day there was less of my own to feel then one night they cleaned me out proper and i left floquart s with just enough to get me home to the hotel if i walked i was turning out of the rue narbonne when i heard a shot and looking across the place i saw a man lying on the ground and another fellow walking away pretty slick in those days the police arrangements at montpellier weren t all they could have been and there wasn t a gendarme in sight the fellow who was walking must have thought he d got away with it when i suddenly came up to him there was just enough light for the day was breaking for me to distinguish his face a fine looking fellow he was with a big yellow beard and i think he was scared sick when i suddenly stepped out and claimed him as my own it was not my business to butt into private disturbances but you understand that i was broke and i thought that here was a chance of helping a fellow creature in distress to get rid of any incriminating money he might have in his possession he told me a yarn that the man he d shot had done him a very bad injury which i won t refer to in front of the young lady and then he slipped me about sixteen thousand francs and i let him go because i was sorry for him he glanced slyly up at larry and grinned well he went on seeing that no gendarme had appeared i walked over and had a look at the lad who was shot though i knew i was taking a risk by being seen in the company of a soon to croak they say he was shot and must have died immediately but that isn t true he was alive when i got to him and when i was bending over him it was to find out if i could do anything for the poor devil before he passed out i asked him who had shot him and he replied he paused impressively david judd larry s eyebrows went up david judd he asked is he any relation to the doctor his brother said fred that s how i came to know him i ve always told judd that i recognized him in the street as a matter of fact it was the poor guy on the ground who gave him away i was trying to find out why he was shot when he croaked i knew there was nothing to be gained by being found attached to a murdered man though fortunately i hadn t a gun in my possession and could have proved an alibi then i heard a gendarme s heavy feet coming down one of the side turnings and i got away as quickly as i could but the swine recognized me though and i had to go before an examining magistrate and prove that i had nothing to do with the murder and that i was going for a doctor when i was spotted i had the good sense to go for a doctor he added the moment i realized that the copper had seen me he paused finding it rather difficult to explain subsequent action in language which would be wholly creditable to himself when i got back to london i thought it my duty to call on mr david judd he said he wasn t in his office he used to have a room at the greenwich insurance but i saw his brother and i unloaded my trouble your trouble being to discover how much they d drop for keeping your mouth shut i suppose said larry you ve got it at once mr holt what a mind said the admiring fred he was terribly upset was dr judd and said he would see his brother as soon as he came back from the country and then happened an event which looked like spoiling all my beautiful prospects dr david died he caught a cold coming down from scotland and died in twenty four hours i went to the funeral said fred as a mourner and i bet that nobody mourned more than i did anyway i must say that dr judd acted like a gentleman he sent for me after his brother s funeral and said that he wanted to save his brother s memory from disgrace and offered me a yearly income if i would keep my mouth shut the man who was killed was a clerk was he not asked larry he was a clerk said fred slowly a clerk in the employ of the greenwich insurance company who had blackmailed david judd larry whistled softly the greenwich insurance company he said and blackmailed david why what crime had david committed fred shook his head i can t tell you that mr holt if i could i would but it was something pretty bad you can bet dr judd said that this clerk had pinched a lot of money and i think that s true because i remember his playing and playing very high at floquart s well to cut this story short i ve drawn about four years income from dr judd i m not apologizing or trying to prove to you that i acted like a little gentleman that doesn t interest you anyway the other day i met the doctor at a wedding he was invited but i wasn t explained fred shamelessly but that didn t make any difference i went he asked me if i d go to dinner with him last night at his house in chelsea he s got a real fine house has dr judd full of wonderful pictures and sparklers and as he was going to pay me a lump sum to get rid of me i decided to go there is a man at the doctor s he said after a pause a valet i don t want to give him away mr holt but he s an old lag and was in the next cell to me at portland his name is strauss said larry he takes drugs and has had three convictions oh you know that do you said fred in surprise well anyway i know him i met him in piccadilly the other day he was going to fence a few articles that he d pinched from his boss and he dropped me a pair of sleeve links larry gasped oh that is where they came from they were dr judd s i ain t so sure that they were dr judd s said fred from what i have heard the doctor has people who stay with him over week ends and strauss may have pinched them from one of these anyway again he hesitated finding it difficult to express his plans in such a manner as would save him from the charge of ingratitude i had an idea of helping myself to a few souvenirs of dr judd before i went he explained and i d fixed it up with strauss so that i could just look over the premises and pick a few things that would remind me of my old friend so when i was asked to dinner naturally i jumped at the chance i don t say that i d have gone alone to dinner because the doctor and me aren t quite bosom companions but he told me that there was a lot of people coming so i went i was supposed to go at eight which is well after dark but to the opposite side of the street because i was anxious to see dr judd s guests arrive before i got in i waited till eight and nobody came i waited till half past eight and then i saw the doctor come out and look up and down the road i was so hungry that i nearly went over to him but i didn t see myself dining alone with a fellow that i ve been swindling so i waited and waited and presently a motor car drove up and went straight to the gates at the side of the house i thought he was going to push them in but the moment the head lamps touched the gates they opened that s funny says i to myself and i crossed the road and had a look over the top of the gate it meant a bit of a climb but i did it without making any noise and the first fellow that got out of the car was that big stiff who tried to croak me in jermyn street blind jake said larry i ve never been introduced replied the other sardonically i saw him plain for a minute because he passed in front of the head lamps and then the lights went out and i saw nothing more at ten o clock the gates opened like magic it was for there was nobody near them and a car came out it passed me going slow and i ran behind and jumped on to the luggage carrier which was down i got off as it went into the king s road chelsea because there is a lot of light there and a copper might have seen me and given me away but there were plenty of taxis about and i hired one and told him to keep the car in sight i wanted to know where blind jake that s his name is it was living and i didn t have much difficulty in keeping the car in sight we went up past victoria along grosvenor place up park lane i was afraid the car would turn into the park for private cars are allowed there but taxis aren t and i should have lost him but luckily or unluckily it didn t the car went up edgware road tyburn tree where they hanged them in the old days used to be there he said apropos of nothing i read that in a book when i was in stir cut out those memories of old london begged larry i followed up close behind and then the machine turned into some side streets said fred and i took the risk of paying off the cabman and following on foot i know that district pretty well and i hadn t been searching for ten minutes before i saw the car pulling up against a gate which was set into a high wall the driver must have missed the way because i was there almost as soon as the doctor dr judd was he there asked larry flash fred nodded and was very sorry for himself that he had done so it was some time before he could speak again if i don t keep my blinking head still he said good humouredly i shall lose it yes the doctor was there i was close up to them as a matter of fact i was standing behind the car when they all three got out blind jake was one a fellow i didn t recognize was another and the doctor was the third he had a bag in his hand and he seemed to be a bit put out i protest against being sent for at this hour of the night he said the other man not blind jake said something in a low voice which i didn t catch why couldn t you have got another doctor remember that you have forced me to come here and i come under protest where is this woman he asked and i don t think the reply was intended for my ears for the big blind man said in the boiler house and laughed and the other fellow turned to him with a curse and told him to keep quiet they went through the gates and presently the car moved on i think it had to turn and the street wasn t wide enough the gate was locked and it had been painted black but i saw that the word laundry had been there before the new coat had been put on did you notice the name of the street asked larry reville street said the other to larry s surprise and then he remembered that is the street behind and running parallel with lissom lane he said go on fred well i had to slip away otherwise i should have been seen i went all round the house and came back behind it just as the doctor came out and this time there were only two of them the big blind man had gone i couldn t hear what they were talking about but presently i heard the doctor say good night and the car drove off the other man was looking after the tail lights and i had nothing to do but to slouch past as though i had been coming along walking all the time if there s one bad habit that s worse than another said fred reflectively it s talking to yourself whether you talk in your sleep or while you re awake but there are some men who can t help it there was a pal of mine in barcelona however i won t talk about him mr holt well this man that was left standing was one of that kind a brooder i should think and before i got opposite to him i heard him muttering as he stood stock still his hands behind him looking after the car and the words that i heard as i passed were these i remember them sort of committed them to memory and the words were clarissa s nurse he said it twice i walked on never dreaming that he d spotted me and as i walked i thought now the best thing you can do fred is to go straight to mr holt and tell him what you ve seen and what you ve heard larry nodded i was only a few hundred yards from your house so i made up my mind i d do it i hadn t gone very far when i got an uncomfortable feeling that i was being followed i couldn t see anybody but i had that creepy sensation that you get when the splits are after you and i couldn t shake it off i got into your street and began looking for the block where your flat was i passed it once and was directed back here and i think that the people who were following me must have slipped in and got upstairs and were waiting for me when i came up i remember putting my hand up to the knocker of your flat and then i don t remember anything more the girl had been writing rapidly and now she closed her book i think that s about all said fred weakly i d like a drink ten minutes later two motor cars laden with plain clothes officers were on their way westward and the inhabitants of the little street upon which the laundry backed were interested spectators of another raid what is this wall asked larry of his assistant it is the wall of the laundry building proper said harvey i inspected it very carefully but there was nothing there did you see the boiler house yes sir it is a very ordinary underground room with one large boiler and a steam engine get that door open said larry you have got some men in lissom lane to watch the other gate yes sir reported the sergeant and with an expert hand he manipulated the lock and presently the door swung wide the room into which the door directly led was in darkness it proved when lights were obtained to be a long brick shed with a concrete floor and four rows of trestles down the centre where in the days of the laundry the washerwomen worked a flight of steps guarded by a rail went down to a lower floor and larry led the way into the boiler house chapter xxx in the tubular room you ought to be ashamed of yourself said blind jake shaking his huge head he sat huddled up at one side of the tubular room and his remarks were addressed to a wretched looking woman who sat on the other side her arms folded on her knees her head bent in dejection she was miserably clad her hanging hair was streaked with gray and her hands and face were grimy the room itself could hardly be described as a room it was like an enlarged gas main the floor was littered with fragments of rubble and broken concrete one end was a steel door just large enough for a medium sized person to squeeze through and the other was a jagged hole torn in the steel wall and disclosing beyond a black void which in the light of the candle was also littered with rubbish you ought to be ashamed of yourself reproved blind jake here are they doing all they can for ye ye ugly old devil and ye re whining and snarling like a pup who s had his tail bit the woman moaned and said something you d have something to snivel about if i had my way said blind jake don t we feed ye didn t we give ye a good bed to lie on till that dog came nosing about i want to go away said the woman you re killing me here not yet said blind jake with a chuckle maybe they ll want ye killed and then ye ll be killed sure i want to go out of this horrible place cried the woman with a sob why am i here do ye want to be down with the rats growled blind jake didn t ye squeak and squeal when i took ye down in the long passage under the street because the little fellows squeaked at you and now ye re safe and sound where a rat couldn t get ye and to morrow you re going into a nice house to live with fine sheets on your bed you ungrateful old devil she raised her woebegone face and looked at the blind man curiously you talk about em as though they were gods she said one of these days they ll betray you shut up snapped the man you don t know em what have they done for me they ve given me a lovely life all the money i want everything i can eat and drink they gave me a young wife he chuckled but the chuckle ended with a hideous distortion of face i ll have her yet she nearly killed me that wench who was she asked the woman never ye mind nobody ye know said jake but did not seem disinclined to talk on the matter a young white sleek girl she was he said they wanted her because she s police too she was silent for so long that he leant forward and touched her with his big hand you re not having a fit are ye he said with a note of anxiety not another one of them fits we can t always bring a doctor the next time i ll rouse ye he said menacingly i ll make ye wake he shook her savagely i m awake i m awake she said terrified please don t do that you will break my arm well behave yourself he grumbled and then began to crawl slowly toward the farther end of the tubular room even the woman though she was far from tall could not have stood upright in that cramped space it was wonderful how a man so big could man uvre himself through the jagged hole in the steel and crawl into the space beyond she heard him tossing bricks about and enlarging the cavity at which he had been working all the day she wondered where she was for she had been a sick woman when she had been dragged into that terrible chamber and had no recollection of how she had come in only she knew that people were searching for her and that the awful forces which now held her prisoner were determined that she should not be found she had been hidden in the depths of the earth in hideous places alive with terrifying life and this at least was better when he came back she said mr stuart would give you a lot of money if you took me to him he chuckled ye ve told me that a hundred times ye fool he said and mimicked her if you take me to mr stuart he ll give ye a lot of money a lot of money he ll give me i nursed his children she wailed and his poor wife and when i got married he gave me a beautiful wedding ring aw shut up snarled the man haven t ye got anything more to talk about a hundred million times ye ve told me about nursing his babies and your blasted wedding ring when i told him about clarissa he said he d give me a thousand pounds whispered the woman i was that surprised to see him i nearly fell down blind jake ignored her he had heard this story before and it had lost all its novelty he never knew about the twins and thought he had no children alive if ye hadn t been a hook or a soak y could have told him where she was but don t worry yer head they ve found her a fine lady she is with plenty of money i heard em say that she was a fine lady with plenty of money he added simply his faith in these mysterious employers of his knew no bounds i was fond of my drop confessed the half witted woman and they sent me to prison for nothing at all and the home was awful suddenly blind jake lurched forward and dropped his hands upon her shoulders she opened her mouth to scream but he put his face close to hers if y squeal ye re dead my lady be quiet his sensitive ears had caught the sound of footsteps on the floor above though they were so completely deadened that none but a blind man would have heard them he crept closer to her side put one great arm around her shoulder the other he held just in front of her face if y squeal ye re dead he said again and then somebody knocked at the little door at the end of the chamber and the voice of larry holt demanded is there anybody here chapter xxxi fred lends his keys it had been diana ward who had called larry s attention to the great rusty boiler at one end of the house the boiler which had supplied the steam and the power for the laundry larry tried the thick iron door which opened into the furnace but it was fast he tugged again and it did not move nobody could be here he said shaking his head what do you think harvey they would suffocate anyway in there sir replied sergeant harvey the girl was looking distressed is there nowhere else she asked i did hope she did not finish her words no miss we ve searched the whole of the place now said the sergeant would you like that door forced open sir he asked it will take some hours larry shook his head no i don t think so he said i am inclined to agree with you that if anybody was concealed in the boiler supposing there were room enough which is unlikely they would die of suffocation do you think asked the girl as they came away that mr grogan was telling the truth i know he was she added quickly i don t know why i ask such stupid questions oh he was telling the truth all right said larry fred isn t a model of virtue but in this case i believe him it s just the luck of the game he said bitterly sometimes i feel that i m never going to fathom this mystery it will be solved and solved within a week she said and she spoke with such assurance that he could only stare at her then you re going to solve it he said for i have reached the point and it is the most dangerous point that a detective can arrive at when i am suspicious of everybody suspicious of dr judd of the innocent mr dearborn of flash fred the chief commissioner and you he added good humouredly but she did not smile i wondered how long it would be before you suspected me she said gravely she went off with harvey and he returned to the hospital for he had a few more questions to ask the injured crook flash fred listened attentively and when larry had finished god knows i have never trusted a policeman in my life he said piously but i think you re different mr holt in one of my pockets you will find the key of my safe deposit the hospital people have the clothes it s the deposit in chancery lane and i m trusting you he said whimsically there are things in that box that i shouldn t like anybody to see but you will find what you are looking for without disturbing them there s a bundle of war stock he said uneasily which i bought by the sweat of my brow somebody sweated i ll bet said larry cheerfully you needn t be afraid fred i shan t pry into your secrets nor shall i use anything i find there to jail you fred was ill at ease i knew i was taking a risk when i told you about this business he said because you were certain to go farther in it and i was just as certain to help you if i d been out and about it would have been easy because i could have given you the keys what are the keys asked larry they re duplicates that i had made said fred without a blush strauss got them from the doctor s key ring when he was asleep and took the impressions strauss ain t a bad fellow but he dopes i never did hold with those evil practices said the virtuous fred you want a clean eye and a clear brain to get on in life don t you mr holt and eight nimble fingers plus two nippy thumbs said larry he secured the keys without difficulty and half an hour later he walked into room humming a tune and jingling flash fred s nefarious possessions in his pocket diana after a great deal of persuasion had been induced to take up her residence under larry s eye the motherly nurse had become a permanent institution at regent s gate gardens a circumstance which was not wholly to the liking of mr patrick sunny who found himself forced to sleep on a camp bed in the kitchen i am sorry to inconvenience you sunny said larry holt that night and it is an inconvenience i suppose yes sir said sunny it is an inconvenience not a painful one i hope no sir said sunny it is not a painful one the lady was in danger said larry and this sunny knew because the matter had been discussed very freely in his presence and it was impossible to leave her in her apartment yes sir agreed sunny what collar will you be wearing to day sir any old collar said larry with a smile anyway sunny the lady is safe sleeping in this flat no sir said sunny and larry was shocked for it was the first time in his life that sunny had ever disagreed with him no he said incredulously didn t you hear what i said i said the lady is safe here no sir said sunny i m very sorry sir and i beg your pardon but no you mean i suppose why isn t she safe because you re not safe sir said sunny calmly and if you re not safe the lady s not safe sir larry laughed all right have your own way he said and sunny yes sir will you close the kitchen door to night i could hear you turning around in your bed and it woke me up very good sir i will close the kitchen door said sunny and in truth he did after larry had gone to bed and the flat was in silence sunny carried his little camp bedstead into the hall placed it so that its foot was about fifteen inches from the door balanced a broom the head against the door the end of the handle resting on the bed and then he retired but he shut the kitchen door at two o clock in the morning a key was placed noiselessly in the lock and the door was pushed open a few inches and the broom fell ruthlessly on sunny s head it might have brained him but by a fortunate accident didn t larry heard three shots fired in rapid succession and leapt out of bed and came into the passage gun in hand he saw an empty camp bedstead an open door but sunny was gone he ran down the stairs and met that worthy man returning leading by the collar a diminutive ruffian upon whose evil face was stamped a twisted grin of pain for he had a bullet in the fleshy part of his leg bring him in said larry and closed the door diana was standing in the passage when the man was marched through and hastily withdrew to reappear again at the informal inquiry which larry instituted it was an inquiry prefaced by a respectful apology on the part of sunny i beg your pardon sir for taking the loan of your pistol he said and as to my bed being in the passage and disturbing you say no more about that sunny my lad said larry with a grateful glance at his valet we ll talk about that afterwards now my boy what have you to say for yourself he addressed the unpleasant looking prisoner he ain t got no right to use firearms said the man hoarsely larry thought his hoarseness was due to his emotion but it would seem that it was his natural voice i m shot i am i was coming down the stairs as quiet and as peaceful as possible when this fellow came out and shot me innocent child said larry unpleasantly he felt over the man s pocket and took out a long bladed knife the edge of which he tested with his finger and thumb it was razor sharp larry looked at the man again he was about thirty five hollow cheeked and sunken eyed let me see your hands said larry and the man with a scowl put them out have you any convictions no sir said the man sullenly who sent you here find out i am going to find out said larry softly and you will be a little damaged in the finding who sent you here i m not going to tell said the man i think you will said larry and led him into the kitchen and shut the door when the police arrived ten minutes later they took charge of a very shaky man he has told all he knows said larry he was sent here to cover another man who escaped he swears he does not know who the other man was but it was evidently not blind jake how did you induce him to tell asked the girl a little fearfully i threatened to wash him said larry and he spoke no more than the truth it was not the threat of the washing of course he explained it was the being in that room alone with me and the fact that i could strip off his coat without an effort and the possibility that the washing was merely a preliminary to some form of horrible torture which i had invented which made him talk his wound is nothing by the way it will probably be healed by the time he sees the divisional surgeon and now i think we can all go to bed i want to see you sunny before you retire for the night what he said to sunny set that stolid man strutting for the rest of the week chapter xxxii a breakfast proposal a thin white mist overhung the park and shrouded the deserted stretch of rotten row and the one or two riders who had come out at this early hour for their constitutional merely served to emphasize the desolation of the place one of these horsemen was sir john hason chief commissioner of police who made it a practice to ride before breakfast and he neither expected nor invited company he was therefore surprised and a little annoyed when a horseman came up from behind him and checking his mount to a walk fell in by sir john s side hallo larry said john hason in surprise this is an unexpected apparition i thought you were a ghost i shall be that too one of these fine mornings said larry unless i m jolly careful i knew you would be riding so i hired a hack from the local livery stable and came out besides he said i want a change of air and i want to talk outside the stultifying atmosphere of your office anything new asked sir john there was an attempt at assassination last night but that s so usual that i hate reporting it as a novelty said larry and told the story of the two o clock visitation it s the queerest case i ve ever heard about said sir john hason thoughtfully not a day passes but somebody new comes in you still attach importance to the charwoman larry nodded you know london better than i john he said for between him and his old schoolmate there was no formality on such occasions as this who is judd oh judd laughed the commissioner i don t think you need worry your head about him he is a man of some standing in the city though i seem to have heard that his brother was rather a waster the judds practically own all the shares in the greenwich insurance company it is not a very big concern but it has successfully resisted every attempt on the part of the insurance trusts and the big companies to absorb it that shows character which i admire they inherited the shares from their father and built up what looked to be a very shaky concern into a fairly prosperous business i was looking at the board of directors last night said larry it is in the stock exchange year book i sat up after everybody had gone to bed and tried to puzzle things out do you know that john dearborn is a director of that company dearborn the dramatist asked hason quickly no i did not know of course the directors in a company like that he smiled are merely the nominees of judd judd is a very good fellow i am told and spends a lot of money in charity he practically supports the home which dearborn is running he may have been given an ornamental directorship in order to bring in a little money to his institute i thought of that too nodded larry who is walters never heard of him said john hason he s another director of the company and also an ornamental person i should imagine and cremley ernest john cremley of wimbledon he is most certainly an ornamental person said the commissioner i know him slightly a man with very little brains and an insatiable appetite for cards why do you ask because these two men are also directors of the macready theatre syndicate said larry quietly judd s name does not appear but there is another strange name which is probably a nominee of his where are we getting to asked the commissioner we re getting here said larry reining in his horse and bringing it round so that he stood side by side and facing his chief that judd controls the theatre where dearborn s plays are produced so there is some association between judd and the superintendent of the blind mission in paddington sir john digested this fact before he spoke i don t see that there is anything particularly blameworthy about that he said after all dearborn is only the victim of blind jake and from what you told me in your report last night judd is the victim of nobody except our friend flash fred i can well understand why the doctor wanted to save his brother s name he went on judd adored that younger brother of his thought he was the finest fellow in the world i have never seen a case where brothers entertained such affection one for the other the week david judd died the doctor shut himself up and would not see anybody what the the commissioner s note of startled surprise was justified for larry had suddenly brought round his horse and was riding furiously across the park taking no small risk from the low railings he leapt he had seen a figure unmistakably tall muffled to the chin in a pea jacket slouching along the path that led to one of the gates of the park the man heard the gallop of hoofs and ran as straight and as swift as a deer gained the gates and ran out into the street the gate was too small for larry to ride his horse through and he flung himself off and leaving his mount to his own devices he ran out into the street he saw no more than a car pull away from the kerb and move rapidly eastward he looked around for a cab but there was none in sight and with a shrug he came back found his horse mounted and trotted slowly back to where sir john was sitting where the devil did you go asked sir john i saw a gentleman i am most anxious to meet said larry a little breathlessly one blind jake who was taking his morning constitutional in the park with his car waiting to pick him up like a perfect gentleman if i had had a gun i would have given tarling another daffodil mystery to solve i should have been glad to find flowers for blind jake chapter xxxiii lew when he got back to the house diana was dressed and sitting down to breakfast i thought you weren t coming back she said with a little sigh why the sigh asked larry because i thought you weren t coming back to breakfast she said he told her of the chase in the park that rather upsets my theory that blind jake is still at the home or at the laundry she said because the house is being watched isn t it on both sides said larry but there are a dozen ways this fellow could get out and the fact that he goes for an early morning constitutional and the people who are behind him consider that his health is of sufficient importance to put a car at his disposal rather proves that he is confined during the day they were alone for the nurse chaperon had not finished dressing i don t know how this case is going to end diana said larry after a little silence and this is a most prosaic moment to say what i want to say but but but after this case is ended i don t want you to remain at the yard she went a little pale you mean i am not satisfactory she said as a secretary you re very satisfactory both as a secretary and an individual said larry trying hard to maintain command of his voice i don t like your i don t like your working there was another silence i don t think i shall work after this case she said quietly i thought of leaving too this was an unexpected reply and it filled him with a sense of panic you re not going away he asked and she laughed you re really a most inconsistent person you dismiss me in one breath and hope i m not leaving you in another she said and she was treading on dangerous ground and was well aware of the fact after all she went on solemnly mischievous there are so many jobs where competent girls are wanted i know a job where a competent girl is wanted said larry swallowing something and her job is to look after a flat and share the modest fortune of a detective inspector who may be something better one of these fine days she was helping herself to a triangular piece of toast when he spoke and she let the toast drop i don t quite know what you mean she faltered i mean said larry i want to marry you go to the devil she looked up open mouthed in time to see the door shut upon the outraged sunny i m awfully sorry stammered larry i didn t mean that last remark for you dear i really mean i know what you mean she said and laid her hand on his you mean you want me i want you so much said larry that i can t find words to make my want plain she did not speak she suffered her hand to stay under his and her eyes catching the distorted reflection of her face in the polished coffee pot she laughed larry drew his hand away quickly for he was a sensitive man i m rather a fool i m afraid he said quietly she had not moved put your hand back her voice was no higher than a whisper but he obeyed now tell me what you were saying i was laughing at myself in the coffee pot i don t look like a person that anybody could propose to at half past eight in the morning then then you know that you are being proposed to he said huskily she nodded and her shining eyes turned to meet his and will you he asked finding it difficult to frame the words will i what be proposed to she answered innocently i think i will larry dear i rather like it and then she was in his arms and he was holding her tightly tightly and then sunny came in and they did not see him he stole forth silently and made his way to the landing outside the door and rang the elevator bell the girl who worked the elevator was a great friend of his and supplied him with much information which was of value louie he said and he was more than usually sober can you tell me where i can get lodgings near at hand i think i shall soon be sleeping out sleeping out pat said the wondering louie she called him pat because it was his name but more because he had graciously permitted her that liberty is your master getting a housekeeper i think so said sunny very gravely indeed i think so louie larry may have walked to the office that morning or he may have ridden or floated he had no distinct recollection of what happened or how he got there except that he knew that diana ward was by his side and that he was hopelessly ridiculously overwhelmingly happy in his love it had been the most extraordinary courting and the proposal had been as amazingly unconventional he had pictured such a scene but it had been set in a quiet drawing room under shaded lights or in some bosky dell or in the shade of an old tree along some backwater of the ancient river not at breakfast he said aloud oh dear no not at breakfast repeated the girl oh you are thinking yes it was funny it was wonderful said larry i feel all puffed up then i m going to take some of the puffed up feeling out of you she said calmly i want you to make me a promise i ll promise you anything in the world diana he said extravagantly ask me for the top brick off the chimney pots or a slice of the moon nothing so difficult as that i merely want to and yet perhaps it will be more difficult she said seriously will you promise me that under no circumstances you will ask to be released from your engagement he turned round to her and almost stopped in his walk that s an easy one he said whatever makes you think i should want to break off this wonderful i know i know she interrupted it s very wonderful to me and yet she shook her head will you promise that whatever happens whatever be the outcome of the stuart case whether you fail or succeed whatever revelations come you will not break your engagement i promise you that said larry eagerly there s nothing in the world which would induce me to take back a word i ve said i am living in mortal terror lest you discover how you are throwing yourself away upon somebody who is not worthy of you if you do i swear i will sue you for breach of promise my fine feelings are not to be trifled with when they reached room they found two men waiting in the corridor one was a plain clothes officer the other was a wizened little man who sat pensively on a form his hands on his knees staring with unseeing eyes at the floor larry stopped at the sight what s this he asked oh i m sorry said the girl penitently i should have told you i sent for him why it s lew said larry in surprise and diana nodded you told me that i could call for any witness i wanted she began and he stopped her my dear of course you can he said he looked at the old man curiously and lew oblivious of all things sat in his dark and silent world consuming his own thoughts bring him in said larry how are you going to make him talk or convey our wishes to him he shook his head pityingly i never realized before what a terrible affliction this combination of circumstances might be he said can you talk to him i think so said the girl quietly but you must realize that he has no idea where he is for all he knows he may still be in that dreadful house of the blind still under the care of the men who have treated him so cruelly larry nodded when you said he was dead i thought you were mad he said but i understand now i want a shotgun said the girl and i want a uniformed officer she turned to larry i am going to see whether i have forgotten all i learnt in the blind hospital she said she took the old man by the hand and he followed her obediently she caught his two wrists gently and raised them to her face a woman he said then she took up the little vase of flowers on her desk and held them under his nose roses ain t they he said this is a hospital she beckoned the uniformed policeman who stood at the door and again raised the old man s hands letting them rest lightly on the collar of his tunic and his buttons then she raised them to his helmet a copper said lew and shrank back she gave him the flowers again and again raised his gnarled old hand and brought it to her cheek i m in a hospital and a policeman s looking after me am i wanted for anything she took his head between her hands and gently shook it i m not eh he said relieved larry was watching the play fascinated am i safe from them swine she took his head between her hands and forced him to nod do you want me to talk she repeated the movement and pushed a chair up to him guiding him down to it the plain clothes officer had brought the gun and she took it from him and lifting lew s hand passed it lightly over the barrel and the stock he shivered yes that s what they ve done to me he said you want them for that don t you it was cruel hard on a blind man what are you pinching my left hand for again she made him nod then she pinched the right hand and without waiting for his question made him shake his head i see i see he said eagerly the right hand is no and the left hand is yes is there somebody here high she signalled yes do they want me to tell again she signalled the affirmative and he began his story he and blind jake had been companions in misfortune he had been a slave to the big man almost since his youth and had lived a life of terror dominated by this extraordinary villain he done things that would make you curl up if you knew jake did nodded lew things that i don t like thinking about that haunt me at nights then five or six years before lew s own brother had joined this extraordinary band of criminals a fine big fellow he was too said lew proudly and he could see he used to go round the fairs pretending he couldn t but he had grand eyesight could read newspapers and books a big chap sir with long bushy whiskers down to here a grand fellow was jim but a hook then they had come under the influence of this extraordinary power to which blind jake was used to refer in reverent tones they had been sent to carry bodies from a house and jake had assisted and so had jim and lew he didn t know that they were murdered but he thought they were a clever gang they are why six years ago do you know what they did he seemed almost proud of the genius of these terrible men we chucked a man in the river with a weight round his legs you d think they d be suspicious wouldn t you when they found the body not they what do you think the weight was attached to guv nor a big block of salt that fitted just round the cove s legs and as soon as the salt dissolved up he came was he alive when you put him in asked larry and the girl shivered the man could not hear but he answered almost as though he could he may have been dead i forget lew went on he didn t holler or anything god s truth i didn t know they was going to put him in the water how was i to know but in the water he went and then jim disappeared i don t know what happened to him he just went away and we never saw him again that was four years ago in may as far as i can remember lew had got frightened after a while and began to suspect the danger to himself if he did not know it already and was fearful of jake and his threats more fearful of the mysterious vanishing of his brother he could not write braille but he had got a man in todd s home a straight un to write the message that he intended putting in the pocket of the next victim possibly he had heard from jake that there was a job at hand i think i will go now said the girl suddenly white larry took her out into the corridor and brought her a glass of water i m quite all right she smiled bravely go back and listen lew was talking when larry returned and when he had finished larry knew almost all there was to be known about the murder of gordon stuart that evening there was a conference of all heads of departments presided over by the chief commissioner we may not be able to convict on the evidence of this man said sir john gravely we will get the warrants if you like but i think with a little more rope and the knowledge we have we could catch them red handed larry came back to his office the girl had gone home in time to hear his telephone bell ringing is that mr holt said a strange voice now it is unusual to receive a call at scotland yard from anybody but police or public officials because the numbers of the various departments do not appear in the telephone book i am inspector holt replied larry dr judd asks you whether you can come to his office at once he has something important to communicate larry thought a moment yes i will come immediately he said he picked up harvey and a cab deposited them at bloomsbury pavement at this hour larry expected the building to be deserted but there was a light showing in one of the upstairs windows the long narrow vestibule was also illuminated larry walked quickly through the vestibule the porter s little recess was empty at the far end were the doors of two automatic lifts one of which was in position shall i come up with you asked the sergeant there was no reason why he shouldn t and yet no no stay here said larry he stepped into the lift and pushed the ivory button marked fourth floor and the elevator jerked upward at the fourth floor it stopped and larry pushing open the grille stepped out on to the landing immediately opposite him was a glass door behind which a light shone the words dr judd were written legibly enough and he turned the handle of the door and stepped into an empty room he called but nobody answered him and puzzled he came back to the landing every sense in larry holt s system was alert dr judd was not the kind of individual who would indulge in a silly practical joke or attempt to hoax him then he had a mild surprise he had come by the left hand elevator which had now disappeared and in its place was the right hand lift which must have been on a higher floor when he had reached the landing what was more remarkable the lift door was wide open who had come up he looked along the corridor but there was nobody in sight is everything all right it was the hollow voice of harvey coming up the elevator shaft i m coming down said larry and stepped through the open grille into the waiting elevator his foot was poised he was in the very act of bringing it down upon the floor of the lift when he realized in a flash that what he had thought was solid wood flooring was no more than paint and paper there was no possibility of drawing back his balance had shifted and the full weight of his body was thrown forward he had the fraction of a second to think and then utilizing every ounce of strength every atom of impetus he could get from his left foot which still rested on the solid edge of the landing he leapt forward and gripped the moulding of one of the panels at the back of the elevator he had less than half an inch to hold on by but by the extraordinary strength in his hands he maintained his hold even as his feet crashed through the paper flooring and the whole weight of his body was flung upon his finger tips he hung thus suspended in space a fifty foot fall upon the stone flags beneath him quick come up he shouted fourth floor i m trapped he heard the rattle of the other lift and the whine of the motor and at the same time he heard another sound above him and glancing up saw a face looking down from the opening on the fifth floor then something whizzed past him and struck the panelling of the elevator with a crash for a second he nearly released his hold he felt the lift shaking unaccountably and then to his horror the ascending lift passed him here here he shouted the face above seemed to be growing dimmer but again he saw the hand poised something struck him on the shoulder he released his hold and fell chapter xxxiv larry inspects a house larry jerked open the gates on the ground floor and staggered from the lift shaft to meet the dumbfounded dr judd standing in an attitude of surprise and incredulity expressed on every line of his countenance whatever has happened he demanded anxiously a miracle said larry with a touch of grimness i seem to have fallen about four feet you sent for me dr judd dr judd shook his head i m afraid i don t understand what this is all about he said will you come up to my office i don t think that is necessary said larry you sent a telephone message asking me to come here at once because you had something important to communicate to me i m going up he said viciously there s a gentleman on the top floor whose acquaintance i should like to make i assure you mr holt said the doctor earnestly that i have never sent for you or communicated with you in any way i sent my porter out on a message and then remembered that i hadn t any cigarettes and foolishly left this great building unattended you didn t step into the wrong lift did you a slow smile came to larry s face i rather fancy i did said he good heavens gasped the doctor why you might have been killed i don t exactly know what happened as it is said larry only one lift is working explained the doctor something went wrong with the motors and we re working them on balance that is to say one elevator comes down while the other goes up taking advantage of the fact that to morrow is sunday the workmen were repairing the floor of number two elevator which has worn rather thin and spread some pieces of paper and canvas in its place i presume said larry who was impolite and well aware of the fact anyway i m going up now he said and they went together in the sound elevator harvey was halfway down to his chief and they met him thank god you re not hurt he said larry shook his head i could have only been six feet from the ground when i dropped i didn t realize that this infernal elevator was descending all the time the gentleman was shying things at me somebody throwing at you sir i thought i heard a bit of iron strike the bottom of the shaft the elevator only went as far as the fourth floor the upper floor was reached by a stairway larry came up to the darkened landing to find as he had expected that his assailant had gone which way he had gone there was no need to ask for in the ceiling at the end of the passage was a square patch of light where a trap door had been raised and beneath there was a pair of steps i can t tell you how sorry i am said dr judd when they rejoined him he looked unusually pale and his voice quavered some fool must have played a practical joke which might have had very serious consequences how did you save yourself but larry was in no mood for narrative and he left a perturbed dr judd with a curt good night and to morrow harvey said larry i shall be at the office at half past nine and i want you to be there to meet me the clearing up process begins in earnest to morrow and this day week please god there will be no stuart mystery my dear said larry holt at breakfast the next morning and his tone was at once paternal and apprehensive i said one large prayer last night and it was one of thankfulness that your prophecy is coming true about capturing the gang she asked something like that said he rising are you going without me she asked in surprise as he rose from the table yes he hesitated i am going to pursue a little clue which may be a very big clue indeed she looked at him doubtfully i couldn t come with you i suppose she asked he shook his head no this is a job which i must do entirely on my own he said anyway it is necessary that i should break the law to make my investigations and i cannot be responsible for leading you from the straight path i don t think it would worry me very much she smiled but you don t want to tell me that s it isn t it you ve guessed it first time said larry the noble sunny will look after you and escort you to scotland yard and he will be bulging with weapons of a lethal character sunny blushed but recovered immediately yes sir said he i m thinking of sending your overcoat to be cleaned for the winter what on earth has that to do with escorting miss ward to scotland yard asked larry in astonishment nothing sir said sunny except it will be very cold round about november and they take a long time to clean overcoats in fact said the girl with a smile sunny is being nicely domestic and is taking a very optimistic view of the outcome of this case where will this clue lead you she asked i d rather like to know because she stopped well in case you are ever missing it is leading me to hampstead said larry she drew a deep sigh i was dreadfully afraid it was somewhere else she said he wondered why she was afraid but it was not a subject that he wished to pursue because he had lied outrageously half an hour after he reached the yard two slightly soiled men in the shabby uniform of the north metropolitan gas company walked out the whitehall end of scotland yard one carrying a bag of tools and boarded a bus they were set down within a quarter of a mile of their destination and walked the remainder of the journey stopping to survey the house wherein larry had decided would be found the solution of gordon stuart s death it was an unusual looking house bare and grim with few windows and those heavily barred the man who planned that must have thought he was designing a prison sir said harvey maybe he was replied larry harvey if what lew the blind man told us is true then we have come to the end of the chase harvey was shocked but this is only a look over sir he said you don t really expect to finish the case on this one inspection larry nodded when i enter that house i am pulling into material shape every dream i have dreamt every theory i have evolved i stand or fall by the result does miss ward know began harvey boldly this is the one thing that miss ward doesn t know smiled larry crossing the road he mounted the steps and rang the bell the door was opened by a manservant and to him larry holt spoke shortly and with authority and they were ushered into the hall remember you are to keep our visit a secret said larry you can depend on me mr holt said the man who had turned a sickly green at the detective s appearance the hall was wide and lofty panelled in oak from the tessellated marble floor to the ceiling the only furniture was a table and a chair larry noted there were no lights visible and he gathered that illumination was furnished by lamps concealed in the cornices other illuminations were furnished by a long narrow window of frosted glass through which the shadow of the bars could be seen there was no stairway leading from the hall but there was a doorway immediately facing the street door which larry guessed concealed the staircase on the other side of the hall was a second door and these were the only apparent means of egress from the passage he opened the door on the right and found himself in a large and beautifully furnished salon the walls were hung about with pictures and tapestries and on the polished floor were half a dozen persian rugs which larry could see were worth a fortune there were six stained glass windows in this room and each was a masterpiece by their side hung heavy velvet curtains which could be so drawn that the window excluded all light one silver electrolier hung in the middle of the apartment and there were no other lights though here again larry supposed that the main illumination came from concealed lamps he walked across to the big fireplace with its silver grate and fixtures and examined two letters which lay open upon a table by the side of the big armchair they were of no importance and he continued his search from the main apartment another door opened on to a flight of stairs which led to a suite of bedrooms a little drawing room and a large study which was over the salon and covered practically the same area his search upstairs was more or less perfunctory though his examination of the corridor from whence the bedrooms gave was of a more careful and exacting character but he came down again to the salon satisfied in his mind that what had to be discovered was to be looked for on the lower floor he found the servant in the room when he came down and dismissed him sharply go back to the hall he said and sulkily the man obeyed and now larry gave every minute to an examination of the panelled walls of the room particularly that wall which was opposite the door through which he and harvey had entered so cunningly had the panelling been arranged that it was a long time before he found the concealed door and then it was not where he had been looking but on a level with the stained glass window he remembered then having seen from the outside a small semicircular obtrusion from the main wall of the building here we are harvey he said exultantly as he pulled up a carved wreath which seemed to be part of the wall s decorations and disclosed a tiny keyhole he took the packet of keys from his pocket and tried first one and then the other at the fourth trial a lock slipped back and the door opened inwards he was right he knew it at that moment the joy of accomplishment set his heart beating faster the knowledge that he had at last a tangible something to show not to the commissioner not to his superiors but to the girl who was more to him than career or life brought a new colour to his cheeks and a brighter light to his eyes he was in a small bell shaped apartment with a domed roof a room so small that the door when it was opened touched the opposite wall it was made of concrete and a flight of steps leading down to the cellar were also of this material the first thing that caught his eye was an electric switch and this he snapped down illuminating a lower landing there was another door to the left and a further flight of steps which disappeared in darkness no effort had been made to conceal the keyhole of the door and one of his keys opened it he found himself in a low roofed concrete chamber about five foot six in height and as near as he could judge about ten feet square he searched for and found the electric switch and illuminated the apartment what do you think of this harvey what are they running asked harvey in surprise an electric light plant larry shook his head no he said this isn t a light plant i know very little about machinery but i have an idea that this gadget is a pump he examined the machinery more carefully yes it is a pump he said one of the type which is used in ships to trim the ballast tanks a thick cable was suspended on brackets along the wall and he felt this gingerly electric he said this is where he gets his power on the wall was a switchboard and what seemed an independent lever he examined this closely and before he went on to yet another machine and this is the ventilating plant he said pointing to a barrel shaped instrument you notice the bad air exhaust he s a thorough gentleman this said sergeant harvey very agreed larry and they walked out of the room locking the door behind them a door over there leading to the yard said larry pointing to the wall opposite the machine room harvey saw no door but followed his leader down a further flight of stairs ten steps larry warned and then he came against a door a heavy door of ferro concrete hung upon hinges of toughened bronze this larry confirmed before he went any farther he expected to find bronze and would have been surprised if the hinges had been made of any other material he had two fears one that the doors would be fitted with bolts and the other that they were impossible to open from the inside this latter fear he saw was groundless for the keyhole was covered from the outside by a screw cap he twisted the cover off and opened the door it swung back heavily and he measured the edge four inches thick he said grimly he takes no chances behind the first door was another of steel and this too he unlocked and now he paused and he felt his breath grow laboured take note of this room to which we are coming said larry holt for it was here that gordon stuart died chapter xxxv the death room he carried a flash lamp in his hand but it was some time before he discovered the switch which was set high in the wall near the sloping roof of the stairs on the farthermost side of the door a click and the void before them was illuminated he could see nothing from where he stood save a brass bedstead destitute of clothing down two steps and three paces along a narrow passage and he was in the room floor roof and walls were of cement work and he saw that what he had thought was one was really two rooms the second being fitted up roughly as a bathroom there were no windows of any kind and he had not expected them the air was heavy and stale and evidently the two ventilators near the ceiling were not in working order but it was not the bathroom nor the bedstead to which his eyes strayed it was to a great block of granite in the centre of the room in the stone which was a cube two feet in each direction was a large steel bolt and from this bolt ran a thin rusted chain also of steel each yard of the chain ran through a block of lead which larry judged to be ten pounds in weight and there were three of these the chain terminated in a brass leg ring yes said larry i think so he picked up the ring and examined it and trying first one and then the other of his keys upon the little lock the opening of which was protected by a sliding cover presently he saw the two catches snap back and heaved a sigh thank god for that he said i was afraid i d missed the key he looked round at harvey and harvey s face was a study what is this mr holt he asked bewildered the operating room of the dark eyes replied larry briefly do you mean to say that these devils larry nodded he was walking around the walls looking for a place where he could conceal the waterproof bag he carried in his pocket there was not so much as a crack into which it could be hidden for the big holes set in the wall near the floor at regular intervals were he knew of no value for his purpose then his eye fell upon the granite block and exerting all his strength he pulled at it slowly it canted away there had been no necessity to cement to the floor a block of that weight give me a hand to ease this down harvey he said and the two men lowered the block on its side it had fitted truly and its base was perhaps only an inch deeper than the floor where it had stood the workmen had not taken the trouble to make its foundations secure and there was a depression in the cement irregular and shallow but large enough for larry s purpose he took the waterproof bag it was no more than a sponge bag from his pocket and began to drop various articles into the bottom key followed key and then a handcuff key if you ve got one harvey he said i left mine in my room harvey found a handcuff key in his waistcoat pocket and passed it across to his superior and this i think said larry and took something from his pocket and placed it in the bag he smoothed the bag and its contents as flat as possible and it just fitted into the depression then the two men lifted the stone and put it back in its place may i ask said the bewildered harvey what is the idea larry laughed and his laugh sounded hollow in that dreadful room which had never heard laughter is the servant in this asked harvey i m perfectly sure he isn t this gang wouldn t trust a servant replied larry no he probably keeps to his own part of the house and doesn t even enter the reception room except when his boss is at home unless he is sent for if you notice this house it has been built for a specific purpose for example the room has a vacuum bracket in the wainscot there is an electric lift from the kitchen and a private stairway to the bedrooms and study upstairs my theory is but i haven t time to confirm it that the servant lives in practically a house of his own which has no connection with this part of the building did you notice a door opposite what i would call the engine room it wasn t easy to spot because it looked like the rest of the wall in reality it is of iron camouflaged as concrete it is on the ground level and leads to the yard at the side of the house and incidentally to the garage harvey shouldered his tools this is a horrible place mr holt he said with a shudder in all my thirty five years of police experience i have never been so shocked it sounds silly to you not a bit said larry quietly i am shocked beyond words you really think that that is the place where these people have been done to death i m certain of it said larry in that room gordon stuart went over to the other side they went back in the hall now by the side of the door there was a narrow slit of a window covered by a strip of silk casement cloth and harvey went to this and pulled it aside there s a car at the door he said just come up larry stepped to his side and looked a man had descended from a taxicab and was paying the driver the reverend mr dearborn said larry how interesting larry hesitated only for a second then he opened the door and the rev john dearborn who had turned from the cab and whose hand was on the spikes of the gate bent his head suddenly as though he had remembered something and beckoned the cabman my friend he said i cannot see you but are you still there yes sir replied the cabman i have remembered that i wish to call at the post office will you take me there his hand groped out and the cabman took it and leaning back opened the door again before larry could get down the steps the cab was on the move the detective turned back with a little smile david judd can wait he said softly david judd said harvey david judd repeated larry holt who said this is not an age of miracles when the blind can see as john dearborn sees and david judd dead and buried is rollicking round london in a taxicab harvey there s a great detective in this city there is sir said sergeant harvey heartily and the name of the same is holt it isn t but it will be said larry softly chapter xxxvi the woman in the garage wait said larry he was on the point of leaving the house of death we may not get another opportunity of making a leisurely examination of these premises i am curious about the side door he led the way to the secret door in the salon closing it behind him then down the steps he passed and paused opposite the engine room here is the door to the yard i think he said and switched his flash lamp over the wall the keyhole was difficult to find but he discovered it after a while near the floor in the bottom right hand corner as he had expected it opened on to a covered passageway from the road clever work he said in honest admiration he was in the yard looking at the wall through which he had come nothing like a door was visible instead he looked upon something which had the appearance of a window made up of four opaque panes it stood out from the wall in the most natural fashion a trim window box filled with flowers on its ledge not much like a door said larry and added clever work he walked back to the gate and examined it closely then he returned to harvey the mystery of the automatic gate is solved he said as i suspected it is possible to reach the house and enter the yard and garage without the servants knowing anything at all about it the last time i was here i noticed what looked to be two peep holes placed at a distance of four feet apart and rather low they couldn t have been intended for purposes of observation because they were backed with iron did you notice anything about that car we saw in the laundry garage yes sir said harvey there were two bars sticking out in front under the head lamps and larry nodded i thought at first he said that it was some new kind of motor car invention but it is clear now just what they are intended for a car is driven up to the gate and those two bars fit in what i called the peep holes a lock is pressed back and the door opens and presumably closes behind them thus dispensing with the attendance of any servants and avoiding the inconvenience of their coming and going being noted by the people in the house i think we will look at the garage and then we will go he said the door of the garage was at the far end of the drive and extended across its whole width larry searched amongst his keys and presently he found what he was looking for i wondered what door this tumbler lock was on he said he slipped the key in the hole and turned it and as he did so he heard a slight movement within the garage did you hear that he said in a whisper harvey nodded and drew his truncheon then suddenly larry threw open the gates wide he saw a car but apparently the garage was empty of people the wheels of the car were wet that came in this morning said larry there was no place where the smallest of men could conceal himself he thought and then he heard a scream shrill and painful the scream of someone in agony and he sprang to the door of the big limousine and pulled it open then a tornado loosed itself at him a great gibbering shape leapt at the two men and by sheer weight flung them down dropping his huge mass upon them larry was stunned for a second and then as he struggled to his feet he heard the door of the garage slammed and the click of the lock as the key was turned the two men threw themselves at the door but it did not give an inch the woman cried harvey suddenly and pointed to the car there was an inert heap lying there and larry leapt on to the step and lifting her out in his arms carried her to where a ray of light penetrated from the small roof window it was a woman of fifty gray and bedraggled her face had not known soap or water for weeks her hands were almost black but now through the grime her white face showed in a deathly grin and the claw marks of blind jake stood out in purple relief upon her lean throat get some water harvey there s a faucet there said larry loosening the woman s blouse she s alive he said and then he realized my god he said in a low voice it is the charwoman whilst he attended to the poor wretched creature harvey had searched the garage and had discovered an axe in five minutes the lock was smashed and the door was open take this gun said larry slipping his revolver from his pocket it hasn t been much use to me but if you see that swine shoot him don t argue with him or think you can stop him with your truncheon harvey but blind jake had gone as he knew that blind man with the most precious of his faculties destroyed had again been a match for him the woman was showing some signs of a return to life larry had dragged her into the air and was sprinkling water on her neck and face her eyes fluttered and opened and she looked up with a frown where is miss clarissa she asked thickly that is what i am going to ask you said larry the cab came soon after and they carried the woman through the side door up the steps and through the beautiful salon they paused to set her down in the reception room and larry looked round at the evidence of comfort and luxury bought with the suffering and misery of god knows how many innocent souls who had died that this villainy should be gilded and scented and live in fragrance then his eyes dropped upon the incongruous figure that lay on a thousand pound persian rug who had done no harm but know and recognize stuart and must for that reason be condemned to hide in dark places under the care of a fiend like blind jake strauss the ex convict butler waited in the hall nervously rubbing his hands you re not in this are you asked larry no sir said the man shakily i thought when you came that my gentleman had sent you because i had found a few things like a black enamelled link eh said larry how many pairs did he have of those two pairs sir i had to tell him when he asked me what had become of them because really i did not steal them he had half given them to me because three of the brilliants were missing don t worry strauss said larry he has got them back now though he had to burgle a pawnbroker s to get them a knot of idlers gathered on the pavement to watch the spectacle of two apparently officials of a gas company carry an unsavoury woman who looked seventy down the steps into the cab she had recovered consciousness before the cab had gone far and was trembling violently looking from one to the other of the men you re all right now emma said larry kindly emma she repeated do you know me sir yes i know you said larry then i m safe she said eagerly oh thank god for that you don t know what i ve been through you don t know what i ve been through i can guess said larry where are you taking her asked harvey in a low voice i didn t hear what you told the cabman i am taking her to my flat said larry and sergeant harvey looked his surprise i can t afford to fill the hospitals with the witnesses for the crime said larry with a faint smile and besides this woman is not ill she s just tired and hungry that s right said emma eagerly i know i must look terrible but they never gave me a chance of washing myself they dragged me from one hole to another i m not a common woman sir although i ve done charwoman s work i was nursemaid and brought up a little girl sir the daughter of my missis brought her up like a lady sir little clarissa stuart clarissa stuart i called her clarissa sir said emma if i could only see her again you called her clarissa said larry slowly was not that her name yes sir said the woman clarissa diana but i used to call her diana larry started back as though he had been shot what is your name he asked in a husky voice emma ward sir diana ward i called the young lady but diana stuart is her real name and her father is in london diana stuart repeated larry slowly then diana stuart is the heiress to whom stuart left his money diana stuart he repeated in a tone of wonder my diana chapter xxxvii the heiress mrs emma ward had told him practically all there was to tell about herself before the cab had drawn up at the entrance of the flat it was she who had failed to register the birth of diana and her twin sister and this failure had curiously enough saved her life for when the gang had discovered as they did a few hours earlier than larry that gordon stuart had left an enormous fortune to the daughter whose existence he had discovered through an accidental meeting with the charwoman at nottingham place they lost no time in securing the one witness who could prove the legality and the circumstances of diana s birth never had larry so congratulated himself upon any event as he did upon the fact that he had engaged a chaperon for diana once before had that nurse been useful and now she took charge of the unhappy woman who to the scandal of the neighbourhood he brought to his flat and it was a presentable and tidy lady of middle age who came into his sitting room an hour after her arrival within reach of hot water and clean towels i am going now to see miss he baulked at the word miss stuart he said the woman started do you know where she is oh yes said larry i know she has been with me for he was on the point of saying years and honestly believing the word he framed and then with a queer sense of surprise he realized that weeks and very few weeks at that would most accurately describe the length of his friendship with miss diana ward he had thought of telephoning the news to her but somehow he wanted to tell her himself and there were other things he had to say things which were hard to think about he thought it all over on the way to the yard diana ward poor and dependent was a different girl from clarissa stuart an heiress to millions of dollars he could ask diana ward to marry him and look forward with happiness to a union where each brought to the other only the treasure of love diana stuart was a rich woman he did not doubt that she would be sweet and generous and desirous that the marriage should go through but after a time she would realize how enormous were the possibilities which great possessions offer and then she would regret in a nice way he told himself for he defended her even as he accused her and that was the end of the case he thought kudos would come to him though he could take no credit for that and the long deferred promotion that also would come and he would sit in the office an assistant commissioner and exercise his function but all the success he had secured was diana s hers was the brain that had disentangled the knottiest of the problems and had made the tangle of clues into one straight case it was curious that he did not also credit her with having discovered even more perhaps it was the natural vanity which is latent in all men which made him guard so jealously the claim to one achievement the discovery of her identity the end of the case and the end of all hope for him as he knew there was never another woman in the world like diana ward she was the first in his heart and should be the last he had renounced her in his mind and had drawn a gray veil over the future by the time he stood outside room with his hand upon the door knob hardly daring to turn it because of the loss which would be his and his first words expressed aloud the thought that followed that moment of hesitation diana he said i am the most selfish brute in the world she showed all her white teeth in a silent laugh i waited for you for over an hour she said good lord he gasped i was taking you to lunch yes she nodded that was what you were talking about he shook his head i wish to heaven it was he said there i am again thinking of myself and being sorry for myself when i ought to be on my knees thanking heaven for the good fortune which has come to you she jumped up you have found emma she said i have found emma ward he replied slowly and i have found clarissa stuart he walked toward her both hands outstretched oh my dear my dear he said i am so glad for you she took the hands in hers and lifted one to her cheek aren t you glad for yourself too he was silent and she looked at him quickly larry she said i have known all about this for days and days ever since the day i fainted at that boarding house in nottingham place don t you remember he frowned of course but why why you silly she said i knew it was aunt emma s ring i always called her aunt though i knew she was not my aunt and then i guessed who gordon stuart was i knew nothing would make her leave her wedding ring behind do you know where she went in such a hurry he shook his head to find me she said simply i guessed that i knew it instinctively before i had heard of that ring my father gave it to her she used to tell me how she was married when she was in my father s service and how my father presented her with this strange wedding ring for all she had done for my mother you knew he said wonderingly but you never told me you went on a chase to day she lifted her finger reproachfully and shook it in his face and you never told me you said you were going to hampstead and you went to chelsea you knew that too he gasped do i get any credit out of this infernal this case he corrected quickly you get me she said demurely he pressed her hands together diana i ve got a serious talk coming with you and it s about i know what it s all about she said you can save yourself the trouble you can t marry a rich woman because you re afraid she ll want to keep you you would much rather marry a poor woman and keep her if she would submit to that indignity there was fun in the eyes that were raised to his larry she shook his hands with quiet impatience it makes a difference doesn t it he asked not to me larry she replied and anyway it doesn t matter she dropped his hands and walked back to her table because you ve promised promised what have i promised hear this man she scoffed you promised me that whatever happened whatever was the outcome of the stuart case it would make no difference to our marriage did you know he asked in astonishment was that why you made me promise of course i knew i ve been a rich woman for quite a long time and i m so used to the feeling that i can hardly restrain myself from taking a cab whenever i see one he walked over to her and laid his arm about her shoulder diana he began and then asked or is it clarissa diana always she said he kissed her and always chapter xxxviii the end of jake the man who called himself the rev john dearborn sat behind the locked door of his study and methodically burnt papers in a little fireplace that was at the back of his chair his blue glasses he had dispensed with and under his eyes keen and alert the heap of manuscripts old letters receipts and other data were sorted and melted away until there was only a package left small enough to go into his pocket he slipped a rubber band round these and put them on one side then he took up a heavy wad of manuscripts and dropped it into an open bag which was beside his desk and as he sorted and read and destroyed he whistled a little tune thoughtfully from one of the drawers in the desk he took out a thicker package of manuscript bound in a stiff cover he turned the leaves of this idly and sometimes the excellence of the writing induced him to read on and on that s damned good he said not once but many times for john dearborn was a great admirer of the genius of john dearborn at last with an air of reluctance he closed the manuscript volume and put that more reverently in the bag the house was empty for the hawkers had not begun to stray back and except for the little man who acted as doorkeeper and kept the home swept and garnished and the old cook who was dozing in her kitchen the home was deserted presently he finished his packing and patted first one breast pocket and then the other until he found the letter he wanted he took it out and studied it for a while it was a brief hand written note which larry holt had written to him the day after his first visit to todd s home he took up his pen and with one eye on the copy he fashioned a word taken from the letter and compared the two efforts then from the open writing case which lay on the desk he extracted a sheet of headed notepaper and began to write slowly and laboriously and all the time he wrote he whistled his gay little tune he finished at last and addressed an envelope also taken from the writing case and when this was blotted and the letter sealed and put into his pocket he strapped the case and placed it on the floor by the side of his bag then he unlocked a wardrobe let into the wall and took out some clothing which he laid on the back of a chair and now he was singing with soft diminuendo yet with evident enjoyment one of the indian love lyrics he stripped his sombre clerical garb tore away his white choker collar and began to dress he was a man about town now in smartly tailored tweeds and he put the clerical costume into the wardrobe and shut the door then he sat down at the table his face in his hands thinking thinking he had dressed almost mechanically and he had a strange feeling of dissatisfaction all the exits would be guarded even the panel the roof path the way through the boiler room i m mad he said getting up he looked down at the bag and the writing case and there was regret in his expression he peeled his coat and slowly undressed again this time he did not go to the wardrobe but to a long black box under the window and he took out various articles of attire and viewed them with distaste a wretched mountebank he called himself and was genuinely contemptuous but it had to be this or nothing blind jake could find his way by the underground channel he had the sharp instincts of the blind could walk like a cat past the sentinels and even creep through narrow passages where it seemed impossible that his big frame could go john dearborn dressed and took up a canvas bag from the box laying it on the table he turned the contents of his leather grip into this bag then went to the front room of the home and looked out into the street two policemen he knew were guarding the end of the cul de sac nobody used this front room except himself for storing odds and ends of furniture old account books and the like but it had the advantage of possessing a door which was only a few feet from the front door he put down his sack and came out closing the door carefully before he went back to his study and locked himself in he sat there for ten minutes waiting and then came a gentle tap tap on the panel he crossed the room noiselessly opened the door just wide enough for the caller to slip through it was blind jake and his face was strained and puffed and on his broad forehead the blue veins stood out i only just got here governor he said breathlessly the other was eyeing him with a steely look what are you doing here jake he asked softly i told you not to leave the woman under any circumstances until i came well you didn t come master said the blind man it was pathetic to hear the pleading the humility in his tone his blind eyes were fixed on the cold man whom he loved so well and had served as men serve fate a great rough cruel hound of a man strong enough to crush and maim the master he worshipped yet ready to cringe and whine at a sharp word blind jake had given all for john dearborn had been the readiest minister of his vengeance and the slave of his cupidity blood was on his hands and there were nights when strange faceless shapes came in and out of his room and were visible cold hands touched him on these nights cold stiff fingers felt for his throat and he could feel the rough wipings of sodden sleeves and the drip drip drip of water but none of these things mattered the sweat poured down his puckered face his big lips were dropping and perhaps the blind man felt some thrill in the atmosphere for he asked with a little whine is there anything wrong governor where is the woman asked mr dearborn and his words dropped one by one like steel pellets blind jake shifted uneasily on his seat i left her i couldn t do you left her another tremendous pause and they found her eh john dearborn s voice had grown very soft yes they found her said the man what could i do governor i d have done anything for you haven t i used my strength for you master there s no one as strong in the world as me old blind jake there s no one who can work as cunning as i can haven t i worked for ye haven t i carried em out for ye haven t i croaked em for ye with these hands master he held them out great cruel hands knotted and roughened their backs speckled brown their palms yellow with callosities you lost holt said dearborn calmly dispassionately as a judge might speak you lost that woman you lost the girl and you come and talk to me of what you have done i ve done my best said the man humbly and they ll catch you too and you can talk i ll have my tongue torn out before i talk against you said blind jake violently and smashed his fist down on the table so that it cracked and quivered you know that i d die for you master yes said dearborn he slipped his hand the left hand that had no little finger under his coat and pulled out a short ugly automatic pistol of heavy calibre you ll talk he said you re bound to talk jake the man leant forward his big face working convulsively if i die he began and then john dearborn taking deliberate aim fired three shots and that great mountain of muscle swayed and slipped by the table into a heap on the ground blind jake s day had come chapter xxxix the get away dearborn slipped the revolver in his pocket unlocked the door and stepped out the little man who acted as porter was standing his mouth agape what s wrong he said quickly who s shooting go out and fetch the police said john dearborn calmly somebody has been killed oh my heaven whispered the little man there are two policemen at the end of the road hurry said john dearborn sharply and listened to the flip flap of the messenger s slippers as he shuffled up the street dearborn waited awhile then entered the front room and closed the door standing against it listening he heard the rush of feet distinguished the policemen heard them clump through the passage and the chatter of an idle bystander or two behind them then he opened the door a policeman was bending over blind jake that s him all right he said jim clear these people out and stand on duty at the door until the inspector comes you d better blow your whistle a police whistle shrilled through lissom lane and the little knot of curiosity mongers who had been turned unceremoniously from the scene of the tragedy grouped about the door what s happened asked mr dearborn and the policeman smiled good naturedly now postman he said you go along and deliver your letters and john dearborn flung his bag over his shoulder for he had chosen the uniform of a letter carrier and it had proved a most effective cloak he got away within a few minutes of larry s arrival the detective was on his way to interview mr john dearborn and the handcuffs he had in his pocket were expressly intended for that gentleman larry saw the little crowd about the door and knew that something unusual had happened he came to the study and looked silently upon the massive body of his enemy blind jake had died immediately he had never known what had struck him or guessed the vile treachery of the employer he had served so well the man must be in the house somewhere sir said the policeman this little fellow heard the shots and the superintendent sent him out to get a policeman we both came down together me and my mate was the front door left unguarded at all asked larry only for a second sir said the policeman we both came in together that was the second our friend got away said larry i don t think it s any use searching the house he was accompanied by the officers who had been charged to effect the arrest of dearborn and their inspection and examination of the room produced nothing of importance larry drove back to the yard and interviewed the chief commissioner then he went to the girl i ve heard the news she said quietly sergeant harvey has just been in do you think dearborn s killed him dearborn is david judd said larry dr judd s brother she said in surprise but he s dead he shook his head that elaborate funeral was well staged and i am perfectly certain that david even went to the length of providing the body he is a very thorough gentleman you remember lew telling us of his brother who disappeared a fine looking fellow with a beard she nodded that is the man we shall find in david judd s grave he said is dr judd she began and there was no need to finish the sentence dr judd is in it up to the neck said larry the story of dearborn is explained very easily dearborn was a partner of judd s and something that happened at the office either some crime or some murder perhaps which david had man uvred in order to draw insurance had come to the knowledge of one of the clerks this man stole a large sum of money and went to montpellier and from there began to blackmail david david went after him and shot him probably the murder was unpremeditated because david is not the sort of man who would shoot in the open square but at any rate he did shoot and he was seen by flash fred who reached the body in time to learn from the dying man the name of his murderer to a man of fred s calibre that meant that he had an income for life and he hastened back to london saw dr judd and probably stated the terms on which he would keep his mouth shut judd decided that david should conveniently die and david you remember was a fine looking man with a beard of their hirelings or acquaintances they chose lew s brother as being the nearest in physical appearance to david and he was unceremoniously destroyed and buried as david incidentally a very large sum of money was drawn from the underwriters on the heavy insurance policy which had been issued to david they must have had this scheme in mind for some time for a month before david s death dr judd had completed the purchase of todd s home it was not so much a charitable institution as a business proposition for todd s home had deteriorated into a kind of superior doss house frequented by the lowest of the low amongst the blind mendicants of london it was there that the famous dark eyes had their headquarters and it was from them that david must have learnt of todd s the home was bought and the day after david s death the rev john dearborn appeared as the new superintendent it is perfectly true that he cleared out all the bad characters and had certain structural alterations made but he only did this because he wanted to clear the taint from todd s home to give it a good character and to employ the house as his headquarters without fear of police visitations when the laundry company went broke it was judd who bought the premises and the alterations were carried out by david himself with the assistance of his gang david i might remark is an architect and built the house in which his brother lives we know they employed foreign workmen and that that house was built for one specific purpose he said gravely with the laundry premises in their possession the dark eyes came back to lissom lane and came and went amongst the blind who could not see them and who were ignorant of their presence what about dr judd she asked i am arresting him said larry and i am arresting him in the very place from whence your father disappeared in that famous box a at the macready theatre will he be there she asked in surprise he nodded he is there almost every evening he said quietly but why not take him now she asked puzzled because box a and its mystery have yet to be cleared up said larry and i have an idea that i shall clear it at eight o clock that night he walked into the vestibule of the macready theatre dr judd sir said the attendant yes he s in box a is he expecting you larry nodded harvey was for accompanying him but the other shook his head i ll go alone said larry he went swiftly down the passage and stopping only for a second outside box a he turned the knob of the door and stepped in dr judd s eyes were fixed on the stage and the detective had stopped to speak to him when something dropped on his head something fleecy and warm it felt like a bag lined with wool it had been saturated with a chemical which took his breath away and momentarily paralyzed him then he felt a string pulled tightly round his neck and whipped out his pistol before he could use it it was gripped something sharp hit the hand that held it and he let go with a cry of pain muffled in the bag every breath he took choked him he struck out but his arms were seized from behind and he was flung forward on the floor dimly he heard the voice of dearborn the atomizer peter a nozzle was pressed under his chin into the bag and something pungent was sprayed under his nostrils he tried to fight his way out of their grip but a knee was in the middle of his back and then he lost consciousness you re really a genius david said dr judd almost ecstatically so perfectly timed so beautifully done wonderful dear fellow wonderful open the door and look out peter said david and the doctor obeyed the passage was empty immediately opposite the door of box a a curtain was draped on the wall and through this he disappeared and there came a rush of cold air as he opened the fire exit door which led to the side street where a car was waiting a minute later david judd had picked up the detective as easily as though he were a child had lifted him into the interior of the limousine and had taken the place at the wheel he came to the house in chelsea and brought the car with a sweep straight to the closed gates of the covered driveway in that solid gate were the two big circles and before david judd s car were two steel bars that projected beyond the line of the lamps and just beneath slowly and skilfully he brought the car up the inclined slope from the roadway so that the ends of the two bars rested in the peep holes then he drove the machine forward there was a click and the gates swung open the car rolled in and as the wheels passed over a narrow transverse platform that gave slightly under its weight the doors closed again david judd stopped opposite the door that looked like a window opened it and lifting larry in his arms passed inside the lights were burning on the stairs leading to the cell the doors of which were wide open he threw the detective on the bed picked up the bronze anklet and snapped it about one of larry s ankles and then and only then did he pull off the heavy leather bag which covered larry holt s head it stank of formalhyadine and he threw it into the bathroom larry s face was purple he had all the symptoms of one who had been strangled but as the night air reached him he gasped david leant over and felt his pulse opened his eyelids and smiled he went out softly locking the two doors and paused at the first landing to enter what sergeant harvey had called the machinery room he turned over a switch and the electric ventilating apparatus hummed drowsily david went again into the yard stopping only to lock the doors behind him he had no time to lose the engines of his car were still running and he jumped into his seat and began to go slowly backward as the wheels reached the narrow weighbridge the gates opened again they would remain open twenty seconds and would then close of themselves and the car had hardly backed on to the road before they came together noiselessly swiftly the car sped back this time it turned northward and jolted to a standstill opposite larry holt s flat chapter xl a letter from larry diana had gone home it was queer how in a few days she had come to regard larry s flat as her home before dinner her work was done and there remained only the stern grim processes of arrest to be accomplished at any moment she expected the telephone bell to ring and to hear larry s voice telling her that the brothers were under lock and key she had a book on her lap but she was not reading her nurse and chaperon was sewing in her room sunny was standing outside the door of the flat which was ajar discussing certain matters with louie the lift girl in a low voice probably sunny had secrets of his own but it was certain that the discovery of a person who agreed with him in most of the things he said and most of the statements he made had fascinated this agreeable man diana sat her head bent her hand softly caressing her throat and her mind was on the future rather than upon the tragic past she rose once and went into sunny s little room where the woman she had called aunt was sleeping peacefully and she smiled as she walked back along the passage at the thought of this female invasion of larry s bachelor quarters she had taken up the book when sunny knocked and came in there s a note for you miss he said and handed a letter to the girl it was in larry s writing and she tore open the envelope and read dear diana the most extraordinary mistake has occurred dr judd has given an amazing version of the death of your father will you get into the car which i have sent and come down to his house at once endman gardens chelsea larry she glanced at the embossed note heading larry had written from endman gardens is there any answer miss yes said the girl tell the chauffeur i will come down at once are you going out miss said sunny dubiously yes i am going to mr holt she said with a smile would you like me to come with you miss said sunny the master doesn t wish you to go about alone i think i m all right this evening sunny said the girl kindly thank you very much for your offer she dressed quickly and went downstairs the limousine was waiting at the door and the chauffeur touched his cap miss ward he asked i m from the doctor s he spoke in a gruff voice as if he had a cold i am miss ward she replied and sprang into the limousine the car stopped before a dark and silent house is this the place she asked yes miss said the man if you go up those steps and ring the bell the servant will take you to the gentlemen it was dr judd himself jovial and smiling who opened the door to her and ushered her into a magnificent room you don t mind waiting here a little while miss stuart he said the name sounded oddly to her and he laughed i suppose you re not used to being called that name eh he said with excellent humour now i m going upstairs to see our mutual friend and i will bring him down to you perhaps you could amuse yourself for ten minutes our little conference is not quite ended she nodded and settled herself in the chair the ten minutes passed and twenty minutes and the twenty minutes became forty minutes and nobody came to her the silver toned clock on the mantelpiece chimed sweetly ten o clock she said in surprise i wonder what is keeping him yet she had no fear and did not doubt for one moment that larry was in the house the room was luxurious beautiful more beautiful than any diana had ever seen she sat by the side of a great open fireplace where a small fire was burning for the night was chilly and she looked round approvingly upon the pictures the tapestries the rich hangings and the soft panelling which was the background for all there was not an article of furniture in that room she thought that had not been chosen with care and judgment the rugs upon the floor were antique persian the carved table might have been looted from an eastern emperor s palace she lay luxuriously in the depths of a great chair an illustrated newspaper on her knees and brought her gaze back to the fire and her thoughts to larry she wondered what important matters he was discussing and what was the explanation which the doctor had offered after a while she looked up at the clock again half past ten she put down her paper and walked restlessly about the gorgeous apartment and then she heard the click of a door and dr judd came in from the hall i hope you haven t been lonely he said he will be in very shortly she took it for granted that the he to whom the doctor referred was larry holt i was getting worried she smiled what a beautiful room this is yes he said carelessly it is beautiful but one day we will have a more wonderful saloon to show you here he is said the doctor but it was not larry who came in she sprang to her feet with an exclamation of alarm the man who had entered was john dearborn he made no pretence now his glasses were gone and his fine eyes were surveying her with amusement where is mr holt she asked dearborn laughed softly you would like some supper he said and slipped back one of the panels by the side of the fireplace revealing a silver tray on which a meal for one had been laid we do not eat at night he carried the tray to the table and spread a lace cloth the girl s colour had gone she was in mortal peril but her voice did not quiver where is mr holt she asked again mr holt is quite happy it was the doctor who spoke we will let you see him later the strange words and the stranger tone frightened her and she got up from her chair and picked up her wrap i don t think i will stay any longer if mr holt is not here dr judd she said addressing that jovial man can you take me home the doctor did not reply he had pulled open a drawer of a lacquer bureau and had taken out a thick pad of papers and handed them to dearborn with a broad smile you re going to have a delightful time miss stuart he said really david it is most good of you i thought you would be too tired to night the girl looked from one to the other not daring to credit her own senses dr judd who had hitherto been polite to a point of obsequiousness was ignoring her i don t think you heard me dr judd she said steadily i want you to take me back to my to mr holt s flat she is thinking of her clothes murmured the doctor addressing his brother you will see that they are sent for won t you david sent for gasped the girl what do you mean david judd already she had ceased to think of him as dearborn had settled himself in the chair which she had lately occupied and was turning the leaves of his manuscript book i think you had better eat first you must be very hungry i will eat nothing in this house until i know what you mean by saying that my clothes will be brought here she said hotly i am going back alone dear young lady it was the doctor who laid his big hand on her arm please do not distract david he is going to read one of his beautiful plays to you do you know that david is the greatest dramatist in the world the supreme force in modern drama rivalling and indeed excelling the so called genius of shakespeare david looked at his brother and their eyes met he was so earnest so self convinced that she had no words for a moment then i am not in a mood to hear plays read however beautiful they are she said she had to keep a tight hold on herself for instinct warned her that her plight was desperate i don t think she will go back to night said the doctor almost regretfully perhaps to morrow when you are married to her he spoke timidly pleadingly and there was a question in his statement i shall not marry her said the man called dearborn sharply i thought we had arranged that brother jake is dead but there are others does it matter who marries her diana was dumb with indignation and horror they were discussing her marriage with one of them each trying to induce the other to wed her with a calmness and an assurance which left her speechless at last she found her voice i do not intend marrying either of you she said i am engaged to larry holt both men were looking at her and in the doctor s rubicund face there was an expression of distress it is a pity he said the whole thing could be arranged if mr holt were with us unfortunately though he is with us in the body we are spiritually as far as the poles apart with us in the body she repeated and was seized with a violent fit of trembling she had realized that the letter which lured her to this terrible house was a forgery and her hope of rescue was centred on the certainty that larry would discover her absence and come after her and then the two men exchanged glances and dearborn rose and put down his book with an air of resignation he beckoned her and passed to the other end of the apartment and there found a door which larry had overlooked for the edge of the panels which covered it so overlapped that no crevice was visible i designed this house myself he explained simply and built it myself with only twenty workmen from tuscany later she was to find much of that was true the chamber in which she found herself led by the fascination of a growing horror was unfurnished and unadorned she heard a strange humming sound and a curious vibration beneath her feet then david stopped fumbled with something on the floor and opened a little trap door less than a foot square it revealed a pane of glass and when her eyes had become accustomed to the unexpected perspective she saw beneath her a small room evidently lighted from the ceiling she had no time to take in the details of the room her eyes were focussed upon the figure that sat on the edge of the bed with his handkerchief he was binding a wound in his hand and at first she did not recognize him then he looked up for though he could not see the occupants of the room above he had heard the sound of the trap opening she stared and screamed for it was larry holt who sat there and he was chained by the ankle chapter xli diana pulls a lever dearborn put his arm about her waist and dragged her from the room into the saloon when he released her her knees gave way under her and she dropped to the floor everything must be seemly said dr judd gravely we cannot countenance a vulgar scene do i speak your mind brother exactly my dear answered david judd diana stared up at him from the floor resting her shaking body upon her arms what are you going to do with him she asked wildly again the brothers looked at one another you tell her doctor said david gently dr judd shook his head i think you should tell her my dear david he answered you are so very delicate in these matters bless you and remember he added that she is your wife david had seated himself and was leaning over the arm of the chair his immobile face fixed upon diana s when i have finished with him he said i shall drown him she started up her hand to her mouth my god she breathed the dreadful truth came upon the girl with a rush these men were madmen madmen who preserved all the outward appearance of sanity who day by day and for years had conducted a business with sane men and never once betrayed the kink in their unwholesome minds she shrank back from them farther and farther back until she was against the panelling of the opposite wall they were her father s murderers she thought she was going to faint but dug her nails into her palms in a tremendous effort to keep her senses mad and the world rubbed shoulders with them and never suspected shall i read asked david quietly yes yes read she said eagerly they were to kill larry when he had finished reading that was the thought which obsessed her as she turned her drawn face to the man the vanity of this monomaniac was flattered and he betrayed his agitation in his stumbling speech as he read the first two pages of his manuscript then his voice grew calmer and the girl understood in a wondering way that he was imparting into these dead and lifeless words a beauty which only his mind could see but which in some extraordinary way he was conveying also to her dr judd had slipped from his chair to the big bearskin rug before the fire and sat with his legs crossed his hands clasped before him his large eager face turned to his brother and here was another curious circumstance which the girl noted numbly those lines which seemed brilliant to david were brilliant also to the other and when he paused self consciously as if for applause it was always the doctor who anticipated his desire wonderful wonderful is he not a genius miss stuart asked stephen she glanced quickly at the other expecting to find him embarrassed but he sat bolt upright a complacent smile upon his heavy face a benevolence in his eyes and they were planning murder they had murdered many men in this terrible house she thought and wondered had they sat here whilst their victims fought their last fight in that horrible dungeon the one reading and the other listening to these trite sentences these age worn situations which both believed were the work of a supreme genius this is not my best work said david as though reading her thoughts you like it of course yes said the girl in a low voice go on please she hoped to keep them occupied throughout the whole of the night she knew that the police would be searching for larry and perhaps one of them knew this house in chelsea but those hopes were to be shattered and her heart gave a wild leap as she saw david close the manuscript book and put it tenderly on the table beside him brother he said i think the doctor nodded and it would be a gracious thing and a picturesque beginning for all the happiness which lies ahead of us if this fair hand he took the unresisting hand of diana in his and again he did not complete his sentence he took his keys from his pocket the keys that flash fred had so carefully duplicated and larry had duplicated again and walked to the door through which the girl had entered the room he smiled to himself as he inserted the key and the door swung open will you come this way dear girl he asked she hesitated then summoning her courage followed him down a flight of steps again there was a door at the end a little room filled with machinery she saw when he put on the light he walked to a switch you shall have the honour of releasing our friend we bear him no malice mr holt release him she asked huskily do you mean that she hesitated her hand upon the black lever in the wall why do you not open the door and let him out she asked suspiciously that will open the door and release him believe me my dear i would not in this hour deceive you it was the doctor who spoke in his softest tone and she hesitated no longer her brain was in a whirl she could not analyze either their motives or their sincerity nor could she appreciate the fact that to these men deception was a habit of thought she swung the lever back and it came more easily than she had expected then she looked at the door let us go and meet him said the doctor and put his arm round her shoulders she shivered but did not attempt to escape and so he led her up the stairs and back into the salon closing and locking the door behind him then before she could guess or anticipate his intentions the arm about her shoulders had become a grip as firm as a vise and she found herself pressed closely to the big man my wife i think brother he said undoubtedly your wife said the doctor for the world is yours to pick and take from my dear my wife repeated dearborn without emotion and brought his lips to hers she was frozen with terror incapable of movement why did not larry come then as suddenly as he had seized her the doctor released his hold and took her cold hand in his come back to the fire wife he said i will finish the third act of this great work of mine and by that time mr holt will be dead chapter xlii in the trap larry sat on the iron bedstead of the cell his aching head between his hands he had anticipated many ends to that night s adventure but never did he imagine that he would be trapped like a rat and that the mystery of box a would be solved in so startling a fashion so that was the explanation of gordon stuart s death he had accepted the invitation of dr judd to go with him in his box and there had met the sinister figure of dearborn he had either been drugged or clubbed to insensibility and had been carried in john dearborn s strong arms through the emergency door in the passage and whisked away to the house of death if he had not anticipated such an end to the evening he thought he had at least made some preparations instinctively he had known that of all places on the face of the earth where his quarry would be run down and finis might be written to the stuart case no other spot was so likely as in this terrible mansion which the judds had built for themselves and the object of his visit that morning had been twofold he desired to know and to see with his own eyes the evidence of the men s wickedness but he had also a wish to understand the ultimate danger to himself and to the girl he smiled as he thought of diana sitting snugly at home and wondered what she would feel if she knew his position his captor had taken from him every weapon he carried but that did not worry larry overmuch he got up from the bed and walked about the room but the weight of chain at his ankle made it necessary that he should gather a yard of it slack in his hand he gave one glance at the black holes in the wall near the floor for it was from these that danger would come well and truly had these men planned their execution room no cry for help no sound he might make would penetrate through these concrete walls the light in the ceiling was protected by a thick and heavy globe of glass it reminded him of a bulkhead light he wanted to test the length of the chain for he had ample time he thought dearborn would be in the house by now he heard the click of the trap door above and looked up but saw nothing he waited for another half hour then pushed over the big block of stone to which the chain was fastened before his eyes could fall upon the bag he had left there in his earlier visit the light went out curiously enough he had not provided for that contingency and he drew a sharp breath the bag was there his fingers touched and pulled it out and he groped inside for the keys had there been light there would have been no difficulty in selecting that which unlocked the anklet but now he tested three and none of them fitted the bronze clamp about his ankle he heard a sound a low gurgling sound such as water makes when it is poured from a bottle and then about his feet came an eddy of cold air he tried another key and that too failed him worse still it remained fixed in the lock and he could not pull it out he heard the rush of the water coming through the small holes in the wall and the dull throb of a pump he tugged at the key great beads of sweat running down his cheeks and then with a sigh of relief it came out the water was over his boots now and rising rapidly there was only one more key to try the rest were too big for the purpose he drew that out but the ward caught in the string of the bag in which he had put them and the key fell into the water he groped down it had gone again and again he flung his hand through the swirling water and his fingers groped along the rough concrete floor presently with a cry he felt it and lifting his ankle with an effort he inserted the key it turned the anklet opened and he was free there were still the two doors and he knew that with the pressure of water it would require his utmost efforts to open them the water was up to his waist now and he waded along the passage and up the two steps holding the waterproof bag between his teeth the key turned easily enough but there was no handle to pull and every second increased the pressure of the water he set his teeth and gripping the key in both hands he pulled steadily steadily chapter xliii the passing of david diana had heard the dread words without understanding them at first by that time mr holt will be dead she opened her mouth to scream but no sound came she had killed larry her hand had pulled the lever which drowned him that was the word judd had used drowned him but how as the thought took more definite shape she swayed toward the doctor and gripped his shoulder for support she would not faint she told herself she would not faint there must be a way of saving larry she looked around for some weapon but there was none and then she grew calmer they were madmen and must be humoured but the time was short again she assumed an attitude of attention but her mind and eyes were busy and as david judd leaned forward she saw something that brought a thrill of hope to her heart his jacket was open and showed just a glimpse of white shirt where his arm passed through the waistcoat and against that strip of white was a sharp black line she looked again and saw it was an automatic pistol worn in a holster under the armpit she remembered reading of desperadoes who carried their guns that way so that they might be ready to hand and possibly david had read too he was in the midst of an impassioned love scene when her hand darted forward and closed over the butt with a jerk she pulled it free and stepped back overturning the little table on which her supper tray had been laid if you move i ll kill you she said breathlessly open that door and release him the two men were on their feet staring at her you you interrupted my reading cried david in the tremulous voice of a hurt child he did not seem to be conscious of any danger open the door she breathed and release larry holt or i ll kill you david frowned and put his hand on the mantelpiece she saw his fingers touch a button and as the lights went out she fired the explosion deafened her a second later his strong arms were around her and he had flung her into the chair and stood glaring down at her you interrupted my reading he almost sobbed and dr judd a frowning figure looked anxiously from her to his brother and now said david petulantly i will not marry you his big hand gripped the edge of her bodice and dragged her to her feet his eyes were wet with tears the tears of pride of humiliation then with the sudden caprice of a madman he released her he is dead now i should think brother he said turning to the doctor and dr judd drew a sigh of relief and nodded yes he is dead now he said the water rises at the rate of one foot in two minutes i think one foot in a minute and fifty seconds said david spare him for god s sake cried the girl hoarsely i will give you anything anything in the world you want if it is money you shall have it i think she ought to see him said david ignoring her frenzied appeal there is no light said the doctor and shook his head of course not how stupid of me we always put the light out said david whose fit of anger seemed to have passed then the water comes up through the little holes at the bottom of the cell very very quickly it is pumped from the roof of the house we have a large tank there you know he went on and the person we drown cannot rise because of the weight of his feet once a man got on the bed do you remember i remember said the doctor in a conversational tone we had to put nine feet of water into the cell before he died she listened numbly it was a nightmare she told herself and presently she would wake and that takes a long time to pump out it was very thoughtless of him so much had to be done david continued and his brother was looking at him for the first time anxiously we had to dry the bed david went on and did you notice the chain was rusty brother that isn t right it is an eyesore to me he turned and looked at diana thoughtfully my wife he said in a low voice and there was a sudden fire in his eyes which terrified her my wife he said again and caught her to him with a horrible animal cry that set her shrinking i want you judd he spun round someone had come into the room and was standing now with a pistol aimed straight at the man s heart it was larry holt chapter xliv the end of the chase don t move said larry resistance is useless listen to that there was the faint sound of a crash in the hall those are police officers and they are inside the house said larry laconically slowly david pushed the girl away from him and faced the intruder looking at him from under his heavy brows larry did not see the man s hand move so quick was the motion a wind fanned his cheek a panel splintered and the two shots sounded like one to the half fainting girl david judd stood for a moment erect then staggered a little my beautiful plays he said and choked then without another word he crashed to the floor dead david david dr judd threw himself upon the body david don t act i will get you beautiful actors for your work i don t like to see you doing it david it frightens me tell him not to the big man his florid face gone white looked up appealingly at larry holt who stood with his smoking pistol in his hand his eyes fixed upon the two mr holt you have influence with him whined the doctor his face streaming with tears tell him please not to do this it frightens me when he acts sometimes he acts for hours in this room little pieces from his own wonderful plays you must ask him to read you some mr holt david he shook the body but david was beyond the voice of his brother then the doctor stood up he came across to larry laying his large hand on the other s like a frightened child larry was so overwhelmed by the tragedy of it all that he could not speak this grown man whose brilliant brain had conceived and dared so much was for a moment like a little child suddenly the doctor s head came up i am sorry he said huskily poor boy he looked at larry holt long and steadily mr holt he said i have been behaving childishly but i am perfectly sane i accept full responsibility for all my acts and all the acts of my brother i know quite well what i have done harvey had burst into the room and stopped dead at the scene until larry beckoned him forward take him he said i wish we had finished you said dr judd as they led him away the girl was in larry s arms now her face hidden against his shoulder this is the end of the bad road he whispered and she nodded as they came into the vestibule one of the police officers who filled the hall saluted him we ve taken the servant sir he was locked up in another part of the house he knows nothing about it said larry you can safely release him and anyway i haven t taken the trouble to get a warrant for him a tall man came out of the broken doorway which larry discovered led to the servants quarters and took the girl s hand in his you ve had a terrible experience miss stuart he said and she recognized the police commissioner and tried to smile i have my car here you had better come along larry harvey can charge dr judd they drove back to scotland yard and larry said very little on the journey he sat by the girl s side her hand in his and answered the questions the commissioner put to him briefly and without elaboration it was when they were back in the commissioner s office that larry spoke john he said i hope you are not going to report this matter to the government as an achievement on my part sir john looked at him with an inquiring frown of course i shall he said who else takes credit larry put his hand on the girl s shoulder here is the best detective we have had in scotland yard for many years he said simply diana laughed you silly man she scoffed of course i am not who was the best detective you could have had to deal with this case you he said she shook her head the best detective was dr judd if you could have secured his services and he was best because he knew most of this matter knew all the secrets which we were trying to discover i was in very much the same position i was inside the game once i knew as i did that clarissa stuart was myself i was able to mystify you for when it was clear that poor emma i nearly called her aunt poor emma ward was the charwoman who had seen my my father and had left in such a state of great agitation there was no doubt whatever in my mind that it was my father and when that was clear the rest was rather easy i knew then that i was the objective of the gang no larry you are and you have been wonderful larry shook his head with a smile anyway said the commissioner dryly does it matter who gets the credit why asked larry in surprise i mean so long as it goes into the family said sir john and the colour came to the girl s face there s a great deal in that sir john she said and now i am going to take him home that night after she had gone to bed and larry sat before his little fire his bright brier between his teeth and his mind at peace sunny came in to him bearing an armful of laundry two of your collars are missing sir and the man who wears the collars was nearly missing sunny chuckled larry do you know one of the first things i thought about in that infernal place was whether you d get the news in time to stop the papers i could have always sent them back sir said sunny gravely you re a cheerful soul said larry well were you named sunny and sunny he said i want to tell you that i m going to be married yes sir said sunny and his brows knit in thought well said larry well sir said sunny slowly i think you ll want some new socks they dress very smartly at monte carlo by jove said larry and then his face fell we can t go to monte carlo in the summer you silly ass it would be too hot no i m going to scotland for for after i m married sunny was interested then you ll be wanting a kilt sir he said chapter xlv three cigarettes two months later dr judd sat on the edge of a very small bed and smoked three cigarettes one after the other it was a rainy morning and the square of glass which gave light to the cell seemed to collect all the grayness and drabness of the day and transmute the faded light of heaven into a lead the doctor smoked luxuriously for he had not tasted a cigarette for the greater part of two months presently the door of the cell opened and larry came in judd jumped up to his feet and greeted the visitor with a smile it s awfully good of you to come holt he said i intended saying nothing but in the circumstances it seems to me only fair to a man of your position who has put in such a large amount of earnest and excellent work that you should know the truth he was altogether sincere larry knew that my brother david and i and this you will understand were on the most affectionate terms from our early childhood david was my care and my responsibility and he was also my joy we had both been left by our mother at a very early age and our father was an eccentric gentleman who had very little use for children so we grew up and went to the same public school and to the university together and i think i am right in saying that we were wholly sufficient for one another i had an admiration and a love for david beyond anything that is human said the doctor lowering his voice and looking down larry nodded he had recognized this quality in the two men i hope you will not think that i owe you a grudge because you killed david he said far from it i recognize the inevitability and in my heart i know that nothing could have saved david he died as he would have wished and in some respects i am very glad for all that has happened at the trial i made every effort to prove to the judge and the jury that i was perfectly sane and your evidence helped to secure the conviction which i knew was inevitable i thank you for it as i say he went back to the story of his early life and told stories of the childhood of himself and his brother when my father died he went on he left us the greenwich insurance company a small impoverished concern which was then on the verge of bankruptcy i can safely and honestly say that i have never respected the sanctity of human life to me a human being is like any other animal a kind of dumb lew he explained easily and larry could hardly restrain a shudder at the light hearted way he referred to this human wreck i tell you that before i go any further lest you expect anything in the shape of an apologetic attitude on my part if you do you will be disappointed the business to which my brother and i succeeded was bankrupt and i think we got our first idea for the subsequent operations when we had to pay out a risk which had been taken by my eccentric father and a risk which he should never have undertaken the idea of the scheme was partly mine and partly david s we began our experiments three months later when we drowned a man whose name i need not tell you since it would serve no useful purpose and no person is under suspicion for his death we had insured him in our own office a very simple process without his being any the wiser i myself had signed the medical report and david who was a clever draughtsman in addition to being a brilliant engineer the career for which he was trained signed all the necessary forms in his name we chose the man carefully he was one who had no friends and was regarded as being something of a recluse the policy was made payable in favour of a fictitious name which my brother had taken in scotland where he had furnished a small house and where he lived for the purposes of collection we made a large sum of money by this death for we had reinsured the life and there was little to do but to collect from the underwriters my brother was always something of a poet and when he was at oxford he wrote two or three plays which the managers of the london theatres rejected i need hardly tell you he said with the utmost gravity that they were wonderful plays though not of course as good as those i produced later at the macready theatre the macready was your property was it not said larry and the doctor inclined his head i bought it some time ago for the purpose of producing dear david s dramas he said it was the one thing for which i lived to establish david s name he had very early on taken the name of dearborn and it is curious that you had not compared the name that appeared on the playbills six years ago with the rev john dearborn they were compared said larry and our conclusions were drawn but not until a late stage in the investigations our next experiment was on a man named well i need not give this name either he said we had to wait a reasonable time before we bled the underwriters and here occurred an unfortunate thing one of our clerks discovered that the person to whom the money was paid was my brother he found it out by the veriest accident and began to blackmail david and finally fearing the consequence of this line of action he stole a considerable sum of money from the office and went to france david followed him and shot him in montpellier you know that part of the story very well mr holt he said with a good humoured smile flash fred saw the act committed and lived on me for years but only because he never accepted an invitation to dinner in my house he added with a little smile and now i come to the stuart case david who did a great deal of investigating of his own had as you know disappeared as the result of flash fred s recognition we gave him a very handsome funeral and he hesitated and the body was the brother of lew said larry quietly quite right agreed the doctor he was an awkward man and he had to go the whole thing had been simplified by now he explained my brother had built our beautiful house and the death chamber with its water its pump and its ventilator had been created by his genius it was my idea that we should buy up todd s home and curiously enough i had completed the sale before it became necessary for dear david to disappear mr grogan has not told you in all probability that we sought by every means in our power to induce him to come to the macready theatre to see a representation of one of my brother s dramas he saved himself not by any superhuman cleverness but because he had the low cunning of the rat which walks around the cage of a trap knowing that the trap is there yet unable to realize just how it works i will return to stuart he said we had laid our plans when stuart came into the box and our plans did not include any injury to him whilst he was in the theatre because we thought it would be a simple matter to persuade him to pass through the fire door into the car which was waiting in the private road which is the property and stands upon the grounds of the theatre stuart came my brother of course was not there though he was near enough at hand if i wanted him boxes a b and c were never let to the public by the way to our surprise he came in the most exalted mood and told us that he had discovered a daughter and then for the first time we knew that he was not an obscure stranger but a very rich man we took him back to the house and he went willingly and there we had a discussion dear david and i as to what should be done we came to the conclusion that there was nothing definite to be secured from this man if we let him live and it was very necessary indeed vitally necessary that money should come in at once i had spent a great deal of money some hundred thousand pounds he said airily as he lit his second cigarette on art treasures and another hundred thousand upon the theatre and we were being pressed very hard we decided that stuart should go he puffed at his cigarette and blew a ring to the ceiling he showed fight he said briefly by the way i have reason to believe that one of the cuff links which were torn off my shirt in that struggle was retrieved by you mr holt where did you find it in the dead man s hand said larry and dr judd nodded i was afraid i had not been very thorough he said but i am relieved because i thought that david was to blame david was careless in some matters he had told us had stuart all about his charwoman had given us her address and there and then we decided to find this clarissa and marry her to someone he shrugged his shoulders it did not matter whom so long as we could first of all prove her birth and then control her money the next day my brother went to confirm the man s story but he found difficulty the woman in charge of the nursing home it was a converted farm if you remember where mrs stuart died had disappeared and even the offer of a reward did not produce any results we had no difficulty in finding and capturing the charwoman blind jake who was a faithful servant of ours and nobody regrets his death more than myself but i also realize that it was necessary or had the appearance of necessity blind jake i say hurried her away and from the information she was able to supply us with i could trace clarissa stuart as diana ward i might add for your information he said addressing holt that the inquiries did not take more than half a day there is one question i should like to ask you doctor said larry quietly the lift accident was arranged by whom by david said the doctor with a little smile as though he were amused at something david was on the floor above and it was david who dropped things on your head they didn t reach your head of course which was unfortunate then he had an easy exit along the roof to the next building and i never admired you so much as when you refrained from going up those steps left so invitingly under the open trap door you would have come down very quickly he added significantly and that gentlemen really concludes my story and he took up the third cigarette for the second had been smoked very vigorously why did you spare lew asked larry he was one of your helpers and knew your secrets i was prepared to spare almost anybody unless my life was endangered said dr judd certainly i did not want to find all my good plans tumbling to the ground through the death of some wretched beggar who was quite harmless i only killed when it was necessary or profitable he said blind jake had his own vendettas and his attempt upon fanny weldon was a purely private affair in which we were not interested a man came in through the door of the cell a short stocky man who was bareheaded and dr judd took one long whiff of his cigarette dropped it on the floor of the cell and put his foot upon it the executioner i presume he said pleasantly and turned round putting his hands behind him the stocky man strapped him tight and the white robed clergyman whose ministrations he had refused and who was waiting outside the cell door came in and walked slowly by the doctor s side and so he went out of sight of larry who waited behind he saw the broad shoulders for the last time as they passed through the narrow door leading from the prison hall to the exercise yard and he waited feeling inexpressibly and unaccountably sad a minute passed and then there was a crash that came like thunder to his ears and made him start it was the crash of the falling death trap dr judd
