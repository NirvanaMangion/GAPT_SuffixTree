minerals hath all the principles magic doth require then doubt not faustus but to be renowm d and more frequented for this mystery than heretofore the delphian oracle the spirits tell me they can dry the sea and fetch the treasure of all foreign wrecks ay all the wealth that our forefathers hid within the massy entrails of the earth then tell me faustus what shall we three want faustus nothing cornelius o this cheers my soul come shew me some demonstrations magical that i may conjure in some lusty grove and have these joys in full possession valdes then haste thee to some solitary grove and bear wise bacon s and albertus works the hebrew psalter and new testament and whatsoever else is requisite we will inform thee ere our conference cease cornelius valdes first let him know the words of

become of faustus that was wont to make our schools ring with sic probo second scholar that shall we know for see here comes his boy enter wagner first scholar how now sirrah where s thy master wagner god in heaven knows second scholar why dost not thou know wagner yes i know but that follows not first scholar go to sirrah leave your jesting and tell us where he is wagner that follows not necessary by force of argument that you being licentiates should stand upon therefore acknowledge your error and be attentive second scholar why didst thou not say thou knewest wagner have you any witness on t first scholar yes sirrah i heard you wagner ask my fellow if i be a thief second scholar well you will not tell us wagner yes sir i will tell you yet if you were not dunces you would never ask me such a question for is not he corpus naturale and is not that mobile then wherefore should you ask me such a question but that i am by nature phlegmatic slow to wrath and prone to lechery to love i would say it were not for you to come within forty foot of the place of execution although i do not doubt to see you both hanged the next sessions thus having triumphed over you i will set my countenance like a precisian and begin to speak thus truly my dear brethren my master is within at dinner with valdes and cornelius as this wine if it could speak would inform your worships and so the lord bless you preserve you and keep you my dear brethren my dear brethren exit first scholar nay then i fear he is fallen into that damned art for which they two are infamous through the world second scholar were he a stranger and not allied to me yet should i grieve for him but come let us go and inform the rector and see if he by his grave counsel can reclaim him first scholar o but i fear me nothing can reclaim him second scholar yet let us try what we can do exeunt enter faustus to conjure faustus now that the gloomy shadow of the earth longing to view orion s drizzling look leaps from th antartic world unto the sky and dims the welkin with her pitchy breath faustus begin thine incantations and try if devils will obey thy hest seeing thou hast pray d and sacrific d to them within this circle is jehovah s name forward and backward anagrammatiz d th abbreviated names of holy saints figures of every adjunct to the heavens and characters of signs and erring stars by which the spirits are enforc d to rise then fear not faustus but be resolute and try the uttermost magic can perform sint mihi dei acherontis propitii valeat numen triplex jehovoe ignei aerii aquatani spiritus salvete orientis princeps belzebub inferni ardentis monarcha et demogorgon propitiamus vos ut appareat et surgat mephistophilis quod tumeraris per jehovam gehennam et consecratam aquam quam nunc spargo

and return an old franciscan friar that holy shape becomes a devil best exit mephistophilis i see there s virtue in my heavenly words who would not be proficient in this art how pliant is this mephistophilis full of obedience and humility such is the force of magic and my spells no faustus thou art conjuror laureat that canst command great mephistophilis quin regis mephistophilis fratris imagine re enter mephistophilis like a franciscan friar mephist now faustus what wouldst thou have me do faustus i charge thee wait upon me whilst i live to do whatever faustus shall command be it to

faustus did not he charge thee to appear to me mephist no i came hither of mine own accord faustus did not my conjuring speeches raise thee speak mephist that was the cause but yet per accidens for when we hear one rack the name of god abjure the scriptures and his saviour christ we fly in hope to get his glorious soul nor will we come unless he use such means whereby he is in danger to be damn d therefore the shortest cut for conjuring is stoutly to abjure the trinity and pray devoutly to the prince of hell faustus so faustus hath already done and holds this principle there is no chief but only belzebub to whom faustus doth dedicate himself this word damnation terrifies not him for he confounds hell in elysium his ghost be with the old philosophers but leaving these vain trifles of men s souls tell me what is that lucifer thy lord mephist arch regent and commander of all spirits faustus was not that lucifer an angel once mephist yes faustus and most dearly lov d of god faustus how comes it then that he is prince of devils mephist o by aspiring pride and insolence for which god threw him from the face of heaven faustus and what are you that live with lucifer mephist unhappy

hell mephist why this is hell nor am i out of it think st thou that i who saw the face of god and tasted the eternal joys of heaven am not tormented with ten thousand hells in being depriv d of everlasting bliss o faustus leave these frivolous demands which strike a terror to my fainting soul faustus what is great mephistophilis so passionate for being deprived of the joys of heaven learn thou of faustus manly fortitude and scorn those joys thou never shalt possess go bear these tidings to great lucifer seeing faustus hath incurr d eternal death by desperate thoughts against jove s deity say he surrenders up to him his soul so he will spare him four and twenty years letting him live in all voluptuousness having thee ever to attend on me to give me whatsoever i shall ask to tell me whatsoever i demand to slay mine enemies and aid my friends and always be obedient to my will go and return to mighty lucifer and meet me in my study at midnight and then resolve me of thy master s

bowels of these elements where we are tortur d and remain for ever hell hath no limits nor is circumscrib d in one self place for where we are is hell and where hell is there must we ever be and to conclude when all the world dissolves and every creature shall be purified all places shall be hell that are not heaven faustus come i think hell s a fable mephist ay think so still till experience change thy mind faustus why think st thou then that faustus shall be damn d mephist ay of necessity for here s the scroll wherein thou hast given thy soul to lucifer faustus ay and body too but what of that think st thou that faustus is so fond to imagine that after this life there is any pain tush these are trifles and mere old wives tales mephist but faustus i am an instance to prove the contrary for i am damn d and am now in hell faustus how now in hell nay an this be hell i ll willingly be damn d here what walking disputing c but leaving off this let me have a wife the fairest maid

take this book peruse it thoroughly gives book the iterating of these lines brings gold the framing of this circle on the ground brings whirlwinds tempests thunder and lightning pronounce this thrice devoutly to thyself and men in armour shall appear to thee ready to execute what thou desir st faustus thanks mephistophilis yet fain would i have a book wherein i might behold all spells and incantations that i might raise up spirits when i please mephist here they are in this book turns to them faustus now would i have a book where i might see all characters and planets of the heavens that i might know their motions and dispositions mephist here they are too turns to them faustus nay let me have one book more and then i have done wherein i might see all plants herbs and trees that grow upon the earth mephist here they be faustus o thou art deceived mephist tut i warrant thee turns to them faustus when i behold the heavens then i repent and curse thee wicked mephistophilis because thou hast depriv d me of those joys mephist why faustus thinkest thou heaven is such a glorious thing i tell thee tis not half so fair as thou or any man that breathes on earth faustus how prov st thou that mephist twas made for man therefore is man more excellent faustus if it were made for man twas made for me i will renounce this magic and repent enter good angel and evil angel good

mephistophilis why should i die then or basely despair i am resolv d faustus shall ne er repent come mephistophilis let us dispute again and argue of divine astrology tell me are there many heavens above the moon are all celestial bodies but one globe as is the substance of this centric earth mephist as are the elements such are the spheres mutually folded in each other s orb and faustus all jointly move upon one axletree whose terminine is term d the world s wide pole nor are the names of saturn mars or jupiter feign d but are erring stars faustus but tell me have they all one motion both situ et tempore mephist all jointly move from east to west in twenty four hours upon the poles of the world but differ in their motion upon the poles of the zodiac faustus tush these slender trifles wagner can decide hath mephistophilis no greater skill who knows not the double motion of the planets the first is finish d in a natural day the second thus as saturn in thirty years jupiter in twelve mars in four the sun venus and mercury in a year the moon in twenty eight days tush these are freshmen s suppositions but tell me hath every sphere a dominion or intelligentia mephist ay faustus how many heavens or spheres are there mephist nine the seven planets the firmament and the empyreal heaven faustus well resolve me in this question why have we not conjunctions oppositions

churches down lucifer do so and we will highly gratify thee faustus we are come from hell to shew thee some pastime sit down and thou shalt see all the seven deadly sins appear in their proper shapes

his head and as the knight awaked thinking to pull in his head he hit his hornes against the glasse that the panes thereof flew about his eares thinke here how this good gentleman was vexed for he could neither get backward nor forward after the emperor and the courtiers to their great amusement had beheld the poor knight in this condition faustus removed the horns when faustus having taken leave of the emperor was a league and a half from the city he was attacked in a wood by the knight and some of his companions they were in armour and mounted on fair palfreys but the doctor quickly overcame them by turning all the bushes into horsemen and so charmed them that every one knight and other for the space of a whole moneth did weare a paire of goates hornes on their browes and every
