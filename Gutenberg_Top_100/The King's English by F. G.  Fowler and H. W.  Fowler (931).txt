england preface the compilers of this book would be wanting in courtesy if they did not expressly say what might otherwise be safely left to the reader s discernment the frequent appearance in it of any author s or newspaper s name does not mean that that author or newspaper offends more often than others against rules of grammar or style it merely shows that they have been among the necessarily limited number chosen to collect instances from the plan of the book was dictated by the following considerations it is notorious that english writers seldom look into a grammar or composition book the reading of grammars is repellent because being bound to be exhaustive on a greater or less scale they must give much space to the obvious or the unnecessary and composition books are often useless because they enforce their warnings only by fabricated blunders against which every tiro feels himself quite safe the principle adopted here has therefore been to pass by all rules of whatever absolute importance that are shown by observation to be seldom or never broken and to illustrate by living examples with the name of a reputable authority attached to each all blunders that observation shows to be common the reader however who is thus led to suspect that the only method followed has been the rejection of method will find it is hoped a practical security against inconvenience in the very full index further since the positive literary virtues are not to be taught by brief quotation nor otherwise attained than by improving the gifts of nature with wide or careful reading whereas something may really be done for the negative virtues by mere exhibition of what should be avoided the examples collected have had to be examples of the bad and not of the good to this it must be added that a considerable proportion of the newspaper extracts are as is sometimes apparent not from the editorial but from the correspondence columns the names attached are merely an assurance that the passages have actually appeared in print and not been now invented to point a moral the especial thanks of the compilers are offered to dr bradley joint editor of the oxford english dictionary who has been good enough to inspect the proof sheets and whose many valuable suggestions have led to the removal of some too unqualified statements some confused exposition and some positive mistakes it is due to him however to say that his warnings have now and then been disregarded when it seemed that brevity or some other advantage could be secured without great risk of misunderstanding the oxford english dictionary itself has been of much service on all questions of vocabulary even if so slightly handled as in the first chapter of this book that great work is now

meaningless while commercialisms pet phrases also as conjunction and c chapter i vocabulary general any one who wishes to become a good writer should endeavour before he allows himself to be tempted by the more showy qualities to be direct simple brief vigorous and lucid this general principle may be translated into practical rules in the domain of vocabulary as follows prefer the familiar word to the far fetched prefer the concrete word to the abstract prefer the single word to the circumlocution prefer the short word to the long prefer the saxon word to the romance these rules are given roughly in order of merit the last is also the least it is true that it is often given alone as a sort of compendium of all the others in some sense it is that the writer whose percentage of saxon words is high will generally be found to have fewer words that are out of the way long or abstract and fewer periphrases than another and conversely but if instead of his saxon percentage s being the natural and undesigned consequence of his brevity and the rest those other qualities have been attained by his consciously restricting himself to saxon his pains will have been worse than wasted the taint of preciosity will be over all he has written observing that translate is derived from latin and learning that the elizabethans had another word for it he will pull us up by englishing his quotations he will puzzle the general reader by introducing his book with a foreword such freaks should be left to the germans who have by this time succeeded in expelling as aliens a great many words that were good enough for goethe and they indeed are very likely right because their language is a thoroughbred one ours is not and can now never be anything but a hybrid foreword is or may be saxon we can find out in the dictionary whether it is or not but preface is english dictionary or no dictionary and we want to write english not saxon add to this that even if the saxon criterion were a safe one more knowledge than most of us have is needed to apply it few who were not deep in philology would be prepared to state that no word in the following list extracted from the preface to the oxford dictionary is english battle beast beauty beef bill blue bonnet border boss bound bowl brace brave bribe bruise brush butt button dr murray observes that these are now no less native and no less important constituents of our vocabulary than the teutonic words there are moreover innumerable pairs of synonyms about which the saxon principle gives us no help the first to hand are ere and before both saxon save and except both romance anent and about both saxon again here if the saxon rule has nothing to say the familiar rule leaves no doubt the intelligent reader whom our writer has to consider will possibly not know the linguistic facts indeed he more likely than not takes save for a saxon word but he does know the reflections that the words if he happens to be reading leisurely enough for reflection excite in him as he comes to save he wonders why not except at sight of ere he is irresistibly reminded of that sad spectacle a mechanic wearing his sunday clothes on a weekday and anent to continue the simile is nothing less than a masquerade costume the oxford dictionary says drily of the last word common in scotch law phraseology and affected by many english writers it might have gone further and said affected in any english writer such things are antiquarian rubbish wardour street english why not as our imagined intelligent reader asked why not before except and about bread is the staff of life and words like these which are common and are not vulgar which are good enough for the highest and not too good for the lowest are the staple of literature the first thing a writer must learn is that he is not to reject them unless he can show good cause before and except it must be clearly understood have such a prescriptive right that to use other words instead is not merely not to choose these it is to reject them it may be done in poetry and in the sort of prose that is half poetry to do it elsewhere is to insult before to injure ere which is a delicate flower that will lose its quality if much handled and to make one s sentence both pretentious and frigid it is now perhaps clear that the saxon oracle is not infallible it will sometimes be dumb and sometimes lie nevertheless it is not without its uses as a test the words to be chosen are those that the probable reader is sure to understand without waste of time and thought a good proportion of them will in fact be saxon but mainly because it happens that most abstract words which are by our second rule to be avoided are romance the truth is that all five rules would be often found to give the same answer about the same word or set of words scores of illustrations might be produced let one suffice in the contemplated eventuality a phrase no worse than what any one can pick for himself out of his paper s leading article for the day is at once the far fetched the abstract the periphrastic the long and the romance for if so it does not very greatly matter by which of the five roads the natural is reached instead of the monstrosity so long as it is reached the five are indicated because they differ in directness and in any given case only one of them may be possible we will now proceed to a few examples of how not to write roughly classified under the five headings though after what has been said it will cause no surprise that most of them might be placed differently some sort of correction is suggested for each but the reader will indulgently remember that to correct a bad sentence satisfactorily is not always possible it should never have existed that is all that can be said in particular sentences overloaded with abstract words are in the nature of things not curable simply by substituting equivalent concrete words there can be no such equivalents the structure has to be more or less changed prefer the familiar word to the far fetched the old imperial naval policy which has failed conspicuously because it antagonized the unalterable supremacy of colonial nationalism times stood in the way of that national ambition which must always be uppermost in the colonial mind buttercups made a sunlight of their own and in the shelter of scattered coppices the

of them is not likely to be effective i have no particular business at l said he i was merely going thither to pass a day or two borrow there prefer the concrete word or rather expression to the abstract it may be here remarked that abstract expression and the excessive use of nouns are almost the same thing the cure consists very much therefore in the clearing away of noun rubbish the general poverty of explanation as to the diction of particular phrases seemed to point in the same direction cambridge university reporter it was perhaps owing to this also that the diction of particular phrases was often so badly explained an elementary condition of a sound discussion is a frank recognition of the gulf severing two sets of facts times there can be no sound discussion where the gulf severing two sets of facts is not frankly recognized the signs of the times point to the necessity of the modification of the system of administration times it is becoming clear that the administrative system must be modified no year passes now without evidence of the truth of the statement that the work of government is becoming increasingly difficult spectator every year shows again how true it is that the first private conference relating to the question of the convocation of representatives of the nation took place yesterday times on national representation there seems to have been an absence of attempt at conciliation between rival sects daily telegraph the sects seem never even to have tried mutual conciliation zeal however must not outrun discretion in changing abstract

the military colleges were promoted to officers at the palace of tsarskoe selo yesterday times prefer the single word to the circumlocution as the word case seems to lend itself particularly to abuse

long one of the most important reforms mentioned in the rescript is the unification of the organization of the judicial institutions and the guarantee for all the tribunals of the independence necessary for securing to all classes of the community equality before the law times is that of the courts which need a uniform system and the independence without which it is impossible for all men to be equal before the law i merely desired to point out the principal reason which i believe exists for the great exaggeration which is occasionally to be observed in the estimate of the importance of the contradiction between current religion and current science put forward by thinkers of reputation balfour why in my opinion some well known thinkers make out the contradiction between current religion and current science to be so much more important than it is sir will you permit me to homologate all you say to day regarding that selfish minority of motorists who times agree with on the berlin bourse to day the prospect of a general strike was cheerfully envisaged times faced prefer the saxon word to the romance despite the unfavourable climatic conditions guernsey advertiser bad as the weather has been by way of general rules for the choice of words so much must suffice and these must be qualified by the remark that what is suitable for one sort of composition may be unsuitable for another the broadest line of this kind is that between poetry and prose but with that we are not concerned poetry being quite out of our subject there are other lines however between the scientific and the literary styles the dignified and the familiar our rendering of the passage quoted from mr balfour for instance may be considered to fall below the dignity required of a philosophic essay the same might with less reason be said of our simplified newspaper extracts a great journal has a tone that must be kept up if it had not been for that we should have dealt with them yet more drastically but a more candid plea for the journalist and one not without weight would be that he has not time to reduce what he wishes to say into a simple and concrete form it is in fact as much easier for him to produce as it is harder for his reader to understand the slipshod abstract stuff that he does rest content with but it may be suspected that he often thinks the length of his words and his capacity for dealing in the abstract to be signs of a superior mind as long as that opinion prevails improvement is out of the question but if it could once be established that simplicity was the true ideal many more writers would be found capable of coming near it than ever make any effort that way now the fact remains at any rate that different kinds of composition require different treatment but any attempt to go into details on the question would be too ambitious the reader can only be warned that in this fact may be found good reasons for sometimes disregarding any or all of the preceding rules moreover they must not be applied either so unintelligently as to sacrifice any really important shade of meaning or so invariably as to leave an impression of monotonous and unrelieved emphasis the rest of this chapter will be devoted to more special and definite points malaprops neologisms americanisms foreign words bad formations slang and some particular words

may be called a synonym for any of these verbs but it must be remembered that no synonyms are ever precise equivalents the peculiarity of eke out is that it implies difficulty in technical language agreeing with supplement in its denotation it has the extra connotation of difficulty but it does not mean to make nor to endure from its nature it will very seldom be used correctly though it conceivably might without the source of the addition s being specified in the first of the quotations it is rightly used in the second it is given the wrong meaning of make and in the last the equally wrong one of endure a writer with a story to tell that is not very fresh usually ekes it out by referring as much as possible to surrounding objects h james she had contrived taking one year with

next some isolated illustrations of our present heading there are many things in the commonwealth of nowhere which i rather wish than hope to see adopted in our own it was with these words of characteristic irony that more closed the great work j r green the word irony is one of the worst abused in the language but it was surely never more gratuitously imported than in this passage there could be no more simple direct and literal expression of more s actual feeling than his words now any definition of irony though hundreds might be given and very few of them would be accepted must include this that the surface meaning and the underlying meaning of what is said are not the same the only way to make out that we have irony here is to suppose that more assumed that the vulgar would think that he was speaking ironically whereas he was really serious a very topsy turvy explanation satire however with which irony is often confused would have passed a literary tour de force a recrudescence two or three generations later of the very respectable william lamb afterwards lord melbourne his unhappy wife lady caroline lamb and lord byron times reincarnation avatar resurrection recrudescence is becoming quite a fashionable journalistic word it properly means the renewed inflammation of a wound and so the breaking out again of an epidemic c it may reasonably be used of revolutionary or silly opinions to use it of persons or their histories is absurd a colonel on the general staff while arguing for a continuation of the struggle on metaphysical grounds admitted to me that even if the russians regained manchuria they would never succeed in colonizing it the bourse gazette goes still further it says that war for any definite purpose ceased with the fall of mukden and that its continuation is apparent not from any military or naval actions but from the feeling of depression which is weighing upon all russians and the reports of the peace overtures times we can suggest no substitute for metaphysical though we have long known metaphysics for a blessed and mysterious word this is our first meeting with it in war or politics the apparent continuation however seems darkly to hint at the old question between phenomena and real existence so that perhaps we actually are in metaphysics all the time in a word m witte was always against all our aggressive measures in the far east m witte who was always supported by count lamsdorff has no share in the responsibility of all that has transpired times happened as a synonym for become known transpire is

of the danger attending ignorant archaism in a word count von b low who took a very rosy view of the agreement last year now suddenly discovers that he was slighted and is indignant in the paulo post

been killed it has further no application here paulo ante past tense if there were such a thing might have meant something as it is pedantry is combined with inaccuracy words used in unaccustomed though not impossible senses or applications this is due sometimes to that avoidance of the obvious which spoils much modern writing and sometimes to an ignorance of english idiom excusable in a foreigner but not in a native no one can imagine non intervention carried through so desperate and so consequential a war as this greenwood if important or fateful will not do it is better to write a war so desperate and so pregnant with consequences than to abuse a word whose idiomatic uses are particularly well marked a consequential person is one who likes to exhibit his consequence a consequential amendment is one that is a natural consequence or corollary of another half of mr roosevelt s speech deals with this double need of justice and strength the other half being a skilled application of washington s maxims to present circumstances times skilful idiom confines skilled except in poetry almost entirely to the word labour and to craftsmen a skilled mason for instance it is to the convention therefore that reference must be made for an intelligence of the principles on which the egyptian government has acted during the present war times understanding no one can say why intelligence should never be followed by an objective genitive as grammarians call this but nearly every one knows apart from the technical term that it never is idiom is an autocrat with whom it is

guernsey advertiser we have touched shortly upon some four dozen of what we call malaprops now possible malaprops in our extended sense are to be reckoned not by the dozen but by the million moreover out of our four dozen not more than some half a dozen are uses that it is worth any one s while to register individually in his mind for avoidance the conclusion of which is this we have made no attempt at cataloguing the mistakes of this sort that must not be committed every one must construct his own catalogue by care observation and the resolve to use no word whose meaning he is not sure of even though that resolve bring on him the extreme humiliation of now and then opening the dictionary our aim has been not to make a list but to inculcate a frame of mind neologisms most people of literary taste will say on this point it must needs be that offences come but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh they are liberal conservatives their liberalism being general and theoretic their conservatism particular and practical and indeed if no new words were to appear it would be a sign that the language was moribund but it is well that each new word that does appear should be severely scrutinized the progress of arts and sciences gives occasion for the large majority of new words for a new thing we must have a new name hence for instance motor argon appendicitis it is interesting to see that the last word did not exist or was at least too obscure to be recorded when the oxford dictionary began to come out in we can not do without it now nor is there in the same volume any sign of argon which now has three pages of the encyclopaedia britannica to itself the discoverers of it are to be thanked for having also invented for it a name that is short intelligible to those at least who know greek free of barbarism and above all pronounceable as to barbarism it might indeed be desired that the man of science should always call in the man of greek composition as godfather to his gas or his process but it is a point of less importance every one has been told at school how telegram ought to be telegrapheme but by this time we have long ceased to mourn for the extra syllable and begun seriously to consider whether the further shortening into wire has not been resisted as long as honour demands among other arts and sciences that of lexicography happens to have found convenient a neologism that may here be used to help in the very slight classification required for the new words we are more concerned with that is those whose object is literary or general and not scientific a nonce word and the use might be extended to nonce phrase and nonce sense the latter not necessarily though it may be sometimes equivalent to nonsense is one that is constructed to serve a need of the moment the writer is not seriously putting forward his word as one that is for the future to have an independent existence he merely has a fancy to it for this once the motive may be laziness avoidance of the obvious love of precision or desire for a brevity or pregnancy that the language as at present constituted does not seem to him to admit of the first two are bad motives the third a good and the last a mixed one but in all cases it may be said that a writer should not indulge in these unless he is quite sure he is a good writer the couch bunk under the

or of a peace famous general just as we often have occasion to speak of a carpet knight but of a carpet broom only if it is necessary to guard against mistake russia s disposition is aggressive japan may conquer but she will not aggress times though aggress is in the dictionary every one will feel that it is rare enough to be practically a neologism and here a nonce word the mere fact that it has

illustrated in the outlook this week which westminster gazette all these formations whether happy or the reverse may be assumed to be conscious ones the few that now follow we shall call them new even

prevent a repetition of the same question times failure the best safeguard against any deplacement of the centre of gravity in the dual monarchy times displacement which would condemn the east to a long period of unquiet times unrest mere slips very likely if it is supposed that therefore they are not worth notice the answer is that they are indeed quite unimportant in a writer who allows himself only one such slip in fifty or a hundred pages but one who is unfortunate enough to make a second before the first has faded from the memory becomes at once a suspect we are uneasily on the watch for his next lapse wonder whether he is a foreigner or an englishman not at home in the literary language and fall into that critical temper which is the last he would choose to be read in the next two examples are quite distinct from these words clearly created or exhumed because the writer feels that his style requires galvanizing into energy a man of a cold perseverant character carlyle robbed of the just fruits of her victory by the arbitrary and forceful interference of outside powers times all the specimens yet mentioned have been productions of individual caprice the writer for some reason or other took a liberty or made a mistake with one expression he might as well or as ill have done it with another enjoying his little effect or taking his little nap at this moment or at that but there are other neologisms of a very different kind which come into existence as the crystallization of a political tendency or a movement in ideas prime minister cabinet his majesty s opposition have been neologisms of this kind in their day all standing for particular developments of the party system and all of them probably in more or less general use before they made their way into books such words in our day are racial and intellectuals the former is an ugly word the strangeness of which is due to our instinctive feeling that the termination al has no business at the end of a word that is not obviously latin nevertheless the new importance that has been attached for the last half century to the idea of common descent as opposed to that of mere artificial nationality has made a word necessary racial is not the word that might have been ornamental as well as useful but it is too well established to be now uprooted intellectuals is still apologized for in by the spectator as a convenient neologism it is already familiar to all who give any time to observing continental politics though the index to the encyclopaedia knows it not a use has not yet been found for the word in home politics as far as we have observed but the fact that intellect in any country is recognized as a definite political factor is noteworthy and we should hail intellectuals as a good omen for the progress of the world these and the scientific are the sort of neologism that may fairly be welcomed but there is this distinction with the strictly scientific words writers have not the power to decide whether they shall accept them or not they must be content to take submissively what the men of science choose to give them they being as much within their rights in naming what they have discovered or invented as an explorer in naming a new mountain or an american founder a new city minneapolis pikeville and pennsylvania may have a barbaric sound but there they are so telegram or aestho physiology the proud father of the latter herbert spencer confesses to having docked it of a syllable and similarly mr lecky writes of a eudaemometer measuring with accuracy the degrees of happiness realized by men in different ages consequently there will be some who will wish these long words longer though more who will wish them shorter but grumble as we may the patria potestas is indefeasible on the other hand with such words as racial intellectuals it is open to any writer if he does not like the word that threatens to occupy an obviously vacant place to offer a substitute or at least to avoid giving currency to what he disapproves it will be remembered that when it was proposed to borrow from france what we now know as the closure it seemed certain for some time that with the thing we should borrow the name cl ture a press campaign resulted in closure for which we may be thankful the same might have been done for or rather against racial if only some one had thought of it in time americanisms though we take these separately from foreign words which will follow next the distinction is purely pro forma americanisms are foreign words and should be so treated to say this is not to insult the american language if any one were asked to give an americanism without a moment s delay he would be more likely than not to mention i guess inquiry into it would at once bear out the american contention that what we are often rude enough to call their vulgarisms are in fact good old english i gesse is a favourite expression of chaucer s and the sense he sometimes gives it is very finely distinguished from the regular yankee use but though it is good old english it is not good new english if we use the phrase parenthetically that is like chaucer and the yankees we have it not from chaucer but from the yankees and with their not his exact shade of meaning it must be recognized that they and we in parting some hundreds of years ago started on slightly divergent roads in language long before we did so in politics in the details of divergence they have sometimes had the better of us fall is better on the merits than autumn in every way it is short saxon like the other three season names picturesque it reveals its derivation to every one who uses it not to the scholar only like autumn and we once had as good a right to it as the americans but we have chosen to let the right lapse and to use the word now is no better than larceny the other side of this is that we are entitled to protest when any one assumes that because a word of less desirable character is current american it is therefore to be current english there are certain american verbs that remind englishmen of the barbaric taste illustrated by such town names as memphis and those mentioned in the last section a very firm stand ought to be made against placate transpire and antagonize all of which have english patrons there is a real danger of our literature s being americanized and that not merely in details of vocabulary which are all that we are here directly concerned with but in its general tone mr rudyard kipling is a very great writer and a patriotic his influence is probably the strongest that there is at present in the land but he and his school are americanizing us his style exhibits a sort of remorseless and scientific efficiency in the choice of epithets and other words that suggests the application of coloured photography to description the camera is superseding the human hand we quote two sentences from the first page of a story and remark that in pre kipling days none of the words we italicize would have been likely now they may be matched on nearly every page of an up to date novelist between the snow white cutter and the flat topped honey coloured rocks on the beach the green water was troubled with shrimp pink prisoners of war bathing kipling far out a three funnelled atlantic transport with turtle bow and stern waddled in from the deep sea kipling the words are as we said extremely efficient but the impulse that selects them is in harmony with american not with english methods and we hope it may be developed in america rather than here we can not go more fully into the point in a digression like this but though we have digressed it has not been quite without purpose any one who agrees with us in this will see in it an additional reason for jealously excluding american words and phrases the english and the american language and literature are both good things but they are better apart than mixed fix up organize back of behind anyway at any rate standpoint point of view back number antiquated right along continuously some to some extent just quite or very just lovely may be added as typical americanisms of a different kind from either fall or antagonize but it is not worth while to make a large collection every one knows an americanism at present when he sees it how long that will be true is a more anxious question and back of all that a circumstance which gave great force to all that either has ever said the rank and file the great mass of the people on either side were determined choate hand power back number flint and steel reaping machines kipling some of them have in secret approximated their standpoint to that laid down by count tisza in his programme speech times we close the section by putting placate and antagonize in the pillory it may be remarked that the latter fits in well enough with emerson s curious bizarre style another use of just is pilloried also because it is now in full possession of our advertisement columns and may be expected to insinuate itself into the inside sheets before long when once placated the senators will be reluctant to deprive honest creditors of their rights spectator it is true the subject is american politics but even so we should have liked to see this stranger received ceremoniously as well as politely that is with quotation marks the italics are ours only the old imperial naval policy which has failed conspicuously because it antagonized the unalterable supremacy of colonial nationalism times if fate follows and limits power power attends and antagonizes fate emerson have you ever thought just how much it would mean to the home if advertisements passim foreign words the usual protest must be made to be treated no doubt with the usual disregard the difficulty is that some french latin and other words are now also english though the fiction that they are not is still kept up by italics and with french words conscientious efforts at pronunciation such are t te t te ennui status quo raison d tre eirenicon n glig and perhaps hundreds more the novice who is told to avoid foreign words and then observes that these english words are used freely takes the rule for a counsel of perfection not accepted by good writers and certainly not to be accepted by him who is sometimes hard put to it for the ornament that he feels his matter deserves even with the best will in the world he finds that there are many words of which he can not say whether they are yet english or not as gaucherie b tise camaraderie soup on so that there is no drawing the line he can only be told that all words not english in appearance are in english writing ugly and not pretty and that they are justified only if they afford much the shortest or clearest if not the only way to the meaning this is usually true of the words we have called really english or if they have some special appropriateness of association or allusion in the sentence they stand in this will be illustrated by some of the diplomatic words given below and by the quotation containing the word chasseur some little assistance may however be given on details to say distrait instead of absent or absent minded bien entendu for of course sans for without it is like i guess good old english but not good english quand m me for anyhow penchant for liking or fancy r daction for editing or edition co te que co te for at all costs schadenfreude for malicious pleasure uvre for work alma mater except with strong extenuating circumstances for university is pretension and nothing else the substitutes we have offered are not insisted upon they may be wrong or not the best but english can be found for all these moreover what was said of special association or allusion may apply to call a luncheon d jeuner however as in the appended extract because it is to be eaten by frenchmen is hardly covered by this though it is a praise worthy attempt at what the critics call giving an atmosphere it was resolved that on the occasion of the visit of the french fleet in august the corporation should offer the officers an appropriate reception and invite them to a d jeuner at the guildhall times but speaking broadly what a writer effects by using these ornaments is to make us imagine him telling us he is a wise fellow and one that hath everything handsome about him including a gentlemanly acquaintance with the french language some illustrations follow motorists lose more than they know by b tises of this kind times his determination to conduct them to a successful issue co te que co te might result in complications times the gloom which the russian troubles have caused at belgrade has to some extent been lightened by a certain schadenfreude over the difficulties with which the hungarian crisis threatens the neighbouring monarchy times a recent reperusal left the impression which is so often produced by the exhibition in bulk of the uvre of a deceased royal academician it has emphasized schiller s deficiencies without laying equal emphasis on his merits times the following are instances of less familiar french or latin words used wantonly so one would have thought the fever of new york was abated here even as the smoke of the city was but a gray tache on the horizon e f benson either we know that tache means stain or we do not if we do we can not admire our novelist s superior learning if we do not we must be doubtful whether we grasp the whole of his possibly valuable meaning his calculation is perhaps that we shall know it and shall feel complimented by his just confidence in us when the normal convention governing the relations between victors and vanquished is duly re established it will be time to chronicle the conjectures relating to peace in some other part of a journal than that devoted to faits divers times it is true the times does not condescend to an odds and ends or a miscellaneous column but many other english newspapers do under various titles and the times writer might have thrown the handkerchief to one of them but times have changed and this procedure enters into the category of vieille escrime when not employed by a master hand and made to correspond superficially with facts times in relation to military organization we are still in the flourishing region of the vieilles perruques times the users of these two varieties who to judge from the title at the head of their articles are one and the same person must have something newer than vieux jeu just as that has begun to be intelligible to the rest of us it becomes itself vieux jeu to them it is like the man of highest fashion changing his hat brim because the man of middling fashion has found the pattern of it the familiar gentleman burglar who having played wolf to his fellows qua financier journalist and barrister undertakes to raise burglary from being a trade at least to the lupine level of those professions times it is quite needless and hardly correct to use qua instead of as except where a sharp distinction is being made between two coexistent functions or points of view as in the next quotation uganda needs quite different treatment if it is regarded as a country from what it needs as a campaigning ground for this point must be borne constantly in mind the money spent to date was spent with a view only to strategy the real development of the country qua country must begin to day times the reader would not care to have my impressions thereanent and indeed it would not be worth while to record them as they were the impressions of an ignorance crasse c bront the writer who allows charlotte bront s extraordinarily convincing power of presentment to tempt him into imitating her many literary peccadilloes will reap disaster thereanent is as annoying as ignorance crasse it was he who by doctoring the ems dispatch in converted a chamade into a fanfaronnade and thus rendered the franco german war inevitable times we can all make a shrewd guess at the meaning of fanfaronnade how many average readers have the remotest idea of what a chamade is and is the function of newspapers to force upon us against our will the buying of french dictionaries among the diplomatic words entente may pass as suggesting something a little more definite and official than good understanding d menti because though it denotes the same as denial or contradiction it connotes that no more credence need be given to it than is usually given to the honest men sent to lie abroad for the good of their country as for ballon d essai we see no advantage in it over kite and flying a kite which are good english it is however owing to foreign correspondents perverted tastes already more familiar the words italicized in the following quotations are still more questionable the two special correspondents in berlin of the leading morning newspapers the matin and the cho de paris report a marked d tente in the situation times entente is comprehensible to every one but with d tente many of us are in the humiliating position of not knowing whether to be glad or sorry all the great newspapers have insisted upon the inopportuneness of the d marche of william ii times proceeding the entourage and counsellors of the sultan continue to remain sceptical times mere laziness even if the word means anything different from counsellors but the writer has at least given us an indication that it is only verbiage by revealing his style in continue to remain in diplomatic circles the whole affair is looked upon as an acte de malveillance towards the anglo french entente times you have been immensely amused cyrenaically enjoying the moment for the moment s sake but looking before and after as you can not help looking in the theatre you have been disconcerted and d rout times in spite however of this denial and of other official d mentis the italian press still seems dissatisfied times in this there is clearly not the distinction that we suggested between denial and d menti the only thing that could excuse the latter we have here merely one of those elegant variations treated of in the chapter airs and graces it sometimes occurs to a writer that he would like to avail himself of a foreign word or phrase whether to make a genuine point or to show that he has the gift of tongues and yet not keep his less favoured readers in the dark he accordingly uses a literal translation instead of the actual words it may fairly be doubted whether this is ever worth while but there is all the difference in the world as we shall presently exemplify in a pair of contrasted quotations between the genuine and the ostentatious use the most familiar phrase thus treated is cela va sans dire we have of our own i need hardly say needless to remark and many other varieties and the french phrase has no wit or point in it to make it worth aping we might just as well say in similar german or french english whichever of the two languages we had it from that understands itself each of them has to us the quaintness of being non idiomatic and no other merit whatever a single word that we have taken in the same way is more defensible because it did when first introduced here possess a definite meaning that no existing english word had epochmaking is a literal translation or transliteration almost from german we may regret that we took it now for it will always have an alien look about it and recent in english as it is it has already lost its meaning it belongs in fact to one of those word series of which each member gets successively worn out epochmaking is now no more than remarkable as witness this extract from a speech by the lord chancellor the banquet to m berryer and the banquet to mr benjamin both of them very important and to my mind epochmaking occasions lord halsbury the verb to orient is a gallicism of much the same sort and the half world is perhaps worse in his quality of eligible bachelor he had no objections at any time to conversing with a goodlooking girl only he wished very much that he could orient this particular one crockett high society is represented by lady beauminster the half world by mrs montrose loveliness and luckless innocence by her daughter helen times the next extract is perhaps from the pen of a french speaker trying to write english but it is not worse than what the english writer who comes below him does deliberately our enveloping movement which has been proceeding since several days times making every allowance for special circumstances the manner in which these amateur soldiers of seven weeks service acquitted themselves compels one furiously to think westminster gazette a warning may be given that it is dangerous to translate if you do not know for certain what the original means to ask what the devil some one was doing in that gallery is tempting and fatal appended are the passages illustrating the two different motives for translation if we could take this assurance at its face value and to the foot of the letter we should have to conclude times it will be observed a that literally gives the meaning perfectly b that to the foot of the letter is absolutely unintelligible to any one not previously acquainted with au pied de la lettre c that there is no wit or other admirable quality in the french itself the writer is meanly admiring mean things nothing could possibly be more fatuous than such half hearted gallicizing i thought afterwards but it was the spirit of the staircase what a pity it was that i did not stand at the door with a hat saying give an obol to belisarius morley the french have had the wit to pack into the words esprit d escalier the common experience that one s happiest retorts occur to one only when the chance of uttering them is gone the door is closed and one s feet are on the staircase that is well worth introducing to an english audience the only question is whether it is of any use to translate it without explanation no one will know what spirit of the staircase is who is not already familiar with esprit d escalier and even he who is may not recognize it in disguise seeing that esprit does not mean spirit which suggests a goblin lurking in the hall clock but wit we can not refrain from adding a variation that deprives au pied de la lettre even of its quaintness the tone of russian official statements on the subject is not encouraging but then perhaps they ought not to be taken at the letter times closely connected with this mistake of translating is the other of taking liberties with foreign phrases in their original form dovetailing them into the construction of an english sentence when they do not lend themselves to it in latin words and phrases other cases should always be changed to the nominative whatever the government in the english sentence unless the latin word that accounted for the case is included in the quotation it will be admitted that all the four passages below are ugly the whole party were engaged ohne rast with a prodigious quantity of hast in a continuous social effort e f benson german in which so few englishmen are at their ease is the last among the half dozen best known languages to play these tricks with the facetiousness here is indescribably heavy the clergy in rochet alb and other best pontificalibus carlyle the intention is again facetious but the incongruity between a latin inflected ablative and english uninflected objectives is a kind of piping to which no man can dance that the english in and the latin in happen to be spelt alike is no defence it is clear that in is here english not latin either in pontificalibus or in other pontificalia the feeling that one is an antecedentem scelestum after whom a sure though lame nemesis is hobbling trollope antecedens scelestus is necessary which were so evident in the days of the early church are now non est daily telegraph all things considered i wonder they were not non est long ago times such maltreatment of non est inventus which seems to have amused some past generations is surely now as stale and unprofitable as individual itself a special caution may be given about some words and phrases that either are shams or are used in wrong senses of the first kind are nom de plume morale the french for the name that an author chooses to write under is nom de guerre we in the pride of our knowledge that guerre means war have forgotten that there is such a thing as metaphor assumed that another phrase is required for literary campaigning thereupon ascertained the french for pen and so evolved nom de plume it is unfortunate for we now have to choose between a blunder and a pedantry but writers who know the facts are beginning to reconcile themselves to seeming pedantic for a time and reviving nom de guerre the french for what we call morale writing it in italics under the impression that it is french is actually moral the other is so familiar however that it is doubtful whether it would not be better to drop the italics keep the e and tell the french that they can spell their word as they please and we shall do the like with ours so mr kipling the gaul ever an artist breaks enclosure to study the morale sic at the present day of the british sailorman kipling in the second class of phrases whose meaning is mistaken we choose scandalum magnatum arri re pens e phantasmagoria and cui bono scandalum magnatum is a favourite with the lower class novelist who takes magnatum for a participle meaning magnified and finds the combination less homely than a shocking affair it is a genitive plural noun and the amplified translation of the two words which we borrow from the encyclopaedia runs slander of great men such as peers judges or great officers of state whereby discord may arise within the realm arri re pens e we have seen used with comic intent but sad effect for a bustle or dress improver and with sad intent but comic effect for an afterthought it is better confined to its real meaning of an ulterior object if indeed we can not be content with our own language and use those words instead phantasmagoria is a singular noun at least the corresponding french monstrosity fantasmagorie is unmistakably singular and if used at all in english it should be so with us too but the final a irresistibly suggests a plural to the valorous writers who are impressed without being terrified by the unknown so not that such phantasmagoria are to be compared for a moment with such desirable things as fashion fine clothes borrow cui bono is a notorious trap for journalists it is naturally surprising to any one who has not pushed his classics far to be told that the literal translation of it is not to what good end that is what is the good of it but who benefited the former rendering is not an absolutely impossible one on the principles of latin grammar which adds to the confusion but if that were its real meaning it would be indeed astonishing that it should have become a famous phrase the use of it instead of what is the good would be as silly and gratuitous as our above mentioned to the foot of the letter every scholar knows however that cui bono does deserve to be used in its true sense it is a shrewd and pregnant phrase like cherchez la femme or esprit d escalier cherchez la femme wraps up in itself a perhaps incorrect but still interesting theory of life that whenever anything goes wrong there is a woman at the bottom of it find her and all will be explained cui bono means as we said who benefited it is a roman lawyer s maxim who held that when you were at a loss to tell where the responsibility for a crime lay your best chance was to inquire who had reaped the benefit of it it has been worth while to devote a few lines to this phrase because nothing could better show at once what is worth transplanting into english and what dangers await any one who uses latin or french merely because he has a taste for ornament in the following quotation the meaning though most obscurely expressed is probably correct and cui bono stands for where can the story have come from why who will profit by a misunderstanding between italy and france germany of course so doubtless germany invented the story cui bono is quite capable of implying all that but a merciful writer will give his readers a little more help berlin the news which awakens the most hopeful interest is the story of a concession to a franco belgian syndicate in the harbour of tripoli there is a manifest desire that the statement should be confirmed and that it should have the effect of exciting the italian people and alienating them from france cui bono times it now only remains to add that there are french words good in some contexts and not in others r gime is good in the combination ancien r gime because that is the briefest way of alluding to the state of things in france before the revolution further its use in the first of the appended passages is appropriate enough because there is an undoubted parallel between russia now and france then but in the second administration ought to be the word throwing a flood of light upon the proceedings of the existing r gime in russia times he said that the goodwill and friendship of the milner r gime had resulted in the effective co operation of the two countries times the word employ is often a long ugly and unnatural substitute for men workmen or hands one of which should have been used in the first two of the passages below but it has a value where clerks or higher degrees are to be included as in the third passage it should be used as seldom as possible that is all the warehouses of the russian steamship company here have been set on fire by some dismissed employ s times the employ s of the trans caucasian line to day struck work times the new project article ordains that all employ s of the railways whatever their rank or the nature of their employment are to be considered as public officials times finally even words that have not begun to be naturalized may be used exceptionally when a real point can be gained by it to say chasseur instead of sportsman gun or other english word is generally ridiculous but our english notion of the french sportsman right or wrong is that he sports not because he likes sport but because he likes the picturesque costumes it gives an excuse for consequently the word is quite appropriate in the following but the costume of the chasseurs green velvet very robin hoody had been most tasteful e f benson false ugly or needless formations as a natural link between this section and the last the practice of taking french words and spelling them as english may stand first with french words that fill a definite blank in english the time comes when that should be done if it can with some words it can not no one has yet seen his way to giving ennui an english look with dishabille on the other hand which appears in the dictionary with spellings to suit all tastes many attempts have been made this word however well illustrates the importance of one principle that should be observed in borrowing from french unless the need is a very crying one no word should be taken that offers serious difficulties of pronunciation in d shabill are at least two problems h and ll of which an englishman fights shy the consequence is that though its english history dates back some centuries it is very seldom heard in conversation no word not used in conversation becomes a true native and dishabille is therefore being gradually ousted by n glig which can be pronounced without fear as dishabille is really quite cut off from d shabill it is a pity it was not further deprived of its final e that would have encouraged us to call it dish abil and it might have made good its footing na vet is another word for which there is a clear use and though the englishman can pronounce it without difficulty if he chooses he generally does prefer doing without it altogether to attempting a precision that strikes him as either undignified or pretentious it is therefore to be wished that it might be disencumbered of its diaeresis its accent and its italics it is true that the first sight of naivety is an unpleasant shock but we ought to be glad that the thing has begun to be done and in speaking sacrifice our pride of knowledge and call it naivety the case of banality is very different in one sense it has a stronger claim than naivety its adjective banal being much older in english than na ve but the old use of banal is as a legal term connected with feudalism that use is dead and its second life is an independent one it is now a mere borrowing from french whether we are to accept it or not should be decided by whether we want it and with common commonplace trite trivial mean vulgar all provided with nouns which again can be eked out with truism and platitude a shift can surely be made without it it is one of those foreign feathers like intimism intimity femininity distinction and distinguished the last pair now banalities if anything was ever banal so do extremes meet in which writers of literary criticism love to parade and which ordinary persons should do their best to pluck from them protesting when there is a chance and at all times refusing the compliment of imitation but perhaps the word that the critics would most of all delight their readers by forgetting is meticulous before adding an example or two we draw attention to the danger of accidentally assimilating a good english word to a french one amende is good french amends is good english but amend noun is neither triviality and over childishness and naivety h sweet agrippa himself was primarily a paradox monger many of his successors were in dead earnest and their repetition of his ingenuities becomes banal in the extreme bercher himself can by no means be acquitted of this charge of banality times it is significant that the only authorities for banality in the oxford dictionary are sala saintsbury dowden and browning but the volume is dated and though the word is still used in the same overpowering proportion by literary critics as opposed to other writers its total use has multiplied a hundredfold since then our hope is that the critics may before long feel that it is as banal to talk about banality as it is now felt by most wellbred people to be vulgar to talk about vulgarity his style which is pleasant and diffuse without being distinguished is more suited to the farm and the simple country life than to the complexities of the human character times his character and that of his wife are sketched with a certain distinction times and yet to look back over the whole is to feel that in one case only has she really achieved that perfection of intimism which is her proper goal times the reference to the english nonconformists was a graceful amend to them for being so passionate an oxonian and churchman morley and in her presentation of the mode of life of the respectable middle classes the most meticulous critic will not easily catch her tripping times formations involving grammatical blunders of these the possibilities are of course infinite we must assume that our readers know the ordinary rules of grammar and merely not to pass over the point altogether give one or two typical and not too trite instances my landlady entered bearing what she called her best lamp alit corelli this seems to be formed as a past participle from to alight in the sense of to kindle it will surprise most people to learn that there is or was such a verb not only was there but the form that should have been used in our sentence alight is probably by origin the participle of it the oxford dictionary however after saying this observes that it has now been assimilated to words like afire formed from the preposition a and a noun whether those two facts are true of not it is quite certain that there is no such word as alit in the sense of lighted or lit and that the use of it in our days is a grammatical blunder but every year pleaded stronger and stronger for the earl s conception j r green comparative adverbs of this type must be formed only from those positive adverbs which do not use

that underlaid the even voice of the breakers along the sea front kipling lie and lay have cost us all some perplexity in childhood the distinction is more difficult in the compounds with over and under because in them lie is transitive as well as lay but in a different sense any one who is not sure that he is sound on the point by instinct must take the trouble to resolve them into lie over or lay over c which at once clears up the doubt a mistake with the simple verb is surprising when made as in the following by a writer on grammar i met a lad who took a paper from a package that he carried and thrust it into my unwilling hand i suspected him of having laid in wait for the purpose r g white a confusion perhaps between lay wait and lie in wait i am not sure that yours and my efforts would suffice separately but yours and mine together can not possibly fail the first yours is quite wrong it should be your this mistake is common the absolute possessives ours and yours hers mine and thine with which the poetic or euphonic use of the last two before vowels has nothing to do are to be used only as pronouns or as predicative adjectives not as attributes to an expressed and following noun that they were used by old writers as in our example is irrelevant the correct modern usage has now established itself we add three sentences from burke the relation between no and none is the same as that between your and yours in the first sentence modern usage would write as the correct no or but a few is uncomfortable either few or no or few if any or no rays or but a few for the second we might possibly tolerate to their as well as to your own or we might write to their crown as well as to your own the third is quite tolerable as it is but any one who does not like the sound can write and their ancestors and ours it must always be remembered in this as in other constructions that the choice is not between a well sounding blunder and an ill sounding correctness but between an ill and a well sounding correctness the blunder should be ruled out and if the first form of the correct construction that presents itself does not sound well another way of putting it must be looked for patience will always find it the flexibility gained by habitual selection of this kind which a little cultivation will make easy and instinctive is one of the most essential elements in a good style for a more important illustration of the same principle the remarks on the gerund in the syntax chapter p may be referred to black bodies reflecting none or but a few rays burke you altered the succession to theirs as well as to your own crown burke they and we and their and our ancestors have been happy under that system burke formations violating analogy and then it is its panache its careless a moral renaissance romance times but she is perfectly natural and while perfectly amoral no more immoral than a bird or a kitten times a not is greek moral is latin it is at least desirable that in making new words the two languages should not be mixed the intricate needs of science may perhaps be allowed to override a literary principle of this sort and accordingly the oxford dictionary recognizes that a is compounded with latin words in scientific and technical terms as a sexual but purely literary workers may be expected to abstain the obvious excuse for this formation is that the latin negative prefix is already taken up in immoral which means contrary to morality while a word is wanted to mean unconcerned with morality but with non freely prefixed to adjectives in english though not in latin there can be no objection to non moral the second of our instances is a few weeks later than the first and the hyphen has disappeared so quickly has the times convinced itself that amoral is a regular english word there was no social or economic jealousy between them no racial aversion times concessions which besides damaging hungary by raising racial and language questions of

might well be avoided except in the rare cases where race and coast used adjectivally will not do the work they would in the present instances and they should not be made precedents for new formations if language is better than linguistic much more race than racial similarly river than riverine what she was pleased to term their superior intelligence and more real and reliable probity c bront villette it is absurd at this time of day to make a fuss about the word it is with us and will remain with us whatever pedants and purists may say in such cases obsta principiis is the only hope reliable might once have been suppressed perhaps it can not now but it is so fought over even to day that a short discussion of it may be looked for the objection to it is obvious you do not rely a thing therefore the thing can not be reliable it should be rely on able like come at able some of the analogies pleaded for it are perhaps irrelevant as laughable available for these may be formed from the nouns laugh avail since able is not only gerundival capable of being laughed at but also adjectival connected with a laugh this has certainly happened with seasonable but that will not help reliable which by analogy should be relianceable it is more to the point to remark that with reliable must go dispensable with indispensable and dependable both quite old words and disposable in its commoner sense no one as far as we know objects to these and others like them reliable is made into a scapegoat the word itself moreover besides its wide popularity is now of respectable antiquity dating at least from coleridge it may be added that it is probably to the campaign against it that we owe such passive monstrosities as ready to be availed of for available which is as we said possibly not open to the same objection as reliable i have heretofore designated the misuse of certain words as briticisms r g white britannic britannicism british britishism britic needless though correct formations the sordor and filths of nature the sun shall dry up emerson as candeo candor ardeo ardor so we are to understand sordeo sordor the romans however never felt that they needed the word and it is a roundabout method first to present them with a new word and then to borrow it from them for it will be observed that we have no living suffix or in english nor if we had anything nearer than sordid to attach it to perhaps emerson thought sordor was a latin word merely nodding his head as an enjoinder to be careful dickens as rejoin rejoinder so enjoin enjoinder the word is not given in the oxford dictionary from which it seems likely that dickens invented it consciously or unconsciously the only objection to such a word is that its having had to wait so long in spite of its obviousness before being made is a strong argument against the necessity of it we may regret that injunction holds the field having a much less english appearance but it does and in language the old established that can still do the work is not to be turned out for the new fangled that might do it a shade better but must first get itself known and accepted oppositely the badness of a walk that is shuffling and an utterance that is indistinct is alleged spencer this on the other hand is an archaism now obsolete why it should not have lived is a mystery but it has not and to write it is to give one s sentence the air of an old curiosity shop again as if to intensate the influences that are not of race what we think of when we talk of english traits really narrows itself to a small district emerson a favourite with those allied experimenters in words emerson and carlyle a word meaning to make intense is necessary and there are plenty of parallels for this particular form but coleridge had already made intensify introducing it with an elaborate apology in which he confessed that it sounded uncouth it is uncouth no longer if it had never existed perhaps intensate would now have been so no longer uncouthness being both etymologically and otherwise a matter of strangeness as against familiarity it is better to form words only where there is a clear demand for them long and short rivals the following examples illustrate a foolish tendency from the adjective perfect we form the verb to perfect and from that again the noun perfection to take a further step forward to a verb to perfection instead of returning to the verb to perfect is a superfluity of naughtiness from the noun sense we make the adjective sensible it is generally quite needless to go forward to sensibleness instead of back to our original noun sense to quieten is often used by hasty writers who have not time to remember that quiet is a verb with ex tempore ready to serve either as adverb or as adjective why make extemporaneous or extemporaneously as to contumacity the writer was probably unaware that contumacy existed contumacity might be formed from contumax like audacity from audax the romans had only the short forms audacia contumacia which should have given us audacy as well as contumacy but because our ancestors burdened themselves with an extra syllable in one we need not therefore do so

immovability of the judges times merely ugly formations bureaucracy the termination cracy is now so freely applied that it is too late to complain of this except on the ground of ugliness it may be

be added that to really established adverbs of this form as advisedly assuredly hurriedly there is no objection whatever but new ones are ugly slang the place of slang is in real life there an occasional indulgence in it is an almost necessary concession to our gregarious humanity he who declines altogether to let his speech be influenced by his neighbours tricks and takes counsel only of pure reason is setting up for more than man awfully nice is an expression than which few could be sillier but to have succeeded in going through life without saying it a certain number of times is as bad as to have no redeeming vice further the writer who deals in conversation may sometimes find it necessary by way of characterizing his speakers to put slang in their mouths if he is wise he will make the least possible use of this resource and to interlard the non conversational parts of a book or article with slang quotation marks or no quotation marks is as bad as interlarding with french foreign words and slang are as spurious ornaments on the same level the italics but not the quotation marks in these examples are ours when the madness motif was being treated on the stage shakespeare

does not know the difference between slang and good english and sins in ignorance when they are he is telling us i know it is naughty but then it is nice most of us would rather be taken for knaves than for fools and so the quotation marks are usually there with this advice never to use slang except in dialogue and there as little as may be we might leave the subject except that the suggestion we have made about the unconscious use of slang seems to require justifying to justify it we must attempt some analysis however slight of different sorts of slang to the ordinary man of average intelligence and middle class position slang comes from every direction from above from below and from all sides as well as from the centre what comes from some directions he will know for slang what comes from others he may not he may be expected to recognize words from below some of these are shortenings by the lower classes of words whose full form conveys no clear meaning and is therefore useless to them an antiquated example is mob for mobile vulgus that was once slang and is now good english a modern one is bike which will very likely be good english also in time but though its brevity is a strong recommendation and its uncouthness probably no more than subjective and transitory it is as yet slang such words should not be used in print till they have become so familiar that there is not the slightest temptation to dress them up in quotation marks though they are the most easily detected they are also the best slang when the time comes they take their place in the language as words that will last and not like many of the more highly descended words die away uselessly after a brief popularity another set of words that may be said to come from below since it owes its existence to the vast number of people who are incapable of appreciating fine shades of meaning is exemplified by nice awful blooming words of this class fortunately never make their way in their slang senses into literature except of course dialogue the abuse of nice has gone on at any rate for over a century the curious reader may find an interesting page upon it in the fourteenth chapter of northanger abbey but even now we do not talk in books of a nice day only of a nice distinction on the other hand the slang use makes us shy in different degrees of writing the words in their legitimate sense a nice distinction we write almost without qualms an awful storm we think twice about and as to a blooming girl we hardly venture it nowadays the most recent sufferer of this sort is perhaps chronic it has been adopted by the masses as far apart at least as in yorkshire and in london for a mere intensive in the sense of remarkable the next step is for it to be taken up in parody by people who know better after which it may be expected to succeed awful so much for the slang from below the ordinary man can detect it he is not so infallible about what comes to him from above we are by no means sure that we shall be correct in our particular attribution of the half dozen words now to be mentioned but it is safe to say that they are all at present enjoying some vogue as slang and that they all come from regions that to most of us are overhead phenomenal soon we hope to perish unregretted is at least indirectly through the abuse of phenomenon from metaphysics immanence a

the upper classes psychological moment from science thrasonical and cryptic from academic circles philistine from the region of culture among these the one that will be most generally allowed to be slang cad is in fact the least so it has by this time like mob passed its probation and taken its place as an orthodox word so that all who do not find adequate expression for their feelings in the orthodox have turned away to bounder and other forms that still admit the emphasis of quotation marks as for the rest of them they are being subjected to that use at once over frequent and inaccurate which produces one kind of slang but the average man seeing from what exalted quarters they come is dazzled into admiration and hardly knows them for what they are by the slang that comes from different sides or from the centre we mean especially the many words taken originally from particular professions pursuits or games but extended beyond them among these a man is naturally less

and both these words as well as individual which must be treated more at length in the next section are illustrations of a tendency that we have called polysyllabic humour and discussed in the chapter airs and graces we now add a short list of slang phrases or words that can most of them be referred with more or less of certainty to particular occupations whether they are recognized as slang will certainly depend in part on whether the occupation is familiar though sometimes the familiarity will disguise and sometimes it will bring out the slanginess to hedge the double event turf frontal

sufficient occasions will arise rarely for using most of these phrases and the rest of the slang vocabulary to those however who desire that what they write may endure it is suggested that as style is

individual which almost made the fortune of many a victorian humorist is one of the modern editor s shibboleths for detecting the unfit and even those who regard only the present will do well to

he asserts that about four years ago there was quite an argentine boom in new zealand times no treatment of slang however short should omit the reminder that slang and idiom are hard to distinguish and yet in literature slang is bad and idiom good we said that slang was perishable the fact is that most of it perishes but some survives and is given the idiomatic franchise when it doth prosper none dare call it slang the idiomatic writer differs chiefly from the slangy in using what was slang and is now idiom of what is still slang he chooses only that part which his insight assures him has the sort of merit that will preserve it in a small part of their vocabulary the idiomatic and the slangy will coincide and be therefore confused by the undiscerning the only advice that can be given to novices uncertain of their own discrimination is to keep carefully off the debatable ground full idiom and full slang are as far apart as virtue and vice and yet they oft so mix the difference is

therefore two courses open to him he may leave the word alone or he may find out what it means if he insists on using it without finding out he will commit himself the adjectival use of it presents no difficulty the adjective as well as the adverb individually is always used rightly if at all it is the noun that goes wrong an individual is not simply a person it is a single separate or private person a person as opposed to a combination of persons this qualification this opposition must be effectively present to the mind or the word is not in place in the nineteenth especially the early nineteenth century this distinction was neglected mainly under the impulse of polysyllabic humour the word which does mean person in some sort of way was seized upon as a facetious substitute for it not only that it spread even to good writers who had no facetious intention it became the kind of slang described in the last section which is highly popular until it suddenly turns disgusting in reading many of these writers we feel that we must make allowances for them on this point they only failed to be right when every one else was wrong but we if we do it sin against the light to leave no possible doubt about the distinction we shall give many examples divided into right uses wrong uses sentences in which though the author has used the word rightly a perverse reader might take it

prove the contrast with bodies or organizations to have been present to the writer s mind though it may often happen that he does not actually show it by specific mention of them on the other hand in

mutual requires caution as with individual any one who is not prepared to clear his ideas upon its meaning will do well to avoid it it is a very telltale word readily convicting the unwary and on the other hand it may quite easily be done without every one knows by now that our mutual friend is a solecism mutual implies an action or relation between two or more persons or things a doing or standing to b as b does or stands to a let a and b be the persons indicated by our c the friend no such reciprocal relation is here implied between a and b who for all we know may be enemies but only a separate though similar relation between each of them and c there is no such thing as a mutual friend in the singular but the phrase mutual friends may without nonsense be used to describe either a and c b and c or if a and b happen to be also friends a and b and c our mutual friend is nonsense mutual friends though not nonsense is bad english because it is tautological it takes two to make a friendship as to make a quarrel and therefore all friends are mutual friends and friends alone means as much as mutual friends mutual wellwishers on the other hand is good english as well as good sense because it is possible for me to be a man s wellwisher though he hates me mutual love understanding insurance benefits dislike mutual benefactors backbiters abettors may all be correct though they are also sometimes used incorrectly like our mutual friend where the right word would be common further it is to be carefully observed that the word mutual is an equivalent in meaning and sometimes a convenient one for grammatical reasons of the pronoun each other with various prepositions to use it as well as each other is even more clearly tautological than the already mentioned

friend is wrong the relation is not one between a and b it is only that a and b hold separately the same relation to c the meeting it should be common desire if desire is here equivalent to request

paradise lost and vanity fair to paradise lost by vanity fair or paradise lost was lent to vanity fair by vanity fair and vanity fair to paradise lost by paradise lost this may be considered captious but we still wish the author had said either they lent each other books or books were lent by them to each other a thing is unique or not unique there are no degrees of uniqueness nothing is ever somewhat or rather unique though many things are almost or in some respects unique the word is a member of a depreciating series singular had once the strong meaning that unique has still in accurate but not in other writers in consequence of slovenly use singular no longer means singular but merely remarkable it is worn out before long rather unique will be familiar unique that is will be worn out in turn and we shall have to resort to unexampled and keep that clear of qualifications as long as we can happily it is still admitted that sentences like the three given below are solecisms they contain a self contradiction for the other regrettable use of unique as when the advertisement columns offer us what they call unique opportunities it may generally be assumed with safety that they

an aggravating circumstance was that the snow was dirty the meaning is not that the dirt was annoying but that it added to some other misery previously expressed or implied but as the dirt happens to be annoying also this use is easily misunderstood and is probably the origin of the notorious vulgarism since it almost inevitably lays a writer open to suspicion it is best avoided of the following

three called subjective objective possessive in nouns the first two are indistinguishable and are called the common case one result of this simplicity is that the sense of case being almost lost the few mistakes that can be made are made often some of them so often that they are now almost right by prescription in apposition a pronoun appended to a noun and in the same relation to the rest of the sentence should be in the same case disregard of this is a bad blunder but to behold her mother she to whom she owed her being s ferrier the complement with am are is c should be subjective i am she

but one him would no doubt have been defended by the writer since the full form would be he whom as an attraction to the vanished whom but such attraction is not right if he alone is felt to be uncomfortable whom should not be omitted or in this exalted context it might be he that on that s him see below when a verb or preposition governs two pronouns united by and c the second is apt to go

casket quite out of reach of you or i s ferrier she found everyone s attention directed to mary and she herself entirely overlooked s ferrier the interrogative who is often used for whom as who did you see a distinction should here be made between conversation written or spoken and formal writing many educated people feel that in saying it is i whom do you mean instead of it s me who do you mean they will be talking like a book and they justifiably prefer geniality to grammar but in print unless it is dialogue the correct forms are advisable even with words that have no visible distinction between subjective and objective case it is possible to go wrong for the case can always be inferred though not seen consequently a word should never be so placed that it must be taken twice once as subject and once as object this is so common a blunder that it will be well to give a good number of examples it occurs especially with the relative from its early position in the sentence but as the first two examples show it may result from the exceptional placing of other words also the mere repetition of the relative or insertion of it or other pronoun generally mends the sentence in the first

of which no authority could add or take away one jot or tittle huxley to is applicable to add not to take away the full form is given by substituting for or and from the certainty of which no authority could this is clearly too cumbrous inserting or from after to is the simplest correction but the result is rather formal better perhaps the certainty of which could not be increased or diminished one jot by any authority from his conversation i should have pronounced him to be fitted to excel in whatever walk of ambition he had chosen to exert his abilities a second in is required this common slovenliness results from the modern superstition against putting a preposition at the end the particular sentence may however be mended otherwise than by inserting in if excel is made absolute by a comma placed after it even then the in would perhaps be better at the end of the clause than at the beginning lastly may be mentioned a principle upon which clausewitz insisted with all his strength and could never sufficiently impress upon his royal scholar times the italicized upon we have nothing to do with the other upon is right with insist but wrong though it must necessarily be supplied again with impress it is the result of the same superstition mend either by writing upon after insisted instead of before which or by inserting which he after and after as and than these are properly conjunctions and take the same case after them as before but those words must be rightly understood a i love you more than him means something different from b i love you more than he it must be borne in mind that the case before is that of the word that is compared with the case after and not necessarily that of the word actually next before in position in a you is compared with him in b i not you is compared with he the correct usage is therefore important and the tendency illustrated in the following examples to make than and as prepositions should be resisted though no ambiguity can actually result here when such as her die swift but there i think lindore would be more eloquent than me s ferrier it must further be noticed that both as and than are conjunctions of the sort that can either like and c merely join coordinates or like when c attach a subordinate clause to what it depends on this double power sometimes affects case it is to him and such men as he that we owe the change huxley this example is defensible as being here a subordinating conjunction and as he being equivalent to as he is but it is distinctly felt to need defence which as him would not as would be a coordinating conjunction and simply join the pronoun him to the noun men so with than such as have bound me as well as others much better than me by an inviolable attachment to him from that time forward burke on the other hand we could not say indifferently i am as good as he and i am as good as him the latter would imply that as was a preposition which it is not and it is not always possible to choose between the coordinating and the subordinating use in the next example only the coordinating will do no verb being capable of standing after he but the author has not observed this i beheld a man in the dress of a postillion whom i instantly recognized as he to whom i had rendered assistance borrow a difficult question however arises with relatives after than in the next two examples whom is as manifestly wrong as who is manifestly intolerable dr dillon than whom no englishman has a profounder acquaintance with times it was a pleasure to hear canon liddon than whom in his day there was no finer preacher the only correct solution is to recast the sentences for instance whose acquaintance with is unrivalled among englishmen and unsurpassed in his day as a preacher but perhaps the convenience of than whom is so great that to rule it out amounts to saying that man is made for grammar and not grammar for man compound possessives this is strictly the proper place for drawing attention to a question that has some importance because it bears on the very common construction discussed at some length in the gerund section this is the question whether and to what extent compound possessives may be recognized some people say some one else s others say some one s else our own opinion is that the latter is uncalled for and pedantic of the three alternatives smith the baker s wife smith s wife the baker the wife of smith the baker the last is unmitigated ollendorff the second thrusts its ambiguity upon us and provokes an involuntary smile and the first alone is felt to be natural it must be confessed however that it is generally avoided in print while the form that we have ventured to call pedantic is not uncommon in the first of the

london times comparatives and superlatives the chief point that requires mention is ill treatment of the more in this phrase the is not the article but an adverb either relative or demonstrative in the more the merrier it is first relative and then demonstrative by how much we are more by so much we shall be merrier when the relative the is used it should always be answered regularly by or itself answer the demonstrative the attempts to vary the formula are generally unhappy for instance he was leaving his english business in the hands of bilton who seemed to him the more he knew him extraordinarily efficient e f benson this should run perhaps whose efficiency impressed him the more the more he knew him though it must be confessed that the double form is nearly always uncomfortable if it has not the elbowroom of a whole sentence to itself that however is rather a question of style than of syntax and other examples will accordingly be found in the section of the chapter airs and graces concerned with originality the farther we advance into it we see confusion more and more unfold itself into order carlyle most readers will feel that this is an uncomfortable compromise between the farther we advance the more do we see and as we advance we see confusion more and more unfold itself similarly she had reflection enough to foresee that the longer she countenanced his passion her own heart would be more and more irretrievably engaged smollett but it is when the demonstrative is used alone with no corresponding relative clause a use in itself quite legitimate that real blunders occur it seems sometimes to be thought that the more is merely a more imposing form of more and is therefore better suited for a dignified or ambitious style but it has in fact a perfectly definite meaning or rather two and there need never be any doubt whether more or the more is right one of the meanings is a slight extension of the other the correlative meaning by so much may be kept though the relative clause instead of formally corresponding and containing the meaning by how much and a comparative takes some possibly quite different shape but it must still be clear from the context what the relative clause might be thus we shall be a huge crowd well we shall be the merrier or if he raises his demands i grant them the more willingly i e the more he asks the more willingly i give this instance leads to the other possible meaning which is wider the original meaning of the demonstrative the is simply by that this in the complete double form and often elsewhere has the interpretation limited to quantity of by so much or in that proportion but it may also mean on that account when the relative clause is not present again however the context must answer plainly in some form the question on what account thus he has done me many good turns but i do not like him any the better i e any better on that account i e on account of the good turns the function of the then is to tell us that there is just before or after an answer to one of the questions more by what amount more on what account if there is no such answer we may be sure that the comparative has no right to its the we start with a sentence that is entitled to its the but otherwise unidiomatic we are not a whit the less depressed in spirits at the sight of all this unrelieved misery on the stage by the reminder that euripides was moved to depict it by certain occurrences in his own contemporary athens times the less is less on that account viz that we are reminded but the preposition required when the cause is given in this construction by a noun is for not by read for the reminder the type is shown in none the better for seeing you our sentence is in fact a mixture between our depression is not lessened by the reminder and we are not the less depressed for the reminder and the confusion is the worse that depressed by happens to be a common phrase the suggestion as regarded mr sowerby was certainly true and was not the less so as regarded some of mr sowerby s friends trollope the tells us that we can by looking about us find an answer either to not less true by what amount or to not less true on what account there is no answer to the first except not less true about the friends in proportion as it was truer about mr sowerby and none to the second except not less true about the friends because it was true about mr sowerby both are meaningless and the the is superfluous and wrong yet as his criticism is more valuable than that of other men so it is the more rarely met with spectator this is such an odd tangle of the two formulae as so the more the more that the reader is tempted to cut the knot and imagine what is hardly possible that the is meant for the ordinary article agreeing with kind of criticism understood between the and more otherwise it must be cured either by omitting the or by writing the more valuable his criticism the more rarely is it met with if the latter is done than that of other men will have to go which suggests the further observation that the with a comparative is almost always wrong when a than clause is appended this is because in the full double clause there is necessarily not a fixed standard of comparison but a sliding scale the following example not complicated by any the will make the point clear my eyes are more and more averse to light than ever s ferrier you can be more averse than ever or more and more averse but not more and more averse than ever ever can only mean the single point of time in the past whichever it was at which you were most averse but to be more and more averse is to be more averse at each stage than at each previous stage just such a sliding scale is essential with the more the more and perhaps it becomes so closely associated with the phrase that the expression of a fixed standard of comparison such as is inevitably set up by a than clause is felt to be impossible even when the demonstrative the stands alone in the next two examples answers to the question more on what account can be found though they are so far disguised that the sentences would be uncomfortable even if what makes them impossible were absent that is the addition of the than clause in each but neither is that way open nor is it any the more open in the case of canada than australia f greenwood the the might pass if than australia were omitted and there would be no objection to it if we read further for in the case if we take the case and better still placed that clause first in the sentence nor if we take the case of canada is the way any the more open the then means on that account viz because we have substituted canada i would humbly protest against setting up any standard of christianity by the regularity of people s attendance at church or chapel i am certain personally that i have a far greater realization of the goodness of god to all creation i am certain that i can the more acknowledge his unbounded love for all he has made and our entire dependence on him than i could twenty years ago when i attended church ten times where i now go once daily telegraph in this the answer to more on what account is possibly implied in the last clause it would perhaps be if clearly put because i go to church seldomer the right form would be i can the more acknowledge for going or that i go to church only once where twenty years ago i went ten times unless the than clause is got rid of we ought to have more without the this question of the is important for lucidity is rather difficult and has therefore had to be treated at length the other points that call for mention are quite simple they are illogicalities licensed by custom but perhaps better avoided avoidance however that proclaims itself is not desirable to set readers asking who are you pray that the things everybody says are not good enough for you is bad policy in vitium ducit culpae fuga si caret arte but if a way round presents itself that does not at once suggest an assumption of superiority so much the better more than i can help without thinking of the corresponding phrase in his native language more than he can help h sweet we don t haul guns through traffic more than we can help kipling these really mean of course more than he we can not help to say that however is by this time

home service army is a most ideal and obvious solution admits i think of no contradiction times relatives a defining and non defining relative clauses for the purposes of b and c below all relative clauses are divided into defining and non defining the exact sense in which we use these terms is illustrated by the following groups of which i contains defining clauses ii non defining i the man who called yesterday left no address mr lovelace has seen divers apartments at windsor but not one he says that he thought fit for me richardson he secured her sincere regard by the feelings which he manifested thackeray the jones who dines with us to night is not the jones who was at school with you the best novel that trollope ever wrote was any man that knows three words of greek could settle that point ii at the first meeting which was held yesterday the chair deputies must be elected by the zemstvos which must be extended and popularized but not on the basis of times the emperor william who was present listened to a loyal address times the statue of the emperor frederick which is the work of the sculptor professor uphnes represents the monarch on horseback times jones who should know something of the matter thinks differently the function of a defining relative clause is to limit the application of the antecedent where that is already precise a defining clause is not wanted the limitation can be effected in more than one way according to the nature of the antecedent as a rule the antecedent gives us a class to select from the defining clause enables us to make the selection thus in our first example the antecedent leaves us to select from the general class of men the defining clause fixes the particular man presumably the only man or the only man that would occur in the connexion who called yesterday sometimes however the functions of the two are reversed when we have an antecedent with a superlative or other word of exclusive or comprehensive meaning such as all only any we know already how to make our selection and only wait for the relative clause to tell us from what class to make it we know that we are to choose the best novel the relative clause limits us to the works of trollope we are to choose any man we like provided says our relative clause that he knows three words of greek in either case the work of definition is done by the exclusion implied in the relative clause of persons or things that the antecedent by itself might be taken to include the point to notice is that whichever way the defining clause does its work it is essential to and inseparable from its antecedent if for any reason we wish to get rid of it we can only do so by embodying its contents in the antecedent the man in paris with whom i correspond must become my paris correspondent to remove the clause altogether is to leave the antecedent with either no meaning or a wrong one even in such extreme cases as the wisest man that ever lived the meanest flower that blows where the defining clause may seem otiose and therefore detachable we might claim that future wise men and past and future flowers are excluded but we shall better realize the writer s intention if we admit that these clauses are only a pretence of limitation designed to exclude the reality it is as if the writers invited to set limits to their statements had referred us respectively to time and space this fact that the removal of a defining clause destroys the meaning of the antecedent supplies an infallible test for distinguishing between the defining and the non defining clause the latter can always the former never be detached without disturbing the truth of the main predication a non defining clause gives independent comment description explanation anything but limitation of the antecedent it can always be rewritten either as a parenthesis or as a separate sentence and this is true however essential the clause may be to the point of the main statement jones in our last example above is quoted chiefly as one who should know something of the matter but this need not prevent us from writing jones thinks differently and he should know something of the matter to find then whether a clause defines or does not define remove it and see whether the statement of which it formed a part is unaltered if not the clause defines this test can be applied without difficulty to all the examples given above it is true that we sometimes get ambiguous cases after removing the relative clause we can not always say whether the sense has been altered or not that means however not that our test has failed but that the clause is actually capable of performing either function and that the main sentence can bear two distinct meanings between which even context may not enable us to decide the point is illustrated in different degrees by the following examples mr h lewis then brought forward an amendment which had been put down by mr trevelyan and which provided for an extension of the process of income tax graduation times this was held to portend developments that somehow or other have not followed times the former of these is quite ambiguous the bringing forward of an amendment no matter what or whose may be all that the writer meant to tell us of in the first instance the relative clauses are then non defining clauses of description on the other hand both clauses may quite well be meant to define and it is even possible that the second is meant to define and the first not though the coordination is then of a kind that we shall show under c to be improper similarly in the second sentence to portend developments may possibly be complete in itself the whole might then be paraphrased thus it was thought that the matter would not stop there but it has more probably the clause is meant to define it was held to portend what have since proved to be unrealized developments this view is confirmed as we shall see both by the use of that not which and by the absence of a comma before it punctuation is a test that would not always be applicable even if all writers could be assumed to punctuate correctly but it is often a guide to the writer s intention for a non defining clause should always be separated from the antecedent by a stop a defining clause should never be so separated unless it is either preceded by a parenthesis indicated by stops or coordinated with a former defining clause or with adjectives belonging to the antecedent as in the following examples the only circumstance in fact that could justify such a course it is he only who does this who follows them into all their force and matchless grace that does or can feel their full value hazlitt perfect types that satisfy all these requirements are not to be looked for it will occur to the reader that our last two examples are strictly speaking exceptions to the rule of defining clauses since they tell us only what is already implied and could therefore be removed without impairing the sense that is true to some extent of many parallel defining clauses they are admissible however if without actually giving any limitation themselves they make more clear a limitation already given or implied if in fact they are offered as alternative versions or as reminders our next example is of a defining clause of the same kind this estimate which he gives is the great groundwork of his plan for the national redemption burke the limitation given by this is repeated in another form by the relative clause this estimate the one he gives is the reader should bear in mind that the distinction between the two kinds of relative is based entirely on the closeness of their relation to the antecedent the information given by a defining clause must be taken at once with the antecedent or both are useless that given by a non defining clause will keep indefinitely the clause being complete in sense without the antecedent and the antecedent without the clause this is the only safe test to ask for instance whether the clause conveys comment explanation or the like is not a sufficient test unless the question is rightly understood for although we have said that a non defining clause conveys comment and the like as opposed to definition of the antecedent it does not follow that a defining clause may not while defining its own antecedent contribute towards comment on the contrary it is often open to a writer to throw his comment into such a form as will include a defining clause it may even appear from a comparison of the two sentences below that this is the origin of the non defining clause being an abbreviation of lewis a man to whom hard work never came amiss sifted the question thoroughly lewis to whom hard work never came amiss sifted the question in a comment is introduced by a man in apposition with lewis a man is antecedent to a defining relative clause separate them and the antecedent is meaningless but next remove the connecting words a man and the relative changes at once its antecedent and its nature the antecedent is lewis the relative is non defining and the clause is a comment and does not merely contribute to one b that and who or which that is evidently regarded by many writers as nothing more than an ornamental variation for who and which to be used not indeed immoderately but quite without discrimination the opinion is excusable it is not easy to draw any distinction that is at all consistently supported by usage there was formerly a tendency to use that for everything the tendency now is to use who and which for everything that from disuse has begun to acquire an archaic flavour which with some authors is a recommendation de quincey for one must certainly have held that in exalted prose that in all connexions was the more dignified relative his higher flights abound in curious uses of the word some instances of which are quoted below this confusion is to be regretted for although no distinction can be authoritatively drawn between the two relatives an obvious one presents itself the few limitations on that and who about which every one is agreed all point to that as the defining relative who or which as the non defining we can not say my father that left berlin last night will shortly arrive and an examination of instances would show that we can never use that where the clause is unmistakably non defining on the other hand we can not say all which i can do is useless this time it is true the generalization will not hold which can and sometimes must be used and who commonly is used in defining clauses but that is explained partly by the obvious inconvenience sometimes attending the use of that and partly by the general tendency to exclude it from regular use which has already resulted in making it seem archaic when used of persons except in certain formulae the rules given below are a modification of this principle that that is the defining who or which the non defining relative the reason for each modification is given in its place we must here remind the reader of the distinction drawn in a between defining and non defining clauses a defining clause limits the application of the antecedent enabling us to select from the whole class to which the antecedent is applicable the particular individual or individuals meant that should never be used to introduce a non defining clause it is therefore improperly used in all the following examples but by her side was kneeling her better angel that hid his face with wings that wept and pleaded for her that prayed

preferred to who are those mentioned above as particularly requiring that instead of which those namely in which the antecedent is it or has attached to it a superlative or other word of exclusive

have been noticed that all the relatives in were either in the subjective case or in the objective without a preposition that has no possessive case and can not take a preposition before it accordingly the man that i found the hat of will of course give place to the man whose hat i found and the house in which this happened will generally be preferred to the house that this happened in the latter tendency is modified in the spoken language by the convenient omission of that for always in a defining clause though never in a non defining a relative in the objective case with or without a preposition can be dropped but few writers like as a general rule either to drop their relatives or to put prepositions at the end the friends i was travelling with the book i got it from the place i found it in will therefore usually appear as the friends with whom i was travelling the book from which i got it the place in which i found it euphony demands that that that should become that which even when the words are separated and many writers from a feeling that which is the natural correlative of the demonstrative that prefer the plural those which but the first example quoted in seems to show that those that can be quite unobjectionable a certain awkwardness seems to attend the use of that when the relative is widely separated from its antecedent when for instance two relative clauses are coordinate some writers use that in the first which in the second clause though both define this point will be illustrated in c where we shall notice that inconsistency in this respect sometimes obscures the sense it may seem to the reader that a rule with so many exceptions to it is not worth observing we would remind him i that it is based upon those palpable misuses of the relatives about which every one is agreed ii that of the exceptions the first and last result from and might disappear with the encroachment of who and the general vagueness about the relatives while the other two being obvious and clearly defined do not interfere with the remaining uses of that iii that if we are to be at the expense of maintaining two different relatives we may as well give each of them definite work to do in the following subsections we shall not often allude to the distinction here laid down the reader will find that our rules are quite as often violated as observed and may perhaps conclude that if the vital difference between a defining and a non defining clause were consistently marked wherever it is possible by a discriminating use of that and which false coordination and other mishandlings of the relatives would be less common than they are c and who and which the various possibilities of relative coordination right and wrong may be thus stated i a relative clause may be rightly or wrongly coordinated with another relative clause this we shall call open coordination ii it may be rightly or wrongly coordinated with words that are equivalent to a relative clause and for which a relative clause can be substituted latent coordination iii a clause that has obviously no coordinate open or latent may yet be introduced by and or other word implying coordination for such offenders which can not be coordinate and will not be subordinate insubordination is not too harsh a term the following are ordinary types of the three classes i men who are ambitious and whose ambition has never been thwarted pitt who was ambitious but whose ambition was qualified by ii ambitious men and whose ambition has never been thwarted an evil now alas beyond our power to remedy and for which we have to thank the folly of our predecessors iii being thus pressed he grudgingly consented at last to a redistribution and which i need not say it was his duty to have offered in the first instance a coordination in which and is the natural conjunction may also be indicated simply by a comma there is safety in this course since the clause following the comma may be either coordinate or subordinate but we have to deal only with clauses that are committed to coordination insubordination will not detain us long it is always due either to negligence or to gross ignorance we shall illustrate it in its place with a few examples but shall not discuss it with regard however to open and latent coordination opinions differ there is an optimist view of open coordination and a pessimist view of latent both of which seem to us incorrect it is held by some that open coordination provided that the relatives have the same antecedent is never wrong and by some not necessarily others that latent coordination is never right we shall endeavour to show that the former is often wrong and the latter however ungainly often right the essential to coordination is that the coordinates should be performing the same function in the sentence it is not necessary nor is it enough that they should be in the same grammatical form things of the same form may have different functions and things of different forms may have the same function if we say unambitious men and who have no experience unambitious and who have no experience are not in the same form but they have the same function that of specifying the class of men referred to their grammatical forms vocabulary permitting are interchangeable a defining adjective can always take the form of a relative clause and a defining relative clause can often take the form of an adjective inexperienced men and who have no ambition unambitious is therefore the true grammatical equivalent of who have no ambition and latent coordination between it and a relative clause is admissible on the other hand among things that have the same grammatical form but different functions are the defining and the non defining relative clause a non defining clause we know can be removed without disturbing the truth of the predication it has therefore no essential function it can not therefore have the same function as a defining clause whose function we know to be essential it follows that open coordination is not admissible between a defining and a non defining clause and generally coordination whether open or latent is admissible between two defining or two non defining coordinates but not between a defining and a non defining our object however in pointing out what seems to be the true principle of relative coordination is not by any means to encourage the latent variety it has seldom any advantage over full coordination it is perhaps more apt to lead to actual blunders it is usually awkward and it does violence needless violence as often as not to a very widespread and not unreasonable prejudice many writers may be suspected of using it against their better judgement merely for the purpose of asserting a right it is their natural protest against the wholesale condemnation of ignorant critics who do not see that latent coordination may be nothing worse than clumsy and that open coordination may be a gross blunder for the benefit of such critics it seems worth while to examine the correctness of various examples both open and latent on the other merits and demerits of the latent variety the reader will form his own judgement i open coordination a few minutes brought us to a large and busy bazaar with the localities of which the stranger appeared well acquainted and

destroyed merely by rolling down stones scott wrong the first clause defines the second not from doing this they were prevented by the disgraceful scene which took place and which the leader of the opposition took no steps to avert times wrong the first clause defines the second is obviously one of comment the scene is not distinguished from those that the leader did take steps to avert they propose that the buildings shall belong to the communes in which they stand and which it is hoped will not permit their desecration spectator wrong the communes that will not permit are not meant to

for the information which her husband had given her and which made her very grave thackeray all these are wrong thackeray would probably have been saved from these false coordinations if he had observed the distinction between that and which in the best french that he could muster which in sooth was there goes another sort of animal that is differentiating from my species and which i would gladly see exterminated h g wells probably the second clause like the first is meant to define if so the coordination is right if not it is wrong we have alluded to the tendency to avoid that when the relative is widely separated from its antecedent here the result is ambiguity and here he said in german what he wished to say and which was of no great importance and which i translated into english borrow wrong what that which defines the and which clauses do not ii latent coordination between relative clause and equivalent is seldom correct when the relative clause is non defining for the equivalent with few and undesirable exceptions is always a defining adjective or phrase and can be coordinate only with a defining clause the equivalent must of course be a true one capable that is of being converted into a relative clause without altering the effect of the sentence neglect of this restriction often results in false coordination especially in one particular type of sentence suppose that a historian after describing some national calamity proceeds in these distressing circumstances here we might seem to have two possible equivalents these and distressing first let us expand these into a relative clause in the distressing circumstances that i have described this in the context is a fair equivalent and as often as not would actually appear instead of these but next expand distressing in these circumstances which were distressing a non defining clause to this expansion no writer would consent it defeats the object for which distressing was placed before the antecedent that object was to record his own sensibility without disparaging the reader s by telling him in so many words as our relative clause does that the circumstances were distressing and it is secured by treating distressing not as a separate predication but as an inseparable part of the antecedent distressing it will be observed can not give us a defining clause it is obviously meant to be co extensive with these we are not to select from these circumstances those only that are distressing moreover as these although capable of appearing as a relative clause can scarcely require another relative clause to complete the limitation of the antecedent it follows that in sentences of this form coordination will generally be wrong we have examples in the cowper quotation below and in the anonymous one that precedes it juices ready prepared and which can be absorbed immediately huxley a deliberate attempt to frame and to verify general rules as to phenomena of all kinds and which can therefore be propagated by argument or persuasion l stephen rules that shall be general and that can a painful comprehensive survey of a very complicated matter and which requires a great variety of

cowper these are the instances of false expansion alluded to above the former is based on the non defining expansion in all its moods which are varied and capricious the true expansion being in all the varied and capricious moods in which it reveals itself a defining clause which will not do with the and which similarly the second is based on the non defining expansion in my uncle s present state which is an infirm one the true expansion is in the infirm state in which my uncle now is in both a non defining clause is coordinated with words that can only yield a defining clause previous

green if the writer means us to distinguish among the innovations introduced by the tudors those that had also been taken away the and which clause defines and the coordination is right but more probably the clause conveys independent information the coordination is then wrong the various arrangements of pueri puellam amabant all have the same meaning the boys loved the girl for puellam shows by its form that it must be the object of the action amabant must have for its subject a plural substantive and which must therefore be not puellam but pueri r g white wrong a plural substantive can yield only the defining clause a substantive that is plural now these words contain an inference from a general grammatical principle that a plural verb must have a plural subject and any supplementary defining clause must also be general not like the and which clause particular we might have for instance amabant being plural and finite must have for its subject a plural substantive and which is in the nominative case but the and which clause is evidently non defining the inference ends at substantive then comes the application of it to the particular case he refused to adopt the restrictive theory and impose a numerical limit on the bank s issues and which he again protested against in h d macleod wrong the and which clause is non defining none of the three possible antecedents theory limit imposition will give a non defining clause the great obstacle is the religion of europe and which has unhappily been colonially introduced into america beaconsfield this illustrates an important point of europe gives the defining clause that prevails in europe the coordination therefore requires that the and which clause should define now a defining clause must contain no word that is not meant to contribute to definition if then the and which clause defines the writer wishes to distinguish the religion in question not only from those european religions that have not been colonially introduced into america but also from those european religions that have been introduced but whose introduction is not a matter for regret that is the only defining meaning that unhappily can bear and unless we accept this interpretation the clause is non defining we shall allude to this sentence again in d where the possibilities of parenthesis in a defining clause are discussed it may seem strange that this important place should not have been conferred on vaca de castro already on the spot and who had shown himself so well qualified to fill it prescott one of our few and undesirable exceptions in which the clause equivalent is non defining who was already on the spot for a person s name can only require a defining clause to distinguish him from others of the

looks as if he has included the original men whom he desires should be in the country now times we feed children whom we think are hungry times the only gentlemen holding this office in the island whom he felt sure would work for the spiritual good of the parish guernsey advertiser these writers evidently think that in whom we think are hungry whom is the object of we think the relative is in fact the subject of are and the object of we know is the clause who are hungry the order of the words is a necessary result of the fact that a relative subject must stand at the beginning of its clause the same awkward necessity confronts us in clauses with when though c in which the subject is a relative such clauses are practically recognized as impossible though otway in a courageous moment wrote unblemished honour and a spotless love which tho perhaps now know another flame yet i have love and passion for their name some writers with a consistency worthy of a better cause carry the blunder into the passive renouncing the advantages of an ambiguous which in the active for in the active which of course tells no tales as to all this the trend of events has been the reverse of that which was anticipated would be the result of democratic institutions times which it was anticipated would be similarly the passive of men whom we know are honest is the impossible men who are known are honest men who we know are honest gives the correct passive men who it is known are honest nor must it be supposed that we know is parenthetic in non defining clauses jones who we know is honest we can regard the words as parenthetic if we choose except when the phrase is negative jones who i can not think is honest but in a defining clause they are anything but parenthetic when we say choose men who you know are honest the words you know add a new circumstance of limitation it is not enough that the men should in fact be honest you must know them to be honest honest men of whose honesty you are not certain are excluded by the words you know similarly in the guernsey advertiser quotation above the writer does not go the length of saying that these are the only gentlemen who would work he says that they are the only ones of whom he feels sure the commas of parenthesis ought therefore to go as well as the comma at island which is improper before a defining clause the circumstances under which a parenthesis is admissible in a defining clause may here be noticed i when the clause is too strict in its limitation it may be modified by a parenthesis choose men who during their time of office have never been suspected a whole class excluded by the defining clause is made eligible by the parenthesis ii similarly a parenthesis may be added to tell us that within the limits of the defining clause we have perfect freedom of choice choose men who at one time or another have held office they must have held office that is all it does not matter when iii words of comment indicating the writer s authority for his limitation his recognition of the sentiments that it may arouse and the like properly stand outside the defining clause when they are placed within it they ought to be marked as parenthetic there are men who so i am told prefer a lie to truth on its own merits the religion that obtains in europe and that unhappily has been introduced into america the latter sentence is an adaptation of one considered above on p unhappily there appeared not as a parenthesis but as an inseparable part of the relative clause which was therefore defining or non defining according as unhappily could or could not be considered as adding to the limitation but with the altered punctuation unhappily is separable from the relative clause which may now define that obtains in europe and i am sorry to have to add in america in sentences of this last type the parenthesis is inserted in the defining clause only for convenience in the others it is an essential though a negative part of the definition but all three types of parenthesis agree in this that they do not limit the antecedent they differ completely from the phrases considered above which do limit the antecedent and are not parenthetic e miscellaneous uses and abuses of the relative i a relative clause is sometimes coordinated with an independent sentence such coordination is perhaps always awkward but is not always incorrect the question arises chiefly when the two have a common subject expressed only in the relative clause for when the subject is expressed in both the independent sentence may be taken to be coordinate not with the relative clause but with the main sentence to which the relative clause is attached as in the following instance to begin with he had left no message which in itself i felt to be a suspicious circumstance and i was at my wits end how to account plausibly for his departure retain i and i was may be coordinate with he had left remove it and the coordination is necessarily between i was and i felt in our next examples the writers are committed these beatitudes are just laws which we have been neglecting and have been receiving in ourselves the consequences that were meet daily telegraph the idea which mankind most commonly conceive of proportion is the suitableness of means to certain ends and where this is not the question very seldom trouble themselves about the effect of different measures of things burke fictitious capital a name of extreme inaccuracy which too many persons are in the habit of using from the hasty assumption that what is not real must necessarily be fictitious and are more led away by a jingling antithesis of words than an accurate perception of ideas h d macleod the first two of these are wrongly coordinated the third a curiosity in other respects is in this respect right the reason is that in the first two we have a defining in the third a non defining relative clause a defining clause is grammatically equivalent to an adjective violated laws the popular idea and can be coordinated only with another word or phrase performing the same function now the phrase we have been receiving not being attached to the antecedent by means of a relative expressed or understood is not equivalent to an adjective we could have had and which we have been properly punished for neglecting or we could have had the and sentence in an adverbial form with the fitting result but coordination between the two as they stand is impossible the burke sentence is a worse offender coordination of this kind is not often attempted when the antecedent of the relative is subject of the main sentence and when it is attempted the two coordinates must of course not be separated by the predicate if we had had the idea which mankind most commonly conceive of proportion and very seldom trouble themselves about anything further the coordination would have been similar to the other and could have been rectified in the same way and beyond which they very seldom or to the exclusion of any other considerations but this alteration we can not make for there is a further and an essential difference the daily telegraph writer evidently meant his second coordinate to do the work of a defining clause he has merely failed to make the necessary connexion which we supply as above either by turning the words into a second defining clause or by embodying them adverbially in the first burke s intention is different and would not be represented by our proposed alteration in the order all that a defining clause can do in his sentence is to tell us what idea is going to be the subject if we were to give a brief paraphrase of the whole italicizing the words that represent the second coordinate it would be not mankind s sole idea of proportion is the suitableness but mankind s idea of proportion is the suitableness and very little else for the question answered is not what is mankind s sole idea but what is mankind s idea in other words the second coordinate belongs in intention not like the relative clause to the subject but to the predicate to rectify it we must either make it part of the predicate and is not concerned with or by inserting they coordinate it with the main sentence obvious as the latter correction is the sentence repays close examination as illustrating the incoherence of thought that may underlie what seems a very trifling grammatical slip but in our third example the relative clause is non defining it is grammatically equivalent to and could be replaced by an independent sentence many persons are in the habit of using it there is nothing grammatically wrong in this type of coordination it is objectionable only because it seems to promise what it does not fulfil when the common subject of two coordinates is expressed only with the first it is natural to assume that all words preceding it are also to be applied to both coordinates and the violation of this principle though not of course ungrammatical is often felt to be undesirable in other than relative clauses ii in the sentences considered above the antecedent of the relative did not belong to the second coordinate and could not have been represented in it without the material alterations there proposed but it may also happen that the antecedent as in the following examples belongs equally to both coordinates being represented in the first by a relative in the second by some other pronoun there were two or three whose accuracy was more scrupulous their judgement more uniformly sober and cautious bryce he renewed the old proposal which pizarro treated as a piece of contemptible shuffling and curtly rejected it which she has it in her option either to do or to let it alone richardson in the pair of parallel coordinates from mr bryce insert the suppressed was and it becomes clear that whose not their is the right pronoun in the pizarro sentence it is not only superfluous but disturbing to the reader who assumes that which is common to both clauses and on reaching it has to glance back and check the sentence here as often the pronoun seems to be added to restore an ill balanced sentence but that can be done in several other ways in the richardson sentence also the it should go more commonly the repetition of the antecedent in another form results from the superstitious avoidance of a preposition at the end a demand by norway for political separation to which sweden will not assent but will not go to war to prevent it times to which is not common to both coordinates accordingly the writer finds it necessary to give it in the second but even if we respect our superstition and exclude which sweden will not assent to but will not go to war to prevent we have still the two possibilities of complete relative coordination to but which subordination though she will not go to war to prevent it in our next example lord rosebery again for fear of a preposition at the end falls into the trap clumsily avoided by the times writer that promised land for which he was to prepare but scarcely to enter so perhaps bagehot though his verb may be conceive of english trade is carried on upon borrowed capital to an extent of which few foreigners have an idea and none of our ancestors could have conceived iii when the relative is the subject of both coordinates or the object of both its repetition in the second is a matter of choice but to omit the relative when it is in a different case from the first is a gross though not uncommon blunder the following are instances a league which their posterity for many ages kept so inviolably and proved so advantageous for both the kingdoms of france and scotland lockhart questions which we either do not put to ourselves or are turned aside with traditional replies mark rutherford it is just conceivable that in the last of these the subject of are is we if so the sentence is to be referred to i above wrong coordination of an independent sentence with a defining relative clause it is not easy to see why the relative more than other words should be mishandled in this way few would write but see p s f this league we kept and has proved advantageous the condensed antecedent relative what is only an apparent exception to this universal rule in the sentence what i hold is mine what is only object to hold not subject to is the subject to is is the whole noun clause what i hold sentences of this type so far from being exceptions often give a double illustration of the rule and leave a double possibility of error for just as a single what can not stand in different relations to two coordinate verbs in its clause so a single noun clause can not stand in different relations to two coordinate main verbs we can say what i have and hold where what is object to both verbs and what is mine and has been fairly earned by me where it is subject to both but we can not say what i have and has been fairly earned by me similarly we can say what i have is mine and shall remain mine where the noun clause what i have is subject to both verbs and what i have i mean to keep and will surrender to no man where it is object to both but not what i have is mine and i will surrender to no man of the various ways of avoiding this error subordination adaptation of verbs insertion of a pronoun relative or otherwise that chosen by miss bront below is perhaps the least convenient her sentence is however correct that from the spectator is not not mere empty ideas but what were once realities and that i long have thought decayed c bront whatever we possessed in the british empire possesses now and is part of the dominion of canada spectator things that were once realities and that i long have thought decayed a pair of defining clauses the condensed what must of course be distinguished from the what of indirect questions which is not relative but interrogative in the following example confusion of the two leads to an improper coordination what sums he made can only be conjectured but must have been enormous macaulay in the first sentence what is an interrogative in the second a condensed antecedent relative standing for the sums that it is the sums that were enormous it is the answer to the question what sums did he make that can only be conjectured the mistake is possible only because can and must do not reveal their number can is singular must plural the differentiation between the two what s and their equivalents is not indeed complete just as the condensed antecedent relative resembles in form though not in treatment the unresolved interrogative so the interrogative by resolution into the that which not only resembles but is grammatically identified with the uncondensed relative and antecedent the resolution is no doubt convenient it should be noticed however that the verbs with which alone it can be employed verbs that may denote either perception of a fact or other kinds of perception are precisely those with which ambiguity may result i know the house that you mean it may antecedent and relative or may not resolved interrogative follow that i have ever seen it we must first discover the scoundrel who did it antecedent and relative then we must secure the scoundrel s person resolved interrogative then only information is needed i can give a good guess at the problem that is puzzling you and the solution i know nothing of the solution i was resolving an interrogative this however does not affect sentences like the macaulay one above for although the resolved or uncondensed forms the which are grammatically identified the condensed or unresolved forms what are not iv the omission of the relative in isolated clauses as opposed to coordinates is a question not of correctness but of taste so far as there is any question at all a non defining relative can never be omitted the omission of a defining relative subject is often effective in verse but in prose is either an archaism or a provincialism it may moreover result in obscurity as in the second of our examples which may possibly puzzle the reader for a moment now it would be some fresh insect won its way to a temporary fatal new development h g wells no one finds himself planted at last in so terribly foul a morass as he would fain stand still for ever on dry ground trollope but when the defining relative is object or has a preposition there is no limit to the omission unless euphony is allowed to be one we give three instances in which the reader may or may not agree that the relative might have been retained with advantage we do that in our zeal our calmer moments would be afraid to answer scott but did you ever see anything there you had never seen before bagehot these ethical judgements we pass on self regarding acts are ordinarily little emphasized spencer v when a defining relative has the same preposition as its antecedent it is not uncommon in the written as well as in the spoken language to omit the preposition in the relative clause there is something to be said for a licence that rids us of such cumbrous formulae as in the way in which to the extent to which and the like in writing however it should be used with caution if at all in the first place if the preposition is to go the relative should go too or if retained should certainly be that not which and if the verb of the relative clause is the same as in the main sentence it should be represented by do or in a compound tense by its auxiliary component because they found that it touched them in a way which no book in the world could touch them daily telegraph the man who cleaned the slate in the manner which sir e satow has done both in morocco and japan might surely rank as a reflective diplomatist spectator in a way no other book in the world could in the way that sir e satow has done a further limitation is suggested by our next example the great powers after producing this absolutely certain result are ending with what they ought to have begun coercion spectator here of course the relative can not be omitted since relative and antecedent are one but that is not the principal fault as will appear from a resolution of the antecedent relative they are ending with the very thing that they ought to have begun we are now at liberty to omit our relative or retain it as we please in either case the omission of with is unbearable the reason is that with does not like the in of our former examples introduce a purely adverbial phrase it is an inseparable component of the compound verbs end with and begin with of which the antecedent and relative are respectively the objects similarly we can not say he has come to the precise conclusion that i thought he would come because we should be mutilating the verb to come to we can however say to the conclusion that i thought he would come to being then represented by would finally the omission is justifiable only when antecedent and relative have the same preposition sentences like the next may pass in conversation but except with the one noun

conditions so insulting that no one with a grain of self respect could accept l stephen f it that two constructions closely allied but grammatically distinct are often confused i antecedent it followed by a defining relative clause with that who which ii it followed by a clause in apposition introduced by the conjunction that the various correct possibilities are represented in the set of examples given below relative clauses are marked r conjunction clauses c one impossible example is added in brackets to mark the transition from relative to conjunction it is money that i want r it

much concern that i presently received a note informing me of his departure c in the relative construction the antecedent it is invariable whatever the number and gender of the relative the main verb is also invariable in number but in tense is usually adapted to past though not for euphony s sake to future circumstances it was you that looked foolish but it is you that will look foolish in both constructions the that clause supplemented or introduced by it gives us the subject of a predication the relative clause with it being equivalent to a pure noun the conjunction clause to a verbal noun in apposition partly retaining its verbal character in both also the predication answers an imaginary question recorded distinctly in the relative less distinctly in the conjunction clause what do you want it the thing that i want is money to whom did you give it it the persons that i gave it to was your friends as to your cutting it give particulars it that i cut it my cutting it was with a knife from the above examples it will be seen that the two constructions largely overlap when as in the relative is subject or direct object of the clause verb or is in the possessive case it can not be replaced by the conjunction but when its relation to the clause verb is marked by a preposition the conjunction always may take its place and sometimes must as in and for the relative clause can only be used when the question reflected in it is calculated to secure the right kind of answer now the natural answer to the question what did you cut it with is not difficulty but a knife the misleading with is therefore removed from the relative clause in and placed within the predicate the definite question what did you cut it with giving place to the vague demand for particulars with being removed the relative clause falls to pieces for want of a word to govern the relative and the conjunction clause takes its place in the same way it was a cab but not high indignation that he drove away in it was a concert but not curiosity that i was returning from it was a beech tree but not unpleasant circumstances that i found him under and generally it will be found that a preposition is admissible in the relative clause only when used in the literal or the most obvious sense the conjunction clause is as we have said a verbal noun so far a noun that things can be predicated of it and so far a verb that the things predicated of it are verbal relations and verbal circumstances indirect object agent instrument means manner cause attendant circumstances anything but subject and direct object my giving was to you my offering was provisionally my concealing it was because i was ashamed the mistakes that constantly occur in careless writers result from hesitation between the two forms where both are possible the confusion however ought not to arise for always with a relative clause and never with a conjunction the complement of the main predicate the answer to the suppressed question is a noun or the grammatical equivalent of a noun a knife jones you my friend in chicago the man who lives next door are the answers that accompany the relative clause with a knife with difficulty to you occasionally because i was ashamed are those that accompany the conjunction examples and though quite recognized types are really artificial perversions in the true question and answer in the circumstances would be not as the sentence falsely implies when did the plague break out that too happened in this same spring but were there any other notable events in this spring yes the plague broke out impressiveness is given to the announcement by the fiction that the reader is wondering when the plague broke out in fact he is merely waiting for whatever may turn up in the history of this spring in we go still further the implied question what were your feelings on receiving a not the note could not possibly be asked the information that alone could prompt it is only given in the that clause it has been pointed out in b that a relative clause with antecedent it particularly calls for the relative that in preference to which and even to who even when the relative is in the possessive case that which has no possessive is often retained by transferring to the main predicate the noun on which it depends thus gives place to even at the risk of ambiguity for the relative clause now supplies us with the question not whose hat but but what did you borrow leaving us theoretically in doubt whether jones s hat is distinguished from his other property from other people s hats or from things in general on the other hand the two blunders that are most frequently made almost invariably have the relative who or which and it is to me the original promoter of the whole scheme to whom they would deny my fair share in the profits to me implies a conjunction clause to whom is a relative clause it is to me that it was to mrs brent the beetle browed wife of mr commissary brent to whom the general transferred his attentions now thackeray it is to you whom i address a history which may perhaps fall into very different hands scott to you that or you to whom it is not taste that is plentiful but courage that is rare stevenson again a common blunder not however a confusion between the two constructions above but between one of them the relative and a third the sentence explains why every one seems to prefer shakespeare to ouida they are afraid to say that they like ouida best what is the explanation of this it is not the plentifulness of taste but the rarity of courage that explains it or less clumsily using the construction that stevenson doubtless intended it the inference to be drawn is not that taste is plentiful but that courage is rare participle and gerund it is advisable to make a few remarks on the participle and gerund together before taking them separately as the word gerund is variously used we first define it a gerund is the verbal noun identical in form with any participle simple or compound that contains the termination ing thus the verb write has the active participles writing having written being about to write about to write and the passive participles written having been written being written about to be written being about to be written any of these except written about to write about to be written may be a gerund also but while the participle is an adjective the gerund is a noun differing from other nouns in retaining its power if the active gerund of a transitive verb of directly governing another noun both these are of great importance for our purpose the participle itself even when confusion with the other can not occur is much abused and the slovenly uses of it that were good enough in burke s time are now recognized solecisms again the identity between the two forms leads to loose and unaccountable gerund constructions that will probably be swept away as so many other laxities have been with the advance of grammatical consciousness we shall have to deal with both these points at some length it is indeed no wonder that the forms in ing should require close attention exactly how many old english terminations ing is heir to is a question debated by historical grammarians which we are not competent to answer but we may point out that writing may now be participle i was writing i saw him writing writing piously he acts profanely gerund or full verbal noun i object to your writing that hybrid between gerund and participle i do not mind you writing it detached verbal noun writing is an acquired art concrete noun this writing is illegible moreover the verbal noun writing has the synonym to write obligatory instead of it in some connexions better in some worse in some and impossible in others compare for instance i do not like the trouble of writing i shall not take the trouble to write the trouble of writing is too much for him it is a trouble to write writing is a trouble the grammatical difficulties that is are complicated by considerations of idiom in these preliminary remarks however it is only with the distinction or want of distinction between participle and gerund that we are concerned the participle is an adjective and should be in agreement with a noun or pronoun the gerund is a noun of which it should be possible to say clearly whether and why it is in the subjective objective or possessive case as we can of other nouns that the distinction is often obscured partly in consequence of the history of the language will be clear from one or two facts and examples the man is building contains what we should all now call whether it is so or not historically a participle or verbal adjective the house is building older but still living and correct english for the house is being built contains as its remarkable difference of meaning prepares us to believe a gerund or verbal noun once governed by a now lost preposition in he stopped laughing we have a participle in he stopped laughing a verbal noun governed directly by the verb in he burst out laughing a verbal noun governed by a vanished preposition present usage does not bear out the definite modern ideas of the distinction between participle and gerund as respectively adjective and noun so long as that usage continues there are various degrees of ambiguity illustrated by the three following examples it would be impossible to say whatever the context whether the writer of the first intended a gerund or a participle in the second a previous sentence would probably have decided the question in the third though grammar again as modified by present usage leaves the question open the meaning of the sentence is practically decisive by itself can he conceive matthew arnold permitting such a book to be written and published about himself times and no doubt that end will be secured by the commission sitting in paris times those who know least of them the virtues know very well how much they are concerned in other people having them morley in the second of these if sitting is a participle the meaning is that the end will be secured by the commission which is described by way of identification as the one sitting in paris if sitting is gerund the end will be secured by the wise choice of paris and not another place for its scene if commission s were written there could be no doubt the latter was the meaning with commission there is by present usage absolutely no means of deciding between the two meanings apart from possible light in the context in the third common sense is able to tell us though grammar gives the question up that what is interesting is not the other people who have them but the question whether other people have them we shall in the section on the gerund take up the decided position that all gerunds ought to be made distinguishable from participles we are quite aware however that in the first place a language does not remodel itself to suit the grammarian s fancy for neat classification that secondly the confusion is not merely wanton or ignorant but the result of natural development that thirdly the change involves some inconveniences especially to hurried and careless writers on the other hand it is certain that the permanent tendency in language is towards the correct and logical not from it it is merely hoped that the considerable number of instances here collected may attract the attention of some writers who have not been aware of the question and perhaps convince them that the distinction is a useful one that a writer ought to know and let us know whether he is using a participle or a gerund and that to abandon the gerund when it can not be distinguished without clumsiness need cause no difficulty to any but the very unskilful in handling words participles the unattached or wrongly attached participle is one of the blunders most common with illiterate or careless writers but there are degrees of heinousness in the offence our examples are arranged from to in these degrees starting with perfect innocence participles that have passed into prepositions conjunctions or members of adverbial phrases considering the circumstances you may go seeing that it was involuntary he can hardly be blamed roughly speaking all men are liars looking at it in a shortened perspective of time those years

philosophic historians not the bill that assumes but the newspaper prophet the development into prepositions c is a natural one however the only question about any particular word of the kind is whether the vox populi has yet declared for it when it has there is no more to be said but when it has not the process should be resisted as long as possible writers acting as a suspensive house of lords an instance will be found in three quotations from burke will show that he like others of his time felt himself more at liberty than most good writers would now feel themselves founding the appeal on this basis it was judged proper to lay before parliament burke flattering themselves that their power is become necessary to the support of all order and government everything which tends to the support of that power is sanctified burke having considered terror as producing an unnatural tension and certain violent emotions of the nerves it easily follows burke similar constructions may be found on almost every page of smollett participles half justified by attachment to a pronoun implied in my your his their these are perhaps better avoided having thus run through the causes of the

close of it the following passage daily telegraph he must be the bishop for the immediately preceding sir marking the beginning of the letter shows that no one else has been mentioned but if we had given the sentence without this indication no one could possibly have believed that this was so referring is not yet unparticipled an unwary writer sometimes attaches a participle to the subject of a previous sentence assuming that it will be the subject of the new sentence also and then finds or rather is not awake enough to find himself mistaken this is a trap into which good writers sometimes fall and so dangerous to bad writers that we shall give many examples it is important for the tiro to realize that he has not satisfied the elementary requirements of grammar until he has attached the participle to a noun in the same sentence as itself not in another he must also remember that for instance i went and he came though often spoken of loosely as a sentence is in fact as fully two

is not much to be recommended having generally an alien air in english but it is sometimes useful it must be observed first that the case used should now invariably be the subjective though it was otherwise in old english secondly it is very seldom advisable to make an absolute construction and insert a pronoun for the purpose when the participle might simply be attached in ordinary agreement to a noun already to hand thirdly it is very bad to use the construction but omit to give the participle a noun or pronoun to itself these three transgressions will be illustrated in the same order by

considered whether a writer ought to let us know that he is using a gerund and not a participle when a gerund may be used without its subject s being expressed when a gerund with preposition is to be preferred to the infinitive is the gerund to be made recognizable and in the circumstances that make it possible that is when its subject is expressed is this to be done sometimes or always it is done by putting what we call for shortness sake the subject of the gerund i e the word me or my in me doing or my doing in the possessive instead of in the objective or subjective case take the typical sentence i dislike my best friend s violating my privacy it can not be a true account of the matter to say that friend is the object of i dislike and has a participle violating attached to it for a we can substitute resent which never takes a personal object for dislike without changing the sense b if we substitute a passive construction also without changing the sense we find that dislike has quite a different object privacy i dislike my privacy being violated by my friend c many of us would be willing to adopt the sentiment conveyed who yet would not admit for a moment that they disliked their best friend even when he intruded they condemn the sin but not the sinner violating then is not an ordinary participle it does not follow yet that it is a gerund it may be an extraordinary participle fused into one notion with the noun so that a friend violating means the violation by a friend the latin scholar here at once puts in the idiom of occisus caesar which does not generally mean caesar after he was killed as it naturally should but the killing of caesar or the fact that caesar had been killed the parallel is close though the use is practically confined to the passive in latin and familiar to all who know any latin at all but it shows not so much what the english construction is as how educated people have been able to reconcile themselves to an ambiguous and not very reasonable idiom not very reasonable that is after language has thrown off its early limitations and got over the first difficulty of accomplishing abstract expression of any kind the sort of fusion assumed is further illustrated for the latinist though not so closely by the latin accusative and infinitive this theory then takes violating for a participle fused into one notion with friend there are two difficulties i the construction in english is though in the nature of things not as common yet as easy in the passive as in the active now the passive of violating is either violated or being violated it is quite natural to say privacy violated once is no longer inviolable why then should it be most unnatural to say the worst of privacy violated once is that it is no longer inviolable no one not purposely seeking the unusual for some reason or other would omit being before violated in the second yet as participles violated and being violated are equally good not indeed always but in this context as the simpler privacy sentence shows the only difference between the two participles except that in brevity which tells against being violated is that the longer form can also be the gerund and the shorter can not the almost invariable choice of it is due to the instinctive feeling that what we are using is or ought to be the gerund a more convincing instance than this mere adaptation of our original example may be added many years ago i became impressed with the necessity for our infantry being taught and practised in the skilful use of their rifle lord roberts the necessity for our infantry taught and practised is absolutely impossible but why if being taught is participle and not gerund ii assuming that the fused participle theory is satisfactory and recognized whence comes the general though not universal impression among those who without being well versed in grammar are habitually careful how they speak and write that constructions like the following are ignorant vulgarisms it is no use he his doing it it is no use him his doing it that need not prevent us our believing excuse me my interrupting you a thing thing s existing does not prove that it ought to exist i was annoyed by tom tom s hesitating the tsar tsar s leaving russia is significant it failed through the king king s refusing his signature without us our hearing the man the facts can not be got at without the man man s telling us himself we can never know with a single exception for one not both of the first two none of these ought to cause a moment s uneasiness to any one who was consciously or unconsciously in the fused participle frame of mind and if they do cause uneasiness it shows that that frame of mind is not effectively present the fused participle theory having no sufficient answer to these objections but seeing that the gerund s case is also weak naturally tries a counter attack if on the other hand the gerund theory is satisfactory and recognized how is it conceivable that people should leave out the possessive s in the reckless way they do to which however the gerund makes reply i regret that they do leave it out but at least we can see how they come to it is the combined result of a mistake and an inconvenience the mistake is caused by certain types of sentence in which a real not a fused participle is so used that the noun and its unfused participle give a sense hardly distinguishable from a possessive noun and a gerund examples are this plan has now been abandoned owing to circumstances requiring the convocation of representatives of the people at the earliest possible moment times by imposing as great difficulty as possible on parents and publicans using child messengers times of course no obstacles should be

pictorial effect it invites us to imagine the physical appearance of these two great men under indignity instead of merely thinking of the abstract indignity as we should have done if czar s and arnold s had shown that we had a gerund but the difference is very fine the possessive sign might be inserted without practical effect in all these four and in hundreds like them and unlearned people may be excused for deducing that the subject of the gerund can be used at pleasure without the possessive sign while the learned comfort themselves with the fused participle theory that is the mistake the inconvenience is this it is easy enough to use the possessive adjectives my c and to add the possessive sign to most names and many single nouns but the subject of a gerund is often a long phrase after which the sign is intolerable so the mistake that the gerund may have a subject not marked by the possessive is eagerly applied to obviating the inconvenience that long gerund subjects must be avoided and that is why people drop their possessive s and why you the fused participle flourish defrauding both me the gerund and the honest participle thus answered the fused participle does not continue the argument but pleads only that there is room for all three forms before giving some examples to help in the decision we shall summarize our own opinion it is not a matter to be decided by appeal to historical grammar all three constructions may have separate legitimate descents and yet in the interests of clear thought and expression it may be better for one of them to be abandoned there are two opposite tendencies at present among careful writers to avoid the fused participle this being negative can naturally not be illustrated and to put possessive signs in slightly uncomfortable places by way of compensation among slovenly writers to throw off all limits of length for the subject of the fused participle long fused participle phrases are a variety of abstract expression and as such to be deprecated among the resources of civilization is the power of choosing between different ways of saying the same thing and literary skill is very much a matter of exercising that power a writer should recognize that if he can not get round an ugly fused participle there is still much for him to learn opportunities for ambiguity are so abundant in english owing to the number of words whose parsing depends on context that all aids to precision are valuable and it is not too much to expect a writer to know and let us know whether he means a participle or a gerund a that the possessive of all pronouns that have the form should be used instead of the objective or subjective is hardly disputed correct accordingly you may rely upon me doing all in my power

these specimens chosen not as exceptional ones but merely as not admitting of simple correction by insertion of the possessive mark the reader will perhaps agree that the long gerund subject or rather

of the gerund or infinitive be expressed and when omitted this is not a controversial matter like the last the principles are quite simple and will be accepted but it is necessary to state and illustrate them because they are often forgotten as the same mistakes are sometimes made with the infinitive that is to be considered as included roughly the subject of the gerund or infinitive should be expressed if it is different from and omitted if it is the same as the subject of the sentence to omit it when different is positively wrong and may produce actual ambiguity or worse though sometimes there is only a slipshod effect to insert it when the same is generally clumsy no one would say i succeeded to his property upon dying because i being the subject of the sentence my is naturally suggested instead of the necessary his as subject of the gerund the his must be inserted before dying even though the nature of the case obviates ambiguity to take an instance that will show both sides the following is correct i shut the door and stood with my back to it then instead of his philandering with bess i clementina mactaggart had some plain speech with john barnaby crockett subject of the sentence i subject of the gerund he they are different therefore the he must be expressed in the shape of his now rewrite the main sentence as john barnaby heard some plain speech from me clementina mactaggart the sense is the same but the his before philandering at once becomes superfluous it is not yet seriously in the way because we do not know what is the subject of philandering the name only coming later now rewrite it again as then john barnaby heard some plain speech from instead of the his is now so clumsy as to be almost impossible the insertion of superfluous subjects is much less common than the omission of necessary ones but three examples follow the first is a rare and precious variety the second has no apparent justification for the third it may be said that the unusual his has the same effect as the insertion of the parenthetic words as he actually does after limiting would have had you took food to him but instead of he reaching out his hand and taking it he kept asking for food daily telegraph harsh facts sure as she was of her never losing her filial hold of the beloved meredith i have said that mr chamberlain has no warrant for his limiting the phrase to the competitive manufacture of goods lord goschen in giving the rule summarily we used the phrase subject of the sentence that phrase is not to be confined to the subject of the main sentence but to be referred instead when necessary to the subject of the subordinate clause in which the gerund may stand for instance the good the illuminated sit apart from the rest censuring their dullness and vices as if they thought that by sitting very grand in their chairs the very brokers attorneys and congressmen would see the error of their ways and flock to them emerson here by sitting breaks the rule though the subject of sitting is the same as that of the main verb sit because the subject of the clause in which sitting comes is not the good but brokers c the right way to mend this is not to insert their before sitting which after all is clumsy though correct but to make the good the subject of the clause also by writing as if they thought that by sitting they would make the brokers see the error and sometimes subject of the sentence is to be interpreted still more freely as the word grammatically dominant in the part of the sentence that contains the gerund for instance from the bible alone was she taught the duties of morality but familiarized to her taste by hearing its stories and precepts from the lips she best loved s ferrier here the dominant word is bible to which familiarized belongs so though she does happen to be the main subject her must be inserted because the familiarized phrase removes the gerund from the reach of the main subject after these explanations we add miscellaneous instances it will be seen that transgression of the rule though it seldom makes a sentence ambiguous enough to deceive easily makes it ambiguous enough to amuse the reader at wrong moments or gives an impression of amateurish work mistakes are mended sometimes by inserting the subject of the gerund or infinitive sometimes by changing the main subject to make it the same as that of the gerund sometimes by other recasting an excellent arrangement for a breeching which when released remains with the carriage so that lead or centre horses can be put in the wheel

the subject we plead guilty if we were caught in the act but otherwise not guilty choice between the gerund with preposition and the infinitive it was said in the preliminary section on the participle and gerund that writing the verbal noun or gerund and to write the infinitive are in some sense synonyms but phrases were given showing that it is by no means always indifferent which of the two is used it is a matter of idiom rather than of grammar but this seems the most convenient place for drawing attention to it to give satisfactory rules would require many more examples and much more space than can be afforded but something will be gained if students are convinced that many of the mistakes made give sentences the appearance of having been written by a foreigner or one who is not at home with the literary language that the mistakes are nearly always on one side the infinitive being the form that should only be used with caution that a slight change in arrangement may require a change from infinitive to gerund or vice versa a when the infinitive or gerund is attached to a noun defining or answering the question what hope c about it it is almost always better to use the gerund with

is unfortunate that the idiomatic use while it comes by nature to southern englishmen who will find most of this section superfluous is so complicated that those who are not to the manner born can hardly acquire it and for them the section is in danger of being useless in apology for the length of these remarks it must be said that the short and simple directions often given are worse than useless the observant reader soon loses faith in them from their constant failure to take him right and the unobservant is the victim of false security roughly speaking should follows the same rules as shall and would as will in what follows sh may be taken as an abbreviation for shall should and should have and w for will would and would have in our usage of the sh and w forms as seen in principal sentences there are elements belonging to three systems the first of these in which each form retains its full original meaning and the two are not used to give different persons of the same tense we shall call the pure system the other two both hybrids will be called one the coloured future the other the plain future system in old english there was no separate future present and future were one shall and will were the presents of two verbs to which belong also the pasts should and would the conditionals should and would and the past conditionals should have and would have shall had the meaning of command or obligation and will of wish but as commands and wishes are concerned mainly with the future it was natural that a future tense auxiliary should be developed out of these two verbs the coloured future results from the application to future time of those forms that were practically useful in the pure system they consequently retain in the coloured future with some modifications the ideas of command and wish proper to the original verbs the plain future results from the taking of those forms that were practically out of work in the pure system to make what had not before existed a simple future tense these have accordingly not retained the ideas of command and wish which were the practically useful and which the superfluous forms in the pure system must now be explained thou shall not steal is the type of shall in the pure system we do not ordinarily issue commands to ourselves consequently i shall is hardly required but we often ask for orders and therefore shall i is required the form of the shall present in the pure system is accordingly shall i you shall he shall shall we they shall as to the past tense orders can not be given but may be asked about so that for instance what should i do i e what was i to do can be done all through interrogatively in the conditionals both statement and question can be done all through i can give orders to my imaginary though not to my actual self i can not say as a command i shall do it but i can say as a conditional command i should do it i shall and we shall are accordingly the superfluous forms of the present shall in the pure system again with will i will meaning it is my will it is obvious that we can generally state this only of ourselves we do not know the inside of other people s minds but we can ask about it the present runs then i will will you will he we will will they the past tense can here be done all through both positively and interrogatively for though we can not tell other people s present will we can often infer their past will from their actions so i was asked but i would not and why would i do it all through and similarly in the conditionals i would not if i could c the spare forms supplied by the present will then are you will he will they will and these with i shall we shall are ready when the simple future is required to construct it out of we can now give rule the pure system when sh and w retain the full original meanings of command and wish each of them is used in all three persons so far as it is required the following examples show most of what we inherit directly from the pure system thou shalt not steal not required in first person shall i open the door not required in second you should not say such things in all persons and shall trelawny die hardly required in second whom should he meet but jones was it his fate in all why should you suspect me in all it should seem so it would apparently be incumbent on us to believe isolated idiom with third i will have my way not required in second and third but see below i he asked him me to do it but he i would not in all i would not have done it for the world in all i would be told to wait a while habitual in all will you come with me not required in first i would i were dead not required in second and third he will bite his nails whatever i say in all he will often stand on his head in all you will still be talking i e you always are not required in first a coat will last two years with care it will be noticed that the last four forms are among those that were omitted as not required by the pure system will would rarely be required in second and third person statements but would of course be possible in favourable circumstances as in describing habitual action where the will of another may be inferred from past experience the last of all is a natural extension of the idiom even to things that have no will all these habitual uses are quite different from i will have my way and though you will have your way is possible it always has the habitual meaning which i will have my way is usually without all the forms in the above list and others like them have three peculiarities that they are not practically futures as distinguished from presents that they use sh for all persons or w for all persons if the idea is appropriate to all persons and that the ideas are simply or with very little extension those of command or obligation and wish the coloured future system is so called because while the future sense is more distinct it is still coloured with the speaker s mood command and wish receive extensions and include promise permission menace consent assurance intention refusal offer c and the forms used are invariably those from both sh and w that we called the practically useful ones in the pure system that is we have always i will shall i you shall will you he shall will he we will shall we they shall will they and the conditionals should and would should have and would have are used with exactly the same variations it will be borne in mind however that no clear line of division can be drawn between the pure system and the coloured future system since the latter is developed naturally whereas the plain future system is rather developed artificially out of the former and especially the questions of the coloured future are simply those of the pure system without any sort of modification rule the coloured future system in future and conditional statements that include without the use of special words for the purpose an expression of the speaker s not necessarily of the subject s wish intention menace assurance consent refusal promise offer permission command c in such sentences the first person has w the second and third persons sh i will tell you presently my promise you shall repent it before long my menace he shall not have any my refusal we would go if we could our conditional intention you should do it if we could make you our conditional command they should have had it if they had asked my conditional consent the only questions possible here are the asking for orders and the requests already disposed of under rule observe that i would like which is not english is not justified by this rule because the speaker s mood is expressed by like and does not need double expression it ought to be i should like under rule observe also that i sha n t you will go to your room and stay there are only apparent exceptions which will be explained under rule the archaic literary forms you shall find a rogue shall often pass for an honest man though now affected and pretentious are grammatically defensible the speaker asks us to take the fact on his personal assurance the forms little required in the pure system and therefore ready to hand for making the new plain future were i and we shall you he and they will these accordingly constitute the plain future and the corresponding forms of the plain conditional are used analogously questions follow the same rule with one very important exception which will be given a separate rule we now give rule the plain future system in plain statements about the future and in the principal clause result or apodosis of plain conditional sentences whether the subordinate clause condition or if clause is expressed or not the first person has sh the second and third persons w questions conform except those of the second person for which see rule i shall you will die some day shall i will they be here to morrow we should he would have consented if you had asked should we would he have missed you if you had been there i should you would like a bathe should i would he like it myself himself some apparent exceptions already anticipated must here be explained it may be said that i shall execute your orders being the speaker s promise you will go to your room being the speaker s command and sha n t the nursery abbreviation for i shall not do it being the speaker s refusal these are all coloured futures so that sh and w should be reversed in each they are such in effect but they are not in form in each the other form would be possible and correct the first is a promise only so far as the hearer chooses to take as a promise the plain future or impersonal prophecy but the speaker emphasizes his obedience by implying that of course since the order has been given it will be executed the matter is settled without his unimportant consent the other two gain force by the opposite assumption that the speaker s will and the future are absolutely identical so that what he intends may be confidently stated as a future fact in the first example the desired submissiveness in the other two the desired imperiousness supercilious or passionate are attained by the same impersonality before giving the rule for second person questions we observe that questions generally follow the rule of the class of statement they correspond to this was shown in the pure system rule there are no questions apart from those already accounted for by the pure system belonging to the coloured future rule in the plain future rule first and third person questions are like the plain future statements but second person questions under the plain future invariably use sh or w according as the answer for which the speaker is prepared has sh or w care is necessary however in deciding what that answer is in should would you like a bathe should is almost always right because the answer expected is almost always either yes i should or no i should not the question being asked for real information it is true that would you like is very commonly used like the equally wrong i would like but it is only correct when the answer is intended to be given by the asker no of course you would not a clearer illustration of this is the following sentence which requires sh or w according to circumstances will shall you now so fresh and fair be in a hundred years nothing but mouldering dust this might possibly be asked in expectation of an answer from the person apostrophized yes i shall much more probably it would be asked in expectation of the answer from the speaker himself to his own question alas yes you will and shall ought to be used for the question only in the first case will in the second case similarly ah yes that is all very well but will shall you be able to do it use will if the answer is meant to be no of course you will not shall if the answer expected is yes i shall or no i shall not in practice sh is more commonly required because questions asked for information are commoner than rhetorical ones but observe the common would you believe it answer no of course you would not should you believe it also possible would indicate real curiosity about the other person s state of mind which is hardly ever felt would you believe it however might also be accounted for on the ground that the answer would be no i would not which would be a coloured future form meaning i should never consent to believe rule second person questions second person questions invariably have sh or w by assimilation to the answer expected it may be added since it makes the application of the rule easier that the second person questions belonging not to the plain future but to the pure system are also though not because of assimilation the same in regard to sh and w as their answers thus will you come yes i will each on its merits as well as shall you be there yes i shall assimilation should you not have known yes i should each on its merits should means ought as well as what should you think i should think you were right assimilation the true form for all second person questions then can be ascertained by deciding what the expected answer is this completes what need be said about principal sentences with the exception of one important usage that might cause perplexity if some one says to me you would think so yourself if you were in my position i may either answer no i should not regularly or may catch up his word and retain the w though the alteration of person requires sh thus would i though no i wouldn t accordingly rule echoes a speaker repeating and adapting another s words may neglect to make the alteration from sh to w or from w to sh that an alteration of the person strictly requires we have now all the necessary rules for principal sentences and can put down a few examples of the right usage noteworthy for various reasons and some blunders the latter being illustrated in proportion to their commonness the number of the rule observed or broken will be added in brackets for reference the passage from johnson with which the correct examples begin is instructive right i would injure no man and should provoke no resentment i would relieve every distress and should enjoy the benedictions of gratitude i would choose my friends among the wise and my wife among the virtuous and therefore should be in no danger from treachery or unkindness my children should by my care be learned and pious and would repay to my age what their childhood had received johnson chatham it should seem ought to have taken the same side macaulay for instance when we allege that it is against reason to tax a people under so many restraints in trade as the americans the noble lord in the blue riband shall tell you burke the critic

should you waste yourself upon those ugly giggling girls r g white it wouldn t be quite proper to take her alone would it what should you say r g white whether i have attained this the future shall decide i consent to accept the verdict of the future times wrong we give first many examples of the mistake that is out of all proportion the commonest using the coloured future when the speaker s mood is sufficiently given by a separate word in the second example for instance i would ask the favour would be quite right and would mean i should like to ask as it stands it means i should like to like to ask the same applies to the other instances which are only multiplied to show how dangerous this particular form is among these i would be inclined to place those who acquiesce in the phenomenalism of mr herbert spencer daily telegraph as one of the founders of the navy league i would like to ask the favour of your well known courtesy times i would be glad to have some account of

thousands of paragraphs in the newspaper we would wish for brighter news westminster gazette i have already had some offers of assistance and i would be glad to receive any amount towards the object times some examples follow that have not this excuse and the first two deserve comment the first because it results in serious ambiguity the second because it is possibly not wrong the two fleets present seven russian battleships against four japanese less than two to one two russian armoured cruisers against eight and seven russian torpedo boat destroyers against an indefinite number of the enemy here we will not exaggerate in attributing to the japanese three or four to one mahan with will the meaning must be we won t call them three or four to one because that would be exaggeration but the meaning is intended to be we will call them that and it will be no exaggeration shall is absolutely necessary however to make it bear that interpretation this character who delights us may commit murder like macbeth or fly the battle for his sweetheart as did antony or betray his country like coriolanus and yet we will rejoice in every happiness that comes to him w b yeats it is possible that this is the use of will described as the habitual use he will often stand on his head under rule but this is very rare though admissible in the first person of the present we shall rejoice or simply we rejoice would be the plain way of saying it if this passion was simply painful we would shun with the greatest care all persons and places that could excite such a passion burke what would we be without our appetites s ferrier if i was ever to be detected i would have nothing for it but to drown myself s ferrier i will never forget in the year one notorious revivalist daily telegraph as long as i am free from all resentment hardness and scorn i would be able to face the life with much more calm and confidence than i would wilde in the next two if i think and the if clause were removed the shall and will would stand expressing resolve according to rule but with those additions it is clear that prophecy or pure future is meant and shall and will should be will and shall nothing i think shall ever make me forgive him richardson we were victorious in and we will be victorious now at any cost if we are strong in an alliance between the governing class and the governed times we now proceed to subordinate clauses and first to the substantival the word reported will mean made indirect or subordinated substantivally not always actually reported reported statement is quite simple when it is of the pure system or the coloured future the sh or w of the original statement is retained in the reported form unaffected by any change of person that the reporting involves thus pure system he forgave me you or her though he said i you or she should not have left him in the lurch like that coloured future you said i or he should repent it either of these is a report of either you shall repent it or he shall repent it coloured future you said you or i said i would apologize both are reports of i will apologize but with the plain future system there is difficulty and some inconsistency the change of person sometimes required by reported speech has almost always the effect here of introducing sh if i or we appears in the words as reported and usually the effect of introducing w if you he or they appears the following are all the types in which doubt can arise except that each of these may occur in either number and in past or present the form that would be required by analogy keeping the original sh or w is given first and the one generally used instead is added in brackets reporting i shall never succeed we get you said you should would never succeed he says he shall will never succeed reporting you will or he will never succeed we get you say i will shall never succeed he said i would should never succeed even those persons who have generally a just confidence in their own correctness about sh and w will allow that they have some doubt about the first pair and nearly every one will find w in the second pair however reasonable and consistent intolerable if the reader will now go through the four sentences again and substitute for succeed the phrase do it which may or may not mean succeed he will see that the orthodox should and shall of the first pair become actually more natural than the commoner would and will and that even in the second pair will and would are now tolerable the reason is that with do it there is risk of confusion with the reported forms of i will never do it and you shall never do it which are not plain futures but coloured futures meaning something quite different reported questions present the same difficulties again those only are doubtful that belong to the plain future there for instance reporting shall you do it we can say by the correct analogy i asked him whether he should and we generally do so if the verb as here lends itself to ambiguity i asked him whether he would do it is liable to be mistaken for the report of will you do it a request if on the other hand as in reporting shall you be there there is little risk of misunderstanding i asked him whether he would is commoner and again it is only in extreme cases if even then that the original w can be kept when the report introduces i in place of the original question s you or he for instance the original question being how will he be treated it may be just possible to say you had made up your mind how i would be treated because you had made up your mind how i should be treated almost inevitably suggests assisted by the ambiguity of making up your mind which may imply either resolve or inference that the original question was how shall he be treated it would be well perhaps if writers who take their responsibilities seriously would stretch a point sometimes to keep the more consistent and less ambiguous usage alive but for practical purposes the rule must run rule substantival clauses in these whether reported strictly or otherwise subordinated pure system or coloured future forms invariably keep the sh or w of the original statement or question unaffected by any change of person reports of plain future forms do this also if there would be serious danger of ambiguity but almost always have sh in the first person and usually w in the second and third persons as the division of substantival clauses into indirect or reported or subordinate or oblique statements questions and commands is familiar it may be well to explain that in english the reported command strictly so called hardly exists in what has the force of a reported command it is in fact a statement that is reported for instance he said i was to go though used as the indirect form of go is really the indirect of the statement you are to go he ordered that they should be released though the actual words were be they or let them be released is formed on the coloured future statement they shall be released it is therefore unnecessary to give special rules for reported command but there are one or two types of apparent indirect command about which though there is no danger of error the reader may feel curious a i stipulate that i shall you shall he shall do it why shall in all persons because the original form is i you he shall do it i stipulate that where shall means am to are to is to that is it is a pure system form b i beg that you or he will do it he begs that i will do it again the original is pure system you or he will i e you consent to do it that is what i beg i will i e i consent to do it that is what he begs c i beg that i or he shall not suffer for it you begged that i should not suffer for it observe that b has will and a and c shall because it is only in b that the volition of the subject of shall or will is concerned d i wish you would not sneeze before subordination this is you will not sneeze that is what i wish w remains but will becomes would to give the remoteness always connected with wish which is seen also for instance in i wish i were instead of i wish i be before going on to examples of substantival clauses we also register again rather for the curious than for the practical reader the peculiar but common use of should contained in the following it is not strange that his admiration for those writers should have been unbounded macaulay in this use should goes through all persons and is equivalent to a gerund with possessive that a man should be is the same as a man s being we can only guess at its origin our guess is that should is the remote form for shall as would for will in d above substituted in order to give an effect of generality and the use of shall is the archaic one seen in you shall find c so a man shall be afraid of his shadow that a man should be afraid as a generally observed fact is strange after each of the substantival clauses of which examples now follow we shall say whether it is a reported subordinated statement or question and give what we take to be the original form of the essential words even when further comment is unnecessary examples of sh and w in substantival clauses right you my dear believe you shall be unhappy if you have mr solmes your parents think the contrary and that you will be undoubtedly so were you to have mr lovelace richardson statement the original of the first is i shall be of the second she will be in this and the next three the strictly analogical form that we recommended is kept i have heard the princess declare that she should not willingly die in a crowd johnson statement i should not people imagine they should be happy in circumstances which they would find insupportably burthensome in less than a week cowper statement we should they would is not reported do you really fancy you should be more beholden to your correspondent if he had been damning you all the time for your importunity stevenson statement i should be the nation had settled the question that it would not have conscription times statement we will not the blundering insertion of the question perhaps due to some hazy notion of putting the question may be disregarded when the war will end still depends on japan times question when will it end shaftesbury s anger vented itself in threats that the advisers of this dissolution should pay for it with their heads j r green statement you shall pay he i e james ii regarded his ecclesiastical supremacy as a weapon under henry and elizabeth it had been used to turn the church of england from catholic to protestant under james it should be used to turn it back again j r green statement under me it shall be the reporting word not expressed she could not bear the sight of all these things that reminded her of anthony and of her sin perhaps she should die soon she felt very feeble eliot statement i shall again the reporting word absent there will never perhaps be a time when every question between london and washington shall be laid at rest times this is not properly speaking reported speech but the shall is accounted for by a sort of allusion to a supposed prophecy every question shall one day be laid at rest in that prophecy shall would convey that the prophet gave his personal guarantee for it and would come under rule this is not to be confused with the use of shall in indefinite clauses that will be noticed later wrong the four began their descent not knowing at what step they should meet death nor which of them should reach the shore alive f m crawford questions at what step shall we meet which of us will reach the first is accordingly right the second wrong the modern writer who has been at the pains to use the strictly correct should in the first place rather than the now common would has not seen as richardson did in the first of the right examples that his two clauses are dissimilar i hope that our sympathy shall survive these little revolutions undiminished stevenson statement will survive it is possible however that the original was thought of or rather felt as our sympathy shall survive but as the effect of that is to give the speaker s personal guarantee for the truth of the thing it is clearly not a proper statement to make dependent on the doubtful word hope after mentioning the advance made in reforms of the military force of the country he lord lansdowne announced that the government should not oppose the motion readily availing themselves of lord wemyss s suggestion that times statement we shall not or the government will not probably lord lansdowne said we and that accounts for should but if the times chooses to represent we by the government it must also represent shall by would it came with a strange stunning effect upon us all the consciousness that never again would we hear the grind of those positive boot heels on the gravel crockett statement we shall never i think that if the matter were handed over to the parish councils we would within a twelvemonth have exactly such a network of rifle clubs as is needed conan doyle statement we should of these two instances it may be thought that the writers would have made the mistake in the original unsubordinated sentence instead of its arising in the process of subordination our experience is however that many people do in fact go wrong in subordinate clauses who are alive to the danger in simple sentences the prime minister would at once have asked the opposition if they could suggest any further means for making the inquiry more drastic and complete with the assurance that if they could suggest any such means they would at once be incorporated in the government scheme spectator statement they shall be incorporated we have classed this as wrong on the assumption supported by the word assurance that the prime minister gave a promise and therefore used the coloured future and did not state a fact and use the plain future another type of subordinate clause important for sh and w is the conditional protasis or if clause it is not necessary nor with modern writers usual to mark the future or conditional force of this separately since it is sufficiently indicated by the apodosis for instance if you come i shall be glad if you came i should be glad if you had come i should have been glad but in formal style or with a slight difference of meaning it is often superfluously done in the protasis too sh is then used for all persons as if he should come you would learn how the matter stands so japan will adhere to her pledge of neutrality unless russia shall first violate hers times but to the rule that the protasis takes shall there are three exceptions real or apparent w is found under the following circumstances an original pure system or coloured future w is not changed to sh by being used in subordination to if or unless it is retained with its full original force instead of some verb like wish or choose in if we would believe we might move mountains the meaning is if we chose to believe different from that of if we believed or should believe so it would be much better if you would not be so hypocritical captain wybrow eliot if you consented not to be or did not insist on being it would be valuable if he would somewhat expand his ideas regarding local defence by volunteers times if he consented to when the if clause though a genuine condition is incorrectly expressed for the sake of brevity and compresses two verbs into one the w proper to the retained verb is sometimes necessarily used instead of the sh proper to the verb that though it contains in strict logic the essential protasis has been crushed out thus if it will be useless i shall prefer not to do it it is not the uselessness that is the condition of the preference for the use or uselessness is subsequent to the decision it is my conviction of the uselessness so that the full form would be if i shall be or am in ordinary speech convinced that it will be useless i shall prefer c the following example can be defended on this ground if never again will he standing for if he shall realize that he will never the feebleness that decides his not wishing is subsequent to it and can only condition it if taken in the sense of his anticipation of feebleness and if there is to be no recovery if never again will he be young and strong and passionate if the actual present shall be to him always like a thing read in a book or remembered out of the far away past he will not greatly wish for the continuance of a twilight that stevenson the next is more difficult only because besides the compression the if clause is protasis not to the expressed main sentence but to another that is suppressed i shall wait for fine weather if that will ever come r g white given fully this would run i shall wait for fine weather at least i should say so if i were sure that that will ever come when an if clause is not a condition at all as for instance where it expresses contrast and is almost equivalent to although the ordinary plain future use prevails thus if annihilation will end our joys it will also end our griefs contrast with this the real condition in if annihilation shall end or ends our joys we shall never regret the loss of them indefinite clauses relative or other bearing the same relation to a conditional or future principal sentence that a conditional protasis bears to its apodosis follow the same rules thus whoever compares the two will find is equivalent to if any one compares when we have won the battle we can decide that question is equivalent to if ever we have won accordingly we can if we choose write whoever shall compare and when we shall have won but we can not write when we will have won and must only write whoever will compare if we distinctly mean whoever chooses to compare as there is sometimes difficulty in analysing indefinite clauses of this sort one or two instances had better be considered the candidate who should have distinguished himself most was to be chosen this is clear enough it is equivalent to if any one should have he was we must ask ourselves what victory will cost the russian people when at length it will become possible to conclude the peace so ardently desired times equivalent to if ever it at length becomes will is therefore wrong either becomes or shall become nothing can now prevent it from continuing to distil upwards until there shall be no member of the legislature who shall not know huxley this is a complicated example the shalls will be right if it appears that each shall clause is equivalent to a conditional protasis we may show it by starting at the end as with the house that jack built and constructing the sentence backwards subordinating by stages and changing will to shall as the protases come in it will be allowed that until means to the time when and that when may be resolved into if ever thus we get a one will know b none will be a member of the legislature unless one shall know c it will distil to the time if ever none shall be a member unless one shall know think what i will about them i must take them for politeness sake r g white although think what i will is an indefinite relative clause meaning practically whatever i think will here is right the strict sense being whatever i choose to think indeed the time of think is probably not at any rate need not be future at all compare think what i will i do not tell my thoughts we now give rule conditional protasis and indefinite clauses in the protasis or if clause of conditional sentences sh may be used with all persons generally neither sh nor w is used w is only used when the full meaning of wish is intended it may then be used with all persons when the protasis is elliptically expressed w may then be necessary with the second and third persons when the if clause is not a real conditional protasis there is then no reason for sh with second and third persons indefinite classes of similar character follow the same rules a few right but exceptional and some wrong subordinate clauses may now be added examples of sh and w in subordinate clauses right as an opiate or spirituous liquors shall suspend the operation of grief burke we may conceive mr worldly wiseman accosting such an one and the conversation that should thereupon ensue stevenson she is such a spare straight dry old lady such a pew of a woman that you should find as many individual sympathies in a chip dickens in these three we have the archaic shall of personal assurance that comes under rule and its corresponding conditional appearing in subordinate clauses there is no objection to it except that in modern writers its context must be such as to exonerate it from the charge of affectation the longing of the army for a fresh struggle which should restore its glory j r green this use of sh after final relatives is seen if the compound sentence is resolved to point to an original coloured future we long for a fresh struggle a fresh struggle shall restore that is we intend it to restore our glory he was tormented by that restless jealousy which should seem to belong only to minds burning with the desire of fame macaulay this is the should seem explained under rule appearing also as subordinate wrong it should never be but often is forgotten that when the apodosis of a conditional sentence with or without expressed protasis is subordinate it is nevertheless still an apodosis and has still sh in the first w in the second and third persons in he struck him a blow we do not feel the first object to be datival as we would in he gave him a blow h sweet i can not let the moment pass at which i would have been enjoying a visit to you after your severe illness without one word of sympathy gladstone it would mean that i would always be haunted by an intolerable sense of disgrace wilde but though i would not willingly part with such scraps of science i do not set the same store by them stevenson we must reconcile what we would like to do with what we can do times all these are wrong in the last two the mistake is perhaps accounted for by the presence of willingly and like i would not willingly can indeed be defended at the cost of admitting that willingly is mere tautology and saying that i would not means i should not consent to according to rule it may be worth while to add that the subordinate apodosis still follows the rule even if it is subordinated to if so that it is part of the protasis of another conditional sentence the following which is of course quite correct seems but only seems to break the rules both for protasis and apodosis if you would be patient for yourself you should be patient for me but we have w with second person in the protasis because would be patient is also apodosis to the implied protasis if occasion should arise and the should with second person in the apodosis is not a conditional should at all but a pure system should which would be the same with any person it means simply you ought or it would be your duty the result in part of a genuine anxiety lest the chinese would gradually grow until they monopolized the country times we have purposely refrained until now from invoking the subjunctive because the word is almost meaningless to englishmen the thing having so nearly perished but on this instance it must be remarked that when conjunctions like lest which could once or still can take a subjunctive as lest he die use a compound form instead they use the sh forms for all persons it is a matter of little importance since hardly any one would go wrong in such a sentence the perfect infinitive this has its right and its wrong uses the right are obvious and can be left alone even of the wrong some are serviceable if not strictly logical i hoped to have succeeded for instance means i hoped to succeed but i did not succeed and has the advantage of it in brevity it is an idiom that it would be a pity to sacrifice on the altar of reason so philosophy began to congratulate herself upon such a proselyte from the world of business and hoped to have extended her power under the auspices of such a leader burke and here he can not forbear observing that it was the duty of that publisher to have rebutted a statement which he knew to be a calumny borrow i was going to have asked when sladen but other perfects while they are still more illogical than these differ as little in meaning from the present as the deposuisse dear to the hearts of elegiac writers ancient and modern differs from deponere and whereas there is at least metre and very useful metre in deposuisse there is in our corresponding perfect infinitive neither rhyme nor reason thus with whom on those golden summer evenings i should have liked to have taken a stroll in the hayfield thackeray to have taken means simply to take the implication of non fulfilment that justified the perfects above is here needless being already given in i should have liked and the doubled have is ugly in sound similar are if my point

conditionals these which cost the schoolboy at his latin and greek some weary hours need not detain us long the reader passes lightly and unconsciously in his own language over mixtures that might have caused him searchings of heart in a dead one but there is one corrupt and meaningless form apparently gaining ground that calls for protest when a clause begins with as if it must be remembered that there is an ellipse i treat her as tenderly as if she were my daughter would be in full i treat her as tenderly as i should if she were c if this is forgotten there is danger in some sentences

of as if it might not as of course it may the same rule applies to as though the use of true subjunctive forms if he be though it happen in conditional sentences is for various reasons not recommended these forms with the single exception of were are perishing so rapidly that an experienced word actuary puts their expectation of life at one generation as a matter of style they should be avoided being certain to give a pretentious air when handled by any one except the skilful and practised writers who need no advice from us and as a matter of grammar the instinct for using subjunctives rightly is dying with the subjunctive so that even the still surviving were is often used where it is completely wrong so it would be advisable to wait for fuller details before making any attempt to appraise the significance of the raid from the military point of view if indeed the whole expedition were not planned with an eye to effect times here the last clause means though perhaps it was only planned with an eye to effect and therefore has no military significance but if followed by were not necessarily means that it certainly is the mistake here results in making the clause look as if it were the protasis to it would be advisable with which it has in fact nothing whatever to do it is a note on the words military significance write was for were and who taking my offered hand bade me good morning nightfall though it were times the sentence describes a meeting with a person who knew hardly any english he said good morning though it was nightfall a single example may be added of the intrusion of were for was in a sentence that is not conditional dr chalmers was a believer in an establishment as he conceived an establishment should be whether such an establishment were possible or not it is not for me now to discuss lord rosebery were however is often right and almost necessary other subjunctives are never necessary often dangerous and in most writers unpleasantly formal the tiro had much better eschew them doubt that and doubt whether instances will be found in part ii of verbs constructed with wrong prepositions or conjunctions most mistakes of this kind are self evident but the verb doubt which is constructed with that or whether according to the circumstances under which the doubt is expressed requires special notice the broad distinction is between the positive i doubt whether that and the negative i do not doubt that whether and the rule in order to include implied as well as expressed negatives questions as well as statements will run thus the word used depends upon the writer s or speaker s opinion as to the reasonableness of the doubt no matter in whose mind it is said to exist or not to exist if there is nothing to show that the writer considers the doubt an unreasonable one the word is always whether which reminds us that there is a suppressed alternative i doubt whether this is true or not every one is at liberty to doubt whether or not to this part of the rule there is no exception if it is evident that the writer disapproves of the doubt the words introducing it amount to an affirmation on his part that the thing doubted is undoubtedly true the alternative is no longer offered that is therefore the word i do not doubt that i e i am sure that who can doubt that this however is modified by the vivid use of whether when the writer s point is rather the extravagance of the doubt than the truth of the thing doubted whether is often retained it is as if a man should doubt whether he has a head on his shoulders can we imagine any man seriously doubting whether here according to we ought to have that since the writer evidently regards the doubt as absurd but in the first sentence it is necessary for the force of the illustration that the deplorable condition of the doubter s mind should be vividly portrayed accordingly he is represented to us as actually handling the two alternatives similarly in the second we are invited to picture to ourselves if we can a hesitation so ludicrous in the writer s opinion we shall illustrate this point further by a couple of sentences in which again the state of mind of the doubter not the truth of the thing doubted is clearly the point but in which that has been improperly substituted for the vivid whether she found herself wondering at the breath she drew doubting that another would follow meredith i am afraid that you will become so afraid of men s motives as to doubt that any one can be honest trollope the mistake commonly made is to use that for whether in violation of whether is seldom used in place of that and apparent violations of often prove to be legitimate exceptions of the vivid kind some of our examples may suggest that when the dependent clause is placed before the verb that appears because the writer had not decided what verb of doubt or denial to use this is probably the true explanation of many incorrect thats but is not a sufficient defence it supplies on the contrary an additional reason for adhering to whether the reader is either actually misled or at any rate kept in needless suspense as to what is going to be said because the writer did not make up his mind at the right time how to say it whether at the beginning at once proclaims an open question after that we expect or ought to expect i have no reason to doubt in all the following whether should have been used there is nothing for it but to doubt such diseases exist h g wells whether is never suppressed i do not think it would have pleased mr

are inclined to doubt times it was generally doubted that france would permit the use of her port times prepositions in an uninflected language like ours these are ubiquitous and it is quite impossible to write tolerably without a full knowledge conscious or unconscious of their uses misuse of them however does not often result in what may be called in the fullest sense blunders of syntax but mostly in offences against idiom it is often impossible to convince a writer that the preposition he has used is a wrong one because there is no reason in the nature of things in logic or in the principles of universal grammar whichever way it may be put why that preposition should not give the desired meaning as clearly as the one that we tell him he should have used idioms are special forms of speech that for some reason often inscrutable have proved congenial to the instinct of a particular language to neglect them shows a writer however good a logician he may be to be no linguist condemns him from that point of view more clearly than grammatical blunders themselves but though the subject of prepositions is thus very important the idioms in which they appear are so multitudinous that it is hopeless to attempt giving more than the scantiest selection this may at least put writers on their guard usages of this sort can not be acquired from dictionaries and grammars still less from a treatise like the present not pretending to be exhaustive good reading with the idiomatic eye open is essential we give a few examples of what to avoid after adjectives and adverbs another stroke of palsy soon rendered sir sampson unconscious even to the charms of grizzy s conversation s ferrier being oblivious to the ill feeling it would be certain to engender

prefers from is not yet to be named pedantry it is at any rate defensive and not offensive pedantry different to though found in writers of all ages oxford dictionary being on the whole the aggressor with averse on the other hand though the oxford dictionary gives a long roll of good names on each side the use of from may perhaps be said to strike most readers as a distinct protest against the more natural to so that from is here the aggressor and the pedantry if it is pedantry is offensive our advice is to write different from and averse to we shall give a few examples and add to them two sentences in which the incorrect use of from with other words looks like the result of insisting on the slightly artificial use of it after different and averse my experience caused me to make quite

guess is good chaucerian but in neither case can the appeal to a dead usage dead in polite society or in england justify what is a modern vulgarism compound prepositions and conjunctions the increasing use of these is much to be regretted they and the love for abstract expression with which they are closely allied are responsible for much of what is flaccid diffuse and nerveless in modern writing they are generally no doubt invented by persons who want to express a more precise shade of meaning than they can find in anything already existing but they are soon caught up by others who not only do not need the new delicate instrument but do not understand it inasmuch as for instance originally expressed that the truth of its clause gave the exact measure of the truth that belonged to the main sentence so from the oxford dictionary god is only god inasmuch as he is the moral governor of the world sir w hamilton but long before hamilton s day the word passed very naturally into the meaning for which it need never have been invented of since or because consequently most people who need the original idea have not the courage to use inasmuch as for it like sir w hamilton but resort to new combinations with far those new combinations however as will be shown fluctuate and are confused with one another the best thing we can now do with inasmuch as is to get it decently buried when it means since since is better when it means what it once meant no one understands it the moral we wish to draw is that these compounds should be left altogether alone except in passages where great precision is wanted just as a word like save except is ruined for the poet by being used on every page of ordinary prose which it disfigures in revenge for its own degradation so inasmuch as is spoilt for the logician we shall first illustrate the absurd prevailing abuse of the compound preposition as to in each of the following sentences if as to is simply left out no difference whatever is made in the meaning it is only familiarity with unnecessary circumlocution that makes such a state of things tolerable to any one with a glimmering of literary discernment as to flows from

for another for the sake of variety and some miscellaneous examples will be found at the end of the section but we are chiefly concerned with what may be called pronominal variation in which the word avoided is either a noun or its obvious pronoun substitute the use of pronouns is itself a form of variation designed to avoid ungainly repetition and we are only going one step further when instead of either the original noun or the pronoun we use some new equivalent mr gladstone for instance having already become he presently appears as that statesman variation of this kind is often necessary in practice so often that it should never be admitted except when it is necessary many writers of the present day abound in types of variation that are not justified by expediency and have consequently the air of cheap ornament it is impossible to lay down hard and fast rules but two general principles may be suggested variation should take place only when there is some awkwardness such as ambiguity or noticeable monotony in the word avoided the substitute should be of a purely pronominal character a substitute and nothing more there should be no killing of two birds with one stone even when these two requirements are satisfied the variation is often worse because more noticeable than the monotony it is designed to avoid the examples in our first group do not offend against how far they offend against and how far they are objectionable on other grounds we shall consider in detail mr wolff the well known mining engineer yesterday paid a visit to the scene of the disaster the

tenderness of heart and a well stored vivid memory sir walter writing of her after his mother s death to lady louisa stewart says hutton his mother s is not only unnecessary but misleading there is a

association quoted a recent utterance of the president of the japanese house of peers that dignitary said spectator that dignitary said might have been omitted with the full stop before it mr sidney lee s study of the elizabethan sonnets the late mr charles elton s book on shakespeare s family and friends and professor bradley s on shakespearean tragedy a work which may be instructively read with professor campbell s tragic drama in aeschylus sophocles and shakespeare remind us that the dramatist still holds his own with the publishers the last two or three weeks have seen two new editions of him times the writer has thoroughly puzzled himself he can not call shakespeare shakespeare because there is a shakespeare just before he can not call him he because six other persons in the sentence have claims upon he and he ought not to call him the dramatist because aeschylus and sophocles were dramatists too we know of course which dramatist is meant just as we should have known which he was meant but the appropriation is awkward in either case the dramatist is no doubt the best thing under the circumstances but when matters are brought to such a pass that we can neither call a man by his own name nor use a pronoun nor identify him by means of his profession it is time to remodel the sentence if mr chamberlain has been injured by the fact that till now mr balfour has clung to him mr balfour has been equally injured by the fact that mr chamberlain has persistently locked his arm in that of the prime minister spectator elegant variation is the last thing we should expect here for what is the writer s principal object clearly to emphasize the idea of reciprocity by the repetition of names and by their arrangement mr chamberlain mr balfour mr balfour mr chamberlain it is easy enough so far if mr chamberlain has been injured by the persistent attachment of mr balfour mr balfour has been equally injured by that of mr chamberlain but that is not all that is required there is to be the graphic touch arm is to be locked in arm now comes the difficulty in whose arm are we to lock mr chamberlain s in his in his in his own in mr balfour s in that of the prime minister as the locking of arms is perhaps after all only an elegant variation for clinging remodelling seems again to be the best way out of the difficulty perhaps our simplified form above might serve on thursday evening last as a horse and cart were standing at mr brown s shop the animal bolted the horse an unconscious satirist of tender years but ripe discernment parsed animal in this sentence as a personal pronoun it replaced the subject of the sentence journalists it was explained to her are equipped with many more personal pronouns than ever get into the grammars the king yesterday morning made a close inspection of the cruiser drake at portsmouth and afterwards made a tour of the harbour on board the admiral s launch his majesty then landed and drove to southsea where he inspected the royal garrison artillery at clarence barracks the king returned to london in the course of the afternoon times this is no doubt a difficult case the royal pronoun his majesty does not lend itself to repetition on the other hand it is felt that he s if indulged in at all must be kept a respectful distance apart hence the king in the third sentence we can get rid of it by reading at clarence barracks returning but of course that solution would not always be possible the emperor received yesterday and to day general baron von beck it may therefore be assumed with some confidence that the terms of a feasible solution are maturing themselves in his majesty s mind and may form the basis of further negotiations with hungarian party leaders when the monarch goes again to budapest times if the emperor of austria should disappear from the scene war according to this authority is to be feared as the emperor francis joseph alone controls times there is no excuse either for the monarch or for the emperor francis joseph he could scarcely have been misinterpreted even in the latter sentence sir charles edward bernard had a long and distinguished career in the indian civil service five years later sir charles bernard was appointed commissioner of nagpur in sir edward bernard returned to nagpur times it is natural that sir charles edward bernard should be introduced to us under his full name natural also that an abbreviation should be chosen for working purposes but why two abbreviations if sir charles and he are judiciously employed they will last out to the end of the longest article without any assistance from sir edward among the instances here given there is scarcely one in which variation might not have been avoided with a little trouble there are some indeed in which it is not gratuitous and if in these the effect upon the reader were as negative as the writer s intention there would be nothing to complain of but it is not the artistic concealment of art is invariably wanting these elephantine shifts distract our attention from the matter in hand we can not follow his majesty s movements for wondering what the king will be called next time will it be plain edward vii or will something be done perhaps with the emperor of india when the choice lies between monotonous repetition on the one hand and clumsy variation on the other it may fairly be laid down that of two undesirable alternatives the natural is to be preferred to the artificial but variation of this kind is at the worst less offensive than that which in violation of our second principle above is employed as a medium for the conveyance of sprightly allusion mild humour or commonest of all parenthetic information when people looked at his head they felt he ought to have been a giant but he was far from rivalling the children of anak h caine far from it in fact he never fuddled himself with rum and water in his son s presence and only talked to his servants in a very

lines made fetched changed hands for went for produced elicited drew fell at accounted for realized and were knocked down for various sums inversion of all the types of inversion used by modern writers there is perhaps not one that could not be shown to exist in older english ordinary modern usage however has retained those forms only in which ancient authority combines with practical convenience and not all of those to set aside the verdict of time in this respect is to be archaic before using inversion therefore the novice should ask himself two questions is there any solid practical reason ornamental reasons will not do for tampering with the normal order of subject and verb and does the inversion sound natural throughout this section it must be borne in mind that in all questions of right and wrong inversion the final appeal is not to history but to the reader s perception what sounds right to most modern ears is right for modern purposes when under balance inversion we speak of a true and a false principle we do not mean to imply that the true principle was historically the origin of this kind of inversion or that the false is a mistaken analogy from it all that is meant is that if we examine a collection of instances those that sound natural will prove to be based upon the true principle and those that do not on the false a exclamatory inversion this may be regarded as an abbreviated form of exclamation as if the word how had dropped out at the beginning and a note of exclamation at the end the inverted order which is normal in the complete exclamation sounds natural also in the abbreviated form the requirements for this kind of inversion are these the intention must be genuinely exclamatory so that the full form of exclamation could be substituted without extravagance the word placed first must be that which would bear the chief emphasis in the uninverted form it should be observed that this is the only kind of inversion in which the emphatic word as such stands at the beginning our first three examples satisfy these conditions and are unobjectionable the fourth does not we could not substitute with what difficulty nor are the first words emphatic the emphasis is on conceive yet the inversion is inoffensive being in fact not exclamatory at all but a licensed extension of negative inversion which is treated below bitterly did i regret the perverse superstitious folly that had induced me to neglect so obvious a precaution but in these later times with so many disillusions with fresh problems confronting science as it advances rare must be the spirit of faith with which haeckel regards his work times gladly would he now have consented to the terms with difficulty can i conceive of a mental condition in which exclamatory inversion like everything else that is exclamatory should of course be used sparingly b balance inversion the following are familiar and legitimate types first on our list stands the question of local option on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets to this cause may be attributed among the guests were a b c z we give the name of balance to this kind of inversion because although the writer in inverting the sentence may not be distinctly conscious of rectifying its balance the fact that it was ill balanced before is the true cause of inversion it is a mistake to say that the words placed first in the above examples are so placed for the sake of emphasis that is a very common impression and is responsible for many unlawful inversions it is not emphasis that is given to these words it is protection they are placed there to protect them from being virtually annihilated as they would have been if left at the end look at the last of our examples how can we call the words among the guests were emphatic or say that they were placed there for emphasis they are essential words they show the connexion nor could the sentence be a sentence without them but they are as unemphatic as words could well be why then it may be asked are they put at the beginning is not this an emphatic position and does not any unusual position give emphasis no it gives not emphasis but prominence which is another thing put the sentence back into its original form and we shall see why inversion was desirable a b c d e f z were among the guests observe how miserably the sentence tails off it has no balance by inverting it we introduce several improvements first we give prominence to the unemphatic predicate and enable it to discharge its humble office that of a sign post indicating the connexion with what has gone before secondly by giving prominence to the predicate we give balance to the sentence which before was top heavy thirdly we give prominence to the subject by placing it in an unusual position next take the local option sentence are the words first on our list emphatic not if the inverter knows his business how did it run originally the question of local option stands first on our list these words might be meant to tell us either of two things what stood first on the list or where local option stood if the inversion is right they are meant to tell us what stood first if the other had been meant then first on the list would have been emphatic and the writer would have left it in its place but as it is not emphatic and the other words are the sentence is top heavy he therefore inverts it thus balancing the sentence and placing the unemphatic words in a prominent position where they continue to be unemphatic but are sure to be noticed in spoken language the relative importance of the different parts of a sentence can be indicated merely by the inflexion of the voice but the balance of the sentence is best maintained even then by means of inversion it is the same with the other examples if we restore the st matthew quotation to the uninverted form again we have an answer to either of two questions what is the basis of the law and what is the importance of these two commandments obviously it is meant as an answer to the latter and therefore the words that convey that answer are the emphatic words the others are not emphatic but merely essential to the connexion the general importance of the two commandments as forming the subject matter of the whole context does not in the slightest degree affect their relation to the other words in this particular sentence it follows from what has been said that true balance inversion is employed not for the sake of impressiveness but with the purely negative object of avoiding a bad balance the data required for its justification are i an emphatic subject carrying in itself the point of the sentence ii unemphatic sign post words essential to the connexion standing originally at the end of the sentence and there felt to be inadequately placed the results of the inversion must be iii that the sign post stands at the beginning iv that the subject stands absolutely at the end when these four conditions are fulfilled the inversion far from being objectionable may tend greatly to vigour and lucidity it is liable of course to be overdone but there are several ways of avoiding that sometimes it is possible to place the sign post at the beginning without inversion or the uninverted sentence may be reconstructed so that the subject no longer carries the emphasis and as often as not a sentence of which the accentuation is theoretically doubtful may in practice be left to the reader s discernment one occasional limitation remains to be mentioned before we proceed to instances it applies to those sentences only that have a compound verb if the compound verb can not be represented simply by its auxiliary component the inversion may have to be abandoned on account of the clumsiness of compound verbs in the middle of an inverted sentence for to carry the other component to the end would be to violate our fourth rule take the type sentence to these causes may be attributed and first let the subject be our disasters the clumsiness of the verb is then distinctly felt and to these causes may our disasters be attributed is ugly enough to show the importance of the rule it violates but next let the subject be every one of the disasters that have come upon us this time the inversion is satisfactory whence we conclude that if the verb is compound the subject must be long as well as emphatic or the inversion will not do on the answer to this question depends entirely every decision concerning the goodness or badness of conduct spencer just as after contact some molecules of a mass of food are absorbed by the part touched and excite the act of prehension so are absorbed such of its molecules as spreading through the water reach the organism spencer these are both formed on the right principle but the second suffers from the awkwardness of the auxiliary still more when considered in the concrete than when considered in the abstract do the views of hobbes and his disciples prove to be inconsistent spencer here we have neither the data that justify balance inversion nor the results that should follow from it it is due to the false principle of emphasis dealt with below in d and reads as awkwardly as such inversions usually read the sentence is no doubt cumbrous in the uninverted form but it wants reconstruction not inversion much deeper down than the history of the human race must we go to find the beginnings of these connections spencer wrong again for the same reasons but not with the same excuse for the original form is unobjectionable the emphasis is not on the problem to find but on the clue to it much deeper down which being emphatic can maintain its position at the end of the sentence the compound verb is only a secondary objection we do not mend matters much by substituting lie for must we go to find you say he is selfish well so is every one you say he is selfish well so is every one selfish so is every one is a correct inversion so is too weak to stand at the end and at the beginning it is a good enough sign post to tell us that selfishness is going to be defended but so is every one selfish is wrong for if selfish is repeated at all it is repeated with rhetorical effect and is strong enough to take care of itself our second rule is thus violated and so is our fourth the subject does not come at the end all three methods had their charm so may have mr yeats s notion of times this time the compound verb is fatal so perhaps has would do the arrival of the hartmanns created no little excitement in the falconet family both among the sons and the daughters especially was there no lack of speculation as to the character and appearance of miss hartmann beaconsfield right or wrong in principle this does not read comfortably but that may seem to be due to the cumbrous phrase was there no lack of which for practical purposes is a compound verb that difficulty we can remove without disturbing the accentuation of the sentence especially numerous were the speculations as to the character of miss hartmann this resembles in form our old type among the guests were but with the important difference that especially numerous is emphatic and can therefore stand at the end the inversion is rather explained than justified by the still stronger emphasis on miss hartmann sentences in which both subject and predicate are independently emphatic should be avoided quite apart from the question of inversion italics are more or less necessary to secure the inferior emphasis and italics are a confession of weakness somewhat lightened was the provincial panic by this proof that the murderer had not condescended to sneak into the country or to abandon for a moment under any motion of caution or fear the great metropolitan castra stativa of gigantic crime seated for ever on the thames de quincey the italics are his not a happy attempt we notice for one thing that the subject does not come at the end the inversion is not complete let us complete it to do so we must convey our huge sign post to the beginning by this proof thames was somewhat lightened the provincial panic worse than ever is the compound verb to blame remove it and see in consequence of this proof thames subsided in some degree the provincial panic this is not much better there is another and a worse flaw condition number one is not satisfied we want an emphatic subject that carries in itself the point of the sentence now we must not assume that because provincial is italicized therefore the subject however emphatic carries in itself the point of the sentence what is that point what imaginary question does the sentence answer can it be meant to answer the question what limitations were there upon the comfort derived from the intelligence that the murderer was still in london no that question could not be asked we have not yet been told that any comfort at all was derived the question it answers is what effect did this intelligence produce upon the general panic this question can be asked for the reader evidently knows that a panic had prevailed and that the intelligence had come if then we are to use balance inversion we must so reconstruct the sentence that the words containing the essential answer to this question become the subject we must change somewhat lightened into some alleviation from this proof thames resulted some alleviation of the provincial panic that is the best that inversion will do for us it is not quite satisfactory and the reason is that the sentence is made to do too much when the essential point is subject to an emphatic limitation an unemphatic one like somewhat does not matter the limitation ought to be conveyed in a separate sentence otherwise the sentence is overworked and either shirks its work with the result of obscurity or protests by means of italics we ought therefore to have from resulted some alleviation of the general panic this however was confined to the provinces but except for this incidental fault the sentence can be mended without inversion by this proof thames the provincial panic was somewhat lightened c inversion in syntactic clauses in clauses introduced by as than or a relative pronoun or adverb we have only a special case of balance inversion they differ from the instances considered above in this important respect that their relation to the preceding words is no longer paratactic but syntactic with the result that the sign post indicating this relation is necessarily placed at the beginning this will be seen from a comparison of the paratactic and syntactic forms in the following pairs of examples he was quick tempered so are most irishmen paratactic he was quick tempered as are most irishmen syntactic several difficulties now arose among them was several difficulties now arose among which was now in each of these sentences there are the same inducements to inversion in the syntactic form as in the paratactic and added to these is the necessity for placing the sign post at the beginning we might expect therefore that inversion of syntactic clauses would be particularly common but i we have already seen that inversion does not necessarily follow from the fact that the sign post is placed at the beginning and ii the verb in as and than clauses will probably from the nature of the case be the same as in the preceding clause if it is in the same mood and tense it can usually be omitted unless effective repetition is required in which case it will go to the end a change of mood or tense on the other hand will often be marked by an auxiliary itself perhaps compound which again will usually preclude inversion the result is this i relative clauses uninfluenced by the position of the sign post remain subject to precisely the same conditions as the corresponding paratactic sentences thus among whom were is right just as among the guests were was right among which would i mention is of course impossible because the subject does not carry the point and to which may be attributed is right or wrong according as the subject is or is not long enough to balance the compound verb ii inversion of an as or than clause having become unusual for the reason mentioned above is almost certain to look either archaic or clumsy clumsy when the reason for it is apparent archaic when it is not the practical rule is this if you can not omit the verb put it at the end and if you can neither omit it nor put it at the end reconstruct the sentence the german government was as anxious to upset m delcass as have been his bitterest opponents in france times the verb is preserved to avoid ambiguity but it should go to the end especially as it is compound relishing humour more than does any other people the americans could not be seriously angry bryce ambiguity can not fairly be pleaded here the verb should be omitted if france remains as firm as did england at that time she will probably have as much reason as had england to congratulate herself times either as england did or since the parallel is significant as england then remained also as england had st paul s writings are

improper e f benson this is like the case considered in b so is every one selfish if improper is repeated with rhetorical effect there is no need of inversion if not it should be left out there had been from time to time a good deal of interest over mrs emsworth s career the sort of interest which does more for a time in filling a theatre than would acting of a finer quality than hers have done e f benson either would have done at the end or perhaps better no verb at all all must join with me in the hope you express that as also must all hope that some good will come of times like the indiscriminate use of while this ungainly as connexion is popular with slovenly writers and is always aggravated by inversion all too must hope d negative inversion and false emphasis inversion the connexion here suggested between certain forms of inversion must be taken to represent not by any means the historical order of development with which we are not directly concerned but the order in which a modern writer may be supposed more or less unconsciously to adopt them starting from an isolated case of necessary inversion we proceed to extensions of it that seem natural and are sanctioned by modern usage and from these to other extensions based probably on a misunderstanding and producing in modern writers the effect of archaism nor except when used in conjunction with neither always stands first and if the subject appears at all the sentence is always inverted this requires no illustration on the analogy of nor many other negative words and phrases are thrown to the beginning of the sentence and again inversion is the result never had the cardinal s policy been more triumphantly vindicated nowhere is this so noticeable as in the south of france in no case can such a course be justified merely by success systems neither of which can be regarded as philosophically established but neither of which can we consent to surrender balfour two sorts of judgments neither of which can be deduced from the other and of neither of which can any proof be given balfour it is at this stage that misconception creeps in most of these negative phrases are in themselves emphatic and from their being placed first really on the analogy of nor comes the mistaken idea that they derive emphasis from their position this paves the way for wholesale inversion any words other than the subject are placed at the beginning and this not always in order to emphasize the words so placed but merely to give an impressive effect to the whole the various steps are marked by the instances that follow in the first two inversion may be on the analogy of negatives or may be designed for emphasis in the third emphasis is clearly the motive and in the rest we have mere impressiveness not to say mere

his story in some former age may do so for the sake of a purely superficial variety without any intention of troubling himself or his readers with temporal colour more than is necessary to avoid glaring absurdities he is then not concerned with archaism at all more commonly however it is part of his plan to present a living picture of the time of which he writes when this is the case he naturally feels bound to shun anachronism not only in externals but in thought and the expression of thought now with regard to the language of his characters it would be absurd for him to pretend to anything like consistent realism he probably has no accurate knowledge of the language as his characters would speak it and if he had this knowledge and used it he would be unintelligible to most of his readers and burdensome to the rest accordingly if he is wise he will content himself with keeping clear of such modes of expression as are essentially modern and have only modern associations such as would jar upon the reader s sense of fitness and destroy the time illusion he will aim that is to say at a certain archaic directness and simplicity but with the archaic vocabulary which instead of preserving the illusion only reminds us that there is an illusion to be preserved he will have little to do this we may call negative archaism esmond is an admirable example of it and the dame gossip part of mr meredith s amazing marriage is another it hardly occurs to us in these books that the language is archaic it is appropriate that is all the same may be said on the whole of treasure island and of one or two novels of besant s only the novelist who is not wise indulges in positive archaism he is actuated by the determination to have everything in character at all costs he does not know very much about old english of any period very few people do and those who know most of it would be the last to attempt to write a narrative in it he gives us however all that he knows without much reference to particular periods it may not be good ancient english but come what may it shall not be good modern this it need scarcely be said is not fair play the recreation is all on the writer s side archaism is no doubt very seductive to the archaist well done that is negatively done it looks easy and to do it badly is perhaps even easier than it looks no very considerable stock in trade is

may be added the indiscriminate use of nay and now by the rood c free inversion and verb terminations in st and th our list is largely drawn from stevenson who having tried negative archaism with success in treasure island chose to give us a positive specimen in the black arrow how vexatious these reach me down archaisms can become even in the hands of an able writer will be seen from the following examples of a single trick all taken from the black arrow an i had not been a thief i could not have painted me your face put me your hand into the corner and see what ye find there bring me him down like a ripe apple and keep ever forward master shelton turn me not back again an ye love your life selden take me this old shrew softly to the nearest elm and hang me him tenderly by the neck

track i slew him fair i ran me in upon his bow he cried swallow me a good draught of this said the knight it is like a child with a new toy but there is the opposite fault the judicious archaist as we have said will abstain from palpable modernisms especially from modern slang the following extracts are taken from an old woman s reminiscences of days in which a faultless attire included half high boots knee breeches very tight above the calf as the fashion was then a long tailed cutaway coat but the captain who of course lacks bowels of mercy for this kind of thing says that if he had been caesar caius would have got the great chuck yes madam i would have broke mister caius on the spot crockett but if you once go in for having a good time as miss anne in her innocence used to remark you must be prepared to crockett as all girls love to do when they are content with the way they have put in their time crockett metaphor strictly speaking metaphor occurs as often as we take a word out of its original sphere and apply it to new circumstances in this sense almost all words can be shown to be metaphorical when they do not bear a physical meaning for the original meaning of almost all words can be traced back to something physical in our first sentence above for instance there are eight different metaphors words had to be found to express mental perceptions abstract ideas and complex relations for which a primitive vocabulary did not provide and the obvious course was to convey the new idea by means of the nearest physical parallel the commonest latin verb for think is a metaphor from vine pruning seeing of the mind is borrowed from literal sight pondering is metaphorical weighing evidently these metaphors differ in intention and effect from such a phrase as smouldering discontent the former we may call for want of a better word natural metaphor as opposed to the latter which is artificial the word metaphor as ordinarily used suggests only the artificial kind but in deciding on the merits or demerits of a metaphorical phrase we are concerned as much with the one class as the other for in all doubtful cases our first questions will be what was the writer s intention in using the metaphor is it his own or is it common property if the latter did he use it consciously or unconsciously this distinction however is useful only as leading up to another we can not use it directly as a practical test artificial metaphors as well as natural ones often end by becoming a part of ordinary language when this has happened there is no telling to which class they belong and in english the question is complicated by the fact that our metaphorical vocabulary is largely borrowed from latin in the metaphorical state take such a word as explain its literal meaning is spread out flat how are we to say now whether necessity or picturesqueness first prompted its metaphorical use and the same doubt might arise centuries hence as to the origin of a phrase so obviously artificial to us as glaring inconsistency our practical distinction will therefore be between conscious or living and unconscious or dead metaphor whether natural or artificial in origin and again among living metaphors we shall distinguish between the intentional which are designed for effect and the unintentional which though still felt to be metaphors are used merely as a part of the ordinary vocabulary it may seem at first sight that this classification leaves us where we were how can we know whether a writer uses a particular metaphor consciously or unconsciously we can not know for certain it is enough if we think that he used it consciously and know that we should have used it consciously ourselves experience will tell us how far our perceptions in this respect differ from other people s most readers we think will agree in the main with our classification of the following instances they are taken at random from a couple of pages of the spectator these we should call dead his views were personal carry out his policy not acceptable to his colleagues the chancellor proposed some grounds for complaint refrain from talking about them the remission of the tea duty sound policy a speech almost entirely composed of extracts reduction of taxation discussion the low price of consols falls due succeeded will approach their task delivered a speech postponing to a future year the next are living but not intentional metaphor the writer is aware that his phrase is still picturesque in effect but has not chosen it for that reason a protestant atmosphere this would leave a margin of the loss of elasticity in the fund recasting our whole fiscal system to uphold the unity of the empire to strengthen the exchequer balances all dwelt on the grave injury his somewhat shattered authority the policy of evasion now pursued throws new light on the situation a gap in our fiscal system intentional metaphors are of course less plentiful the home rule motion designed to draw sir henry a dissolving view of general elections this reassuring declaration knocks the bottom out of the plea of urgency the scattered remnants of that party might rally after the disastrous defeat one or two general remarks may be made before we proceed to instances it is scarcely necessary to warn any one against over indulgence in intentional metaphor its effects are too apparent the danger lies rather in the use of live metaphor that is not intentional the many words and phrases that fall under this class are all convenient as often as not they are the first that occur and it is laborious sometimes impossible to hit upon an equivalent the novice will find it worth while however to get one whenever he can we may read a newspaper through without coming upon a single metaphor of this kind that is at all offensive in itself it is in the aggregate that they offend cries aloud for drop the curtain on goes hand in hand with a note of warning leaves its impress paves the way for heralds the advent of opens the door to are not themselves particularly noisy phrases but writers who indulge in them generally end by being noisy unintentional metaphor is the source too of most actual blunders every one is on his guard when his metaphor is intentional the nonsense that is talked about mixed metaphor and the celebrity of one or two genuine instances of it that come down to us from the eighteenth century have had that good effect there are few obvious faults a novice is more afraid of committing than this of mixed metaphor his fears are often groundless many a sentence that might have stood has been altered from a misconception of what mixed metaphor really is the following points should be observed if only one of the metaphors is a live one the confusion is not a confusion for practical purposes confusion can only exist between metaphors that are grammatically inseparable parallel metaphors between which there is no grammatical dependence can not result in confusion the novice must beware however of being misled either by punctuation or by a parallelism that does not secure grammatical independence thus no amount of punctuation can save the time honoured example i smell a rat i see him hovering in the air i will nip him in the bud him is inseparable from the later metaphors and refers to the rat but there is no confusion in the following passage any one of the metaphors can be removed without affecting the grammar this royal throne of kings this sceptred isle this earth of majesty this seat of mars this fortress built by nature for herself this happy breed of men this little world this precious stone set in the silver sea this blessed plot this earth this realm this england this nurse this teeming womb of royal kings metaphor within metaphor is dangerous here there is a grammatical dependence between the metaphors and if the combination is unsuitable confusion will result but combination is one thing and confusion is another if the internal metaphor is not inconsistent with the external there is no confusion though there may be ugliness to adapt one of our examples below the empire s butcher i e new zealand has not all his eggs in one basket is not a confusion because a metaphorical butcher can have his eggs in one basket as well as any one else what does lead to confusion is the choice of an internal metaphor applicable not to the words of the external metaphor but to the literal words for which it is substituted in the following example the confusion is doubtless intended this pillar of the state hath swallowed hook and bait the swallowing is applicable only to the person metaphorically called a pillar confusion of metaphor is sometimes alleged against sentences that contain only one metaphor a manifest absurdity these are really cases of a clash between the metaphorical and the non metaphorical a striking or original metaphor is apt to appear violent and a commonplace one impertinent if not adequately borne out by the rest of the sentence this we may label unsustained metaphor it sometimes produces much the same effect as mixed metaphor but the remedy for it as well as the cause is different mixed metaphor is the result of negligence and can generally be put right by a simple adaptation of the language to whichever metaphor is to be retained unsustained metaphor is rather an error of judgement it is unsustained either because it was difficult to sustain or because it was not worth sustaining in either case abandonment is the simplest course this diverting incident contributed in a high degree to the general merriment here we have four different metaphors but as they are all dead there is no real confusion this as you know was a burning question and its unseasonable introduction threw a chill on the spirits of all our party burning and chill are both live metaphors they are grammatically connected by its and they are inconsistent there is therefore confusion the uncertainty which hangs over every battle extends in a special degree to battles at sea spectator extends is usually dead and if in this case it is living it is also suitable a centre and nucleus round which the scattered remnants of that party might rally after the disastrous defeat spectator the main or external metaphor is that of an army now any metaphor that is applicable to a literal army is also applicable to a metaphorical one but rally round a nucleus is a confusion of metaphor to whichever it is applied it requires us to conceive of the army at the same time as animal and vegetable nucleus being literally the kernel of a nut and metaphorically a centre about which growth takes place an army can have a nucleus but can not rally round it sir w laurier had claimed for canada that she would be the granary and baker of the empire and sir edmund barton had claimed for australia that she would be the empire s butcher but in new zealand they had not all their eggs in one basket and they could claim a combination of the three this is quoted in a newspaper as an example of mixed metaphor it is nothing of the kind they in new zealand are detached from the metaphor we move slowly and cautiously from old moorings in our english life that is our laudable constitutional habit but my belief is that the great majority of moderate churchmen to whatever political party they may belong desirous as they are to lift this question of popular education out of the party rut a rut says the same newspaper is about the very last thing we should expect to find at sea despite the fact that it is ploughed there is no mention of ruts at sea the two metaphors are independent if the speaker had said moderate churchmen moving at length from their old moorings are beginning to lift this question out of the party rut we should have had a genuine confusion the moorings and the rut being then inseparable both this sentence and the preceding one the reader may think would have been better without the second metaphor we agree but it is a question of taste not of correctness the keenest incentive man can feel to remedy ignorance and abolish guilt it is under the impelling force of this incentive that civilization progresses spectator this illustrates the danger of deciding hastily on the deadness of a metaphor however common it may be probably any one would have said that the musical idea in incentive had entirely vanished but the successive attributes keenness and impelling force are too severe a test the dead metaphor is resuscitated and a perceptible confusion results her forehand drive her most trenchant asset daily mail another case of resuscitation trenchant turns in its grave and asset ready to succumb under the violence of athletic reporters has yet life enough to resent the imputation of a keen edge as the critic of ruts at sea might have observed the more blunt the better the assets and the very fact that the past is beyond recall imposes upon the present generation a continual stimulus to strive for the prevention of such woes spectator we impose a burden we apply a stimulus it looks as if the writer had meant by a short cut to give us both ideas if so his guilt is clear and if we call impose a mere slip in idiom the confusion is none the less apparent sword of the devil running with the blood of saints poisoned adder thy work is done these are independent metaphors and as thy work is done is applicable to each of them there is no confusion in the hope that something might be done even at the eleventh hour to stave off the brand of failure from the hide of our military administration times to stave off a brand is not perhaps impossible but we suspect that it would be a waste of energy the idea of bulk is inseparable from the process of staving off the metaphor is usually applied to literal abstract nouns not to metaphorical concretes ruin and disaster one can suppose to be of a tolerable size but a metaphorical brand does not present itself to the imagination as any larger than a literal one we assume that by brand the instrument is meant the eleventh hour is all too early to set about staving off the mark this is a good example of mixed metaphor of the more pronounced type it differs only in degree from some of those considered above we suggested that impose a stimulus was perhaps a short cut to the expression of two different metaphors and the same might be said of staving off the brand but we shall get a clearer idea of the nature of mixed metaphor if we regard all these as violations of the following simple rule when a live metaphor intentional or unintentional has once been chosen the words grammatically connected with it must be either a recognizable parts of the same metaphorical idea or one consistent with it or b unmetaphorical or dead metaphor literal abstract nouns for instance instead of metaphorical concretes thus we shall impose not the stimulus but either a the burden of resistance or b the duty of resistance and we shall stave off not the brand but the ignominy of failure from our military administration but from our remarks in above it will be clear that b though it can not result in confusion of metaphor may often leave the metaphor unsustained our examples illustrate several common types is it not a little difficult to ask for liberal votes for unionist free traders if we put party interests in the front of the consideration spectator may i be allowed to add a mite of experience of an original volunteer in a good city regiment spectator but also in italy many ancient edifices have been recently coated with stucco and masked by superfluous repairs spectator the elementary schools are hardly to be blamed for this failure their aim and their achievement

of dilemmas will call this not unsustained metaphor but a gross confusion horns can not be said to screw we prefer to believe that de quincey was not thinking of the horns at all they are a gratuitous metaphorical ornament dilemma in english at any rate is a literal word and means an argument that presents two undesirable alternatives the circumstances of a dilemma are indeed such as to prompt metaphorical language but the word itself is incorrigibly literal we confess as much by clapping horns on its head and making them do the metaphorical work these remarks have been dictated in order that the importance of recognizing the difference and the value of soils may be understood j long this metaphor always requires that the dictator usually a personified abstract should be mentioned dictated by the importance the opposite fault of over conscientiousness must also be noticed elaborate poetical metaphor has perhaps gone out of fashion but technical metaphor is apt to be overdone

proper audit of public accounts times repetition rhetorical or to use at once a wider and a more intelligible term significant repetition is a valuable element in modern style used with judgement it is as truly a good thing as clumsy repetition the result of negligence is bad but there are some writers who from the fact that all good repetition is intentional rashly infer that all intentional repetition is good and others who may be suspected of making repetitions from negligence and retaining them from a misty idea that to be aware of a thing is to have intended it even when the repetition is a part of the writer s original plan consideration is necessary before it can be allowed to pass it is implied in the terms rhetorical or significant repetition that the words repeated would ordinarily be either varied or left out the repetition that is to say is more or less abnormal and whatever is abnormal may be objectionable in a single instance and is likely to become so if it occurs frequently the writers who have most need of repetition and are most justified in using it are those whose chief business it is to appeal not to the reader s emotions but to his understanding for in spite of the term rhetorical the object ordinarily is not impressiveness for impressiveness sake but emphasis for the sake of clearness it may seem indeed that a broad distinction ought to be drawn between the rhetorical and the non rhetorical they differ in origin and in aim one being an ancient rhetorical device to secure impressiveness the other a modern development called forth by the requirements of popular writers on subjects that demand lucidity and there is the further difference that rhetorical repetition often dictates the whole structure of the sentence whereas the non rhetorical in its commonest form is merely the completion of a sentence that need not have been completed but in practice the two things become inseparable and we shall treat them together only pointing out to the novice that of the two motives impressiveness and lucidity the latter is far the more likely to seem justifiable in the reader s eyes we shall illustrate both the good and bad points of repetition almost exclusively from a few pages of bagehot one of its most successful exponents in whom nevertheless it degenerates into mannerism to a writer who has so much to say that is worth hearing almost anything can be forgiven that makes for clearness and in him clearness vigour and a certain pleasant rapidity all result from the free use of repetition it will be seen that his repetitions are not of the kind properly called rhetorical it is the spontaneous fullness of a writer who having a clear point to make is determined to make it clearly elegance or no elegance yet the growth of mannerism is easily seen in him the justifiable repetitions are too frequent and he has some that do not seem justifiable he analysed not a particular government but what is common to all governments not one law but what is common to all laws not political communities in their features of diversity but political communities in their features of necessary resemblance he gave politics not an interesting aspect but a new aspect for by giving men a steady view of what political communities must be he nipped in the bud many questions as to what they ought to be as a gymnastic of the intellect and as a purifier mr austin s philosophy is to this day admirable even in its imperfect remains a young man who will study it will find that he has gained something which he wanted but something which he did not know that he wanted he has clarified a part of his mind which he did not know needed clarifying all these powers were states of some magnitude and some were states of great magnitude they would be able to go on as they had always gone on to shift for themselves as they had always shifted without spanish and without french walpole would have made a good peace bolingbroke could not do so with both cold men may be wild in life and not wild in mind but warm and eager men fit to be the favourites of society and fit to be great orators will be erratic not only in conduct but in judgement a man like walpole or a man like louis napoleon is protected by an unsensitive nature from intellectual destruction after a war which everyone was proud of we concluded a peace which nobody was proud of in a manner that everyone was ashamed of he hated the city because they were whigs and he hated the dutch because he had deserted them but he professed to know nothing of commerce and did know nothing the fierce warlike disposition of the english people would not have endured such dishonour we may doubt if it would have endured any peace it certainly would not have endured the best peace unless it were made with dignity and with honesty using the press without reluctance and without cessation he ought to have been able to bear anything yet he could bear nothing he prosecuted many more persons than it was usual to prosecute then and far more than have been prosecuted since he thought that everything should be said for him and that nothing should be said against him between these fluctuated the great mass of the tory party who did not like the house of hanover because it had no hereditary right who did not like the pretender because he was a roman catholic he had no popularity little wish for popularity little respect for popular judgement here is a writer who at any rate has not the vice of elegant variation most of the possibilities of repetition for good and for evil are here represented as bagehot himself might have said we have instances of repetition that are good in themselves we have instances of repetition that are bad in themselves and we have instances of repetition that are neither particularly good nor particularly bad in themselves but that offend simply by recurrence the ludicrous appearance presented by our collection as a whole necessarily obscures the merit of individual cases but if the reader will consider each sentence by itself he will see that repetition is often a distinct improvement the point best illustrated here no doubt is that it impossible to have too much of a good thing but it is a good thing for all that as instances of unjustifiable mannerism we may select fit to be the favourites and fit to be great orators not political communities but political communities something which he wanted but something which he did not know that he wanted a man like walpole or a man like louis napoleon without reluctance and without cessation who did not like who did not like and without spanish and without french we have mentioned clearness as the ultimate motive for repetition of this kind in this last sentence we get not clearness but obscurity any one would suppose that there was some point in the distinction between spanish and french there is none the point is simply that languages do not make a statesman again there is sometimes virtue in half measures from something which he did not know that he wanted remove the first three words and there remains quite repetition enough wild in life and not wild in mind is a repetition that is clearly called for but it is followed by the wholly gratuitous fit and fit and the result is disastrous finally in who did not like who did not like mannerism gets the upper hand altogether instead of the appearance of natural vigour that ordinarily characterizes the writer we have stiff lumbering artificiality writers like bagehot do not tend at all to impressive repetition their motive is always the business like one of lucidity though it is sometimes lucidity run mad repetition of this kind not being designed to draw the reader s attention to itself wears much better in practice than the more pronounced types of rhetorical repetition the latter should be used very sparingly as the spontaneous expression of strong feeling in the writer it is sometimes justified by circumstances employed as a deliberate artifice to impress the reader it is likely to be frigid and to fail in its object and the term rhetorical should remind us in either case that what may be spoken effectively will not always bear the test of writing rhetorical repetition when it is clearly distinguishable from the non rhetorical is too obvious to require much illustration of the three instances given the last is an excellent test case for the principle that whatever is intentional is good i have summoned you here to witness your own work i have summoned

section were of a humorous tendency we may add here some expressions of another kind all of them calculated in one way or another to save the writer trouble the trouble of description or of producing statistics or of thinking what he means such phrases naturally die hard even more easily imagined than described still survives the rough handling it has met with and flourishes in writers of a

rational contexts the phrase has somehow got a bad name for prefacing fallacies and for begging questions it lacks the delicious candour of its feminine equivalent kindly allow me to know best but appeals perhaps not less irresistibly to the generosity of an opponent apart from this there is a correct and an incorrect use of the words it is of course the conclusion drawn from certain premisses

ordinated with it by and my dear fellow it stands to reason that if the square of a is a squared and the square of b is b squared then the square of a minus b is a squared minus b squared you may

it stands to reason that russia though vast is a poor country that the war must cost immense sums and that there must come a time spectator just as stands to reason is not an argument but an invitation to believe the worthy major not amusing but an invitation to smile so the sentimental or sensational novelist has his special vocabulary of the impressive the tender the tragic and the horrible one or two of the more obvious catch phrases may be quoted in the strong man of fiction the reader may have observed a growing tendency to sob like a child the right minded hero to whom temptation comes decides with archaic rectitude that he will not do this thing the villain taught by incessant ridicule to abstain from muffled curses finds a vent in discordant laughs that somehow jarred unpleasantly upon my nerves this laugh mutatis mutandis cruel little laugh that somehow he shares with the heroine who for her exclusive perquisite has this man who had somehow come into her life somehow and half dazed are invaluable for throwing a mysterious glamour over situations and characters that shun the broad daylight of common sense b elementary irony a well known novelist speaks of the resentment that children feel against those elders who insist upon addressing them in a jocular tone as if serious conversation between the two were out of the question irony is largely open to the same objection the writer who uses it is taking our intellectual measure he forgets our ex officio perfection in wisdom theoretically indeed the reader is admitted to the author s confidence he is not the corpus vile on which experiment is made that however is scarcely more convincing than the two edged formula present company excepted for minute detailed illustration of truths that have had the misfortune to become commonplaces without making their due impression sustained irony has its legitimate use tired of being told and shown by direct methods that only the virtuous man is admirable we are glad enough to go off with fielding on a brisk reductio ad absurdum for if not let some other kind of man be admirable as jonathan wild but the reductio process should be kept for emergencies as euclid kept it with whom it is a confession that direct methods are not available the isolated snatches of irony quoted below have no such justification they are for ornament not for utility and it is a kind of ornament that is peculiarly un english a way of shrugging one s shoulders in print he had also the comfortable reflection that by the violent quarrel with lord dalgarno he must now forfeit the friendship and good offices of that nobleman s father and sister scott naturally that reference was received with laughter by the opposition who are or profess to be convinced that our

giving systematic positive directions or attempting to cover all ground familiar and unfamiliar important or not but drawing attention only to the most prevalent mistakes on so technical a subject however a few preliminary remarks may be made and to those readers who would prefer a systematic treatise beadnell s spelling and punctuation wyman s technical series menken may be recommended we shall refer to it occasionally in what follows and the examples to which b is attached instead of an author s name are taken from it these are all given in beadnell unless the contrary is stated as examples of correct punctuation it should be added that the book is written rather from the compositor s than from the author s point of view and illustrates the compositor s natural weaknesses it is more important to him for instance that a page should not be unsightly the unsightliness being quite imaginary and the result of professional conservatism than that quotation marks and stops or dashes and stops should be arranged in their true significant order but as the right and unsightly is candidly given as well as the wrong and beautiful this does not matter the student can take his choice we shall begin by explaining how it is that punctuation is a difficult matter and worth a writer s serious attention there are only six stops comma semicolon colon full stop question mark exclamation mark or with the dash seven the work of three of them full stop question exclamation is so clear that mistakes about their use can hardly occur without gross carelessness and it might be thought that with the four thus left it ought to be a very simple matter to exhaust all possibilities in a brief code of rules it is not so however apart from temporary disturbing causes of which two now operative are the gradual disappearance of the colon in its old use with the decay of formal periodic arrangement and the encroachments of the dash as a saver of trouble and an exponent of emotion there are also permanent difficulties before mentioning these we observe that the four stops in the strictest acceptation of the word for and are tones rather than stops form a series it might be expressed also by each member of which directs us to pause for so many units of time before proceeding there is essentially nothing but a quantitative time relation between them the first difficulty is that this single distinction has to convey to the reader differences of more than one kind and not commensurable it has to do both logical and rhetorical work its logical work is helping to make clear the grammatical relations between parts of a sentence or paragraph and the whole or other parts its rhetorical work is contributing to emphasis heightening effect and regulating pace it is in vain that beadnell lays it down the variation of pause between the words of the same thought is a matter of rhetoric and feeling but punctuation depends entirely upon the variation of relations upon logical and grammatical principles the difference between these two the master beat the scholar with a strap b the master beat the scholar with a strap is in logic nothing but in rhetoric it is the difference between matter of fact statement and indignant statement a strap we are to understand from the comma is a barbarous instrument again in the two following examples so far as logic goes commas would be used in both or semicolons in both but the writer of the second desires to be slow staccato and impressive the writer of the first desires to be rapid and flowing or rather perhaps does not desire to be anything other than natural mathematicians have sought knowledge in figures philosophers in systems logicians in subtilties and metaphysicians in sounds b in the eclogue there must be nothing rude or vulgar nothing fanciful or affected nothing subtle or abstruse b the difference is rhetorical not logical it is true however that modern printers make an effort to be guided by logic or grammar alone it is impossible for them to succeed entirely but any one who will look at an elizabethan book with the original stopping will see how far they have moved the old stopping was frankly to guide the voice in reading aloud while the modern is mainly to guide the mind in seeing through the grammatical construction a perfect system of punctuation then that should be exact and uniform would require separate rhetorical and logical notations in the first place such a system is not to be desired the point is only that without it usage must fluctuate according as one element is allowed to interfere with the other but a second difficulty remains even if we assume that rhetoric could be eliminated altogether our stop series as explained above provides us with four degrees but the degrees of closeness and remoteness between the members of sentence or paragraph are at the least ten times as many it is easy to show that the comma even in its purely logical function has not one but many tasks to do which differ greatly in importance take the three examples his method of handling the subject was ornate learned and perspicuous b the removal of the comma after learned makes so little difference that it is an open question among compositors whether it should be used or not the criminal who had betrayed his associates was a prey to remorse with the commas the criminal is necessarily a certain person already known to us without them we can only suppose a past state of society to be described in which all traitors were ashamed of themselves a difference of some importance colonel hutchinson the governor whom the king had now appointed having hardened his heart resolved on sterner measures omission of the comma after appointed gives us two persons instead of one and entirely changes the meaning making the central words into what they could not possibly be with the comma an absolute construction these commas that is have very different values many intermediate degrees might be added similarly the semicolon often separates grammatically complete sentences but often also the mere items of a list and between these extremes it marks other degrees of separation a perfect system for the merely logical part of punctuation then would require some scores of stops instead of four this again is not a thing to be desired how little is clear from the fact that one of our scanty supply the colon is now practically disused as a member of the series and turned on to useful work at certain odd jobs that will be mentioned later a series of stops that should really represent all gradations might perhaps be worked by here and there a writer consistently with himself but to persuade all writers to observe the same distinctions would be hopeless a third difficulty is this not only must many tasks be performed by one stop the same task is necessarily performed by different stops according to circumstances as if polygamy were not bad enough it is complicated by an admixture of polyandry we have already given two sentences of nearly similar pattern one of which had its parts separated by commas the other by semicolons and we remarked that the difference was there accounted for by the intrusion of rhetoric but the same thing occurs even when logic or grammar it should be explained that grammar is sometimes defined as logic applied to speech so that for our purposes the two are synonymous is free from the disturbing influence or when that influence acts directly not on the stop itself that is in question but only on one of its neighbours to illustrate the first case when the stops are not affected by rhetoric but depend on grammar alone we may take a short sentence as a nucleus elaborate it by successive additions and observe how a particular stop has to go on increasing its power though it continues to serve only the same purpose because it must keep its predominance when ambition asserts the monstrous doctrine of millions made for individuals is not the good man indignant the function of the comma is to mark the division between the subordinate and the main clauses when ambition asserts the monstrous doctrine of millions made for individuals their playthings to be demolished at their caprice is not the good man indignant the semicolon is doing now exactly what the comma did before but as commas have intruded into the clause to do the humble yet necessary work of marking two appositions the original comma has to dignify its relatively more important office by converting itself into a semicolon when ambition asserts the monstrous doctrine of millions made for individuals their playthings to be demolished at their caprice sporting wantonly with the rights the peace the comforts the existence of nations as if their intoxicated pride would if possible make god s earth their football is not the good man indignant b the new insertion is also an apposition like the former ones but as it contains commas within itself it must be raised above their level by being allowed a semicolon to part it from them the previous semicolon still having the same supreme task to do and challenged by an upstart rival has nothing for it but to change the regal for the imperial crown and become a colon a careful observer will now object that on these principles our new insertion ought to have had an internal semicolon to differentiate the subordinate clause as if c from the mere enumeration commas that precede in which case the semi colon after caprice should be raised to a colon and then what is the newly created emperor to do there is no papal tiara for him to assume the full stop being confined to the independent sentence the objection is quite just and shows how soon the powers of the four stops are exhausted if relentlessly worked but we are concerned only to notice that the effect of stops even logically considered is relative not absolute it is also true that many modern writers if they put down a sentence like this would be satisfied with using commas throughout the old fashioned air of the colon will hardly escape notice but the whole arrangement is according to the compositor s art in its severer form a specimen of the merely indirect action of rhetoric may be more shortly disposed of in a sentence already quoted mathematicians have sought knowledge in figures philosophers in systems logicians in subtilties and metaphysicians in sounds suppose the writer to have preferred for impressive effect as we said he might have to use semicolons instead of commas the immediate result of that would be that what before could be left to the reader to do for himself i e the supplying of the words have sought knowledge in each member will in presence of the semicolon require to be done to the eye by commas and the sentence will run mathematicians have sought knowledge in figures philosophers in systems logicians in subtilties and metaphysicians in sounds but lest we should be thought too faithful followers of the logicians we will now assume that our point has been sufficiently proved the difficulties of punctuation owing to the interaction of different purposes and the inadequacy of the instruments are formidable enough to be worth grappling with we shall now only make three general remarks before proceeding to details the first is implied in what has been already said the work of punctuation is mainly to show or hint at the grammatical relation between words phrases clauses and sentences but it must not be forgotten that stops also serve to regulate pace to throw emphasis on particular words and give them significance and to indicate tone these effects are subordinate and must not be allowed to conflict with the main object but as the grammatical relation may often be shown in more than one way that way can be chosen which serves another purpose best secondly it is a sound principle that as few stops should be used as will do the work there is a theory that scientific or philosophic matter should be punctuated very fully and exactly whereas mere literary work can do with a much looser system this is a mistake except so far as scientific and philosophic writers may desire to give an impressive effect by retarding the pace that is legitimate but otherwise all that is printed should have as many stops as help the reader and not more a resolution to put in all the stops that can be correctly used is very apt to result in the appearance of some that can only be used incorrectly some of our quotations from huxley and mr balfour may be thought to illustrate this and whereas slight stopping may venture on small irregularities full stopping that is incorrect is also unpardonable the objection to full stopping that is correct is the discomfort inflicted upon readers who are perpetually being checked like a horse with a fidgety driver thirdly every one should make up his mind not to depend on his stops they are to be regarded as devices not for saving him the trouble of putting his words into the order that naturally gives the required meaning but for saving his reader the moment or two that would sometimes without them be necessarily spent on reading the sentence twice over once to catch the general arrangement and again for the details it may almost be said that what reads wrongly if the stops are removed is radically bad stops are not to alter meaning but merely to show it up those who are learning to write should make a practice of putting down all they want to say without stops first what then on reading over naturally arranges itself contrary to the intention should be not punctuated but altered and the stops should be as few as possible consistently with the recognized rules at this point those rules should follow but adequately explained and illustrated they would require a volume and we can only speak of common abuses and transgressions of them first comes what may be called for short the spot plague the tendency to make full stops do all the work the comma most important if slightest of all stops can not indeed be got rid of though even for that the full stop is substituted when possible but the semicolon is now as much avoided by many writers as the colon in its old use by most with the semicolon go most of the conjunctions now there is something to be said for the change or the two changes the old fashioned period or long complex sentence carefully worked out with a view to symmetry balance and degrees of subordination though it has a dignity of its own is formal stiff and sometimes frigid the modern newspaper vice of long sentences either rambling or involved far commoner in newspapers than the spot plague is inexpressibly wearisome and exasperating simplification is therefore desirable but journalists now and then and writers with more literary ambition than ability generally overdo the thing till it becomes an affectation it is then little different from victor hugo s device of making every sentence a paragraph and our last state is worse than our first patronizing archness sham ingenuousness spasmodic interruption scrappy argument dry monotony are some of the resulting impressions we shall have to trouble the reader with at least one rather long specimen the spot plague in its less virulent form that is when it is caused not by pretentiousness or bad taste but merely by desire to escape from the period does not declare itself very rapidly what follows is a third or so of a literary review of which the whole is in exactly the same style and which might have been quoted entire for the same purpose it will be seen that it shows twenty full stops to one semicolon and no colons further between no two of the twenty sentences is there a conjunction the life of lord chatham which has just appeared in three volumes by dr albert v ruville of the university of halle deserves special notice it is much the most complete life which has yet appeared of one of the most commanding figures in english history it exhibits that thoroughness of method which characterized german historical writings of other days and which has not lately been conspicuous it is learned without being dull and is free from that uncritical spirit of hostility to england which impairs the value of so many recent german histories that portion which deals with the closing years of george ii and with events following the accession of george iii is exceptionally interesting one of the greatest misfortunes that ever happened to england was the resignation of pitt in it was caused as we all know by difference of opinion with his colleagues on the spanish question ferdinand vi of spain died in and was succeeded by king charles iii one of the most remarkable princes of the house of bourbon this sovereign was an enthusiastic adherent of the policy which found expression in the celebrated family compact on august a secret convention was concluded between france and spain under which spain engaged to declare war against england in may pitt quite understood the situation he saw that instant steps should be taken to meet the danger and proposed at a cabinet held on october that war should be declared against spain newcastle hardwicke anson bute and mansfield combated this proposal which was rejected and two days afterwards pitt resigned his scheme was neither immature nor ill considered he had made his preparations to strike a heavy blow at the enemy to seize the isthmus of panama thereby securing a port in the pacific and separating the spanish provinces of mexico and peru he had planned an expedition against havana and the philippine islands where no adequate resistance could have been made and had he remained in office there is but little doubt that the most precious possessions of spain in the new world would have been incorporated in the british empire when he left the cabinet all virility seems to have gone out of it with him as he had foreseen spain declared war on england at a suitable moment for herself and the unfortunate negotiations were opened leading to the peace of paris in which was pregnant with many disastrous results for england the circumstances which led to the resignation of pitt are dealt with by dr v ruville much more lucidly than by most historians this portion of his work is the more interesting because of the pains he takes to clear george iii from the charge of conspiring against his great minister times the reader s experience has probably been that the constant fresh starts are at first inspiriting that about half way he has had quite enough of the novelty and that he is intensely grateful when the solitary semicolon comes into sight for a momentary lapse into ordinary gentle progress writers like this may almost be suspected of taking literally a summary piece of advice that we have lately seen in a book on english composition never use a semicolon when you can employ a full stop beadnell lays down a law that at first sight seems to amount to the same thing the notion of parting short independent sentences otherwise than by a full stop rests upon no rational foundation and leads to endless perplexities but his practice clears him of the imputation he is saved by the ambiguity of the word independent there are grammatical dependence and dependence of thought of all those little hard round unconnected things in the times review that seem to come upon one as shot would descend from a shot making tower sir arthur helps hardly one is not dependent on its neighbours in the more liberal sense though each is a complete sentence and independent in grammar now one important use of stops is to express the degrees of thought dependence a style that groups several complete sentences together by the use of semicolons because they are more closely connected in thought is far more restful and easy for the reader that is than the style that leaves him to do the grouping for himself and yet it is free from the formality of the period which consists not of grammatically independent sentences but of a main sentence with many subordinate clauses we have not space for a long example of the group system rightly applied most good modern writers free from the craving to be up to date will supply them on every page but a very short quotation may serve to emphasize the difference between group and spot plague principles the essence of the latter is that almost the only stops used are full stops and commas that conjunctions are rare and that when a conjunction does occur the comma is generally used not the full stop what naturally follows is an arrangement of this kind the sheil of ravensnuik was for the present at least at his disposal the foreman or grieve at the home farm was anxious to be friendly but even if he lost that place dan weir knew that there was plenty of others crockett to save trouble let it be stated that the sheil is a dependency of the home farm and not contrasted with or opposed to it here there are three grammatically independent sentences between the two latter of which the conjunction but is inserted it follows from spot plague principles that there will be a full stop at the end of the first and a comma at the end of the second with the group system it is not so simple a matter before we can place the stops we have to inquire how the three sentences are connected in thought it then appears that the friendliness of the grieve is mentioned to account for the sheil s being at disposal that is there is a close connexion though no conjunction between the first and the second sentences further the birds in the bush of the third sentence are contrasted not with the second sentence s friendliness but with the first sentence s bird in the hand which however is accounted for by the second sentence s friendliness to group rightly then we must take care quite reversing the author s punctuation that the first and second are separated by a stop of less power than that which separates the third from them comma semicolon would do it if the former were sufficient between two grammatically independent sentences not joined by a conjunction it obviously is not sufficient here though in some such pairs it might be so instead of comma semicolon we must use semicolon full stop and the sentence will run with its true meaning much more clearly given the sheil of ravensnuik was for the present at least at his disposal the foreman or grieve at the home farm was anxious to be friendly but even if he lost that place dan weir knew that there was plenty of others the group system gives more trouble to the writer or compositor and less to the reader the compositor can not be expected to like it if the burden falls on him inferior writers can not be expected to choose it either perhaps but the good writers who do choose it no doubt find that after a short time the work comes to do itself by instinct we need now only add two or three short specimens worse though from their shortness less remarkable than the times extract they are not specially selected as bad but it may be hoped that by their juxtaposition they may have some deterrent effect so dan opened the door a little and the dog came out as if nothing had happened it was now clear the light was that of late evening the air hardly

you have to be interested or appear to be interested in other people and there are so many in this world in whom it is impossible to be interested so many for whom the most skilful hypocrisy can not help us to maintain a semblance of interest daily telegraph of course a girl so pretty as my miss anne could not escape having many suitors especially as all over the countryside sir tempest had the name of being something of a skinflint and skinflints are always rich as is well known crockett the last sentence here is a mere comment on what is itself only an appendage the clause introduced by especially it has therefore no right to the dignity of a separate sentence but it can hardly be mended without some alteration of words as well as stops for instance put a semicolon after suitors write moreover for especially as and put only a comma after skinflint the right proportion would then be secured the spot plague as we have shown sometimes results in illogicality it need not do so however when it does the fault lies with the person who accepting its principles does not arrange his sentences to suit them it is a new fashioned and in our opinion unpleasant system but quite compatible with correctness over stopping to which we now proceed is on the contrary old fashioned but it is equally compatible with correctness though old fashioned it still lingers obstinately enough to make some slight protest desirable the superstition that every possible stop should be inserted in scientific and other such writing misleads compositors and their example affects literary authors who have not much ear any one who finds himself putting down several commas close to one another should reflect that he is making himself disagreeable and question his conscience as severely as we ought to do about disagreeable conduct in real life whether it is necessary he will find that the parenthetic or emphatic effect given to an adverbial phrase by putting a comma at each end of it is often of no value whatever to his meaning in other words that he can make himself agreeable by merely putting off a certain pompous solemnity erasing a pair of commas may make the difference in writing that is made in conversation by a change of tone from the didactic to the courteous sometimes the abundance of commas is not so easily reduced a change in the order of words the omission of a needless adverb or conjunction even the recasting of a sentence may be necessary but it is a safe statement that a gathering of commas except on certain lawful occasions as in a list is a suspicious circumstance the sentence should at least be read aloud and if it halts or jolts some change or other should be made the smallest portion possible of curious interest had been awakened within me and at last i asked myself within my own mind borrow none of the last three commas is wanted those round at last are very unpleasant and they at least should be omitted in questions of trade and finance questions which owing perhaps to their increasing intricacy seem bryce perhaps can do very well without commas it is however already plain enough that unless indeed some great catastrophe should upset all their calculations the authorities have very little intention times indeed can do without commas if it can not itself be done without jeannie too is just occasionally like a good girl out of a book by a sentimental lady novelist times if just is omitted there need be no commas round occasionally there may be a value in just but hardly enough to compensate for the cruel jerking at the bit to which the poor reader is subjected by a remorseless driver thus their work however imperfect and faulty judged by modern lights it may have been brought them face to face with huxley the comma after thus is nothing if not pompous and another can be got rid of by putting it may have been before judged by modern lights lilias suggested the advice which of all others seemed most suited to the occasion that yielding namely to the circumstances of their situation they should watch scott omit namely and its commas shakespeare it is true had as i have said as respects england the privilege which only first comers enjoy lowell a good example of the warning value of commas none of these can be dispensed with since there are no less than three parenthetic qualifications to the sentence but the crowd of commas ought to have told the writer how bad his sentence was it is like an obstacle race it should begin it is true that which disposes of one obstacle as i have said can be given a separate sentence afterwards so much has been said before private banks and capitalists constitute the main bulk of the subscribers and apparently they are prepared to go on subscribing indefinitely times putting commas round apparently amounts to the insertion of a further clause such as though you would not think they could be such fools but what the precise contents of the further clause may be is problematic at any rate a writer should not invite us to read between the lines unless he is sure of two things what he wants to be read there and that we are likely to be willing and able readers of it the same is true of many words that are half adverbs and half conjunctions like therefore we have the right to comma them off if we like but unless it is done with a definite purpose it produces perplexity as well as heaviness in the first of the next two examples there is no need whatever for the commas in the second the motive is clear having the choice between commas and no commas

tom and john knew this and therefore john the soft hearted one kept out of the way trollope it would not be possible to sanction an absolutely unlimited expenditure on the volunteers the burden on the tax payers would be too great he therefore wished that those who knew most about the volunteers would make up their minds as to the direction in which there should be development times after for and and beginning a sentence commas are often used that are hardly even correct it may be suspected that writers allow themselves to be deceived by the false analogy of sentences in which the and or for is immediately followed by a subordinate clause or phrase that has a right to its two commas when there is no such interruption the only possible plea for the comma is that it is not logical but rhetorical and conveys some archness or other special significance such as is hardly to be found in our two examples the lawn the soft smooth slope the bespeak an amount of elegant comfort within that would serve for a palace this indication is not without warrant for within it is a house of refinement and luxury dickens and it is true that these were the days of mental and moral fermentation hutton we shall class here also assuming for the present that the rhetorical plea may be allowed even when there is no logical justification for a stop two sentences in which the copula is standing between subject and complement has commas on each side of it impressiveness is what is aimed at it seems to us a tawdry device for giving one s sentence an ex cathedra air the reason why the world lacks unity is because man is disunited with himself emerson the charm in nelson s history is the unselfish greatness emerson many other kinds of over stopping might be illustrated but we have intentionally confined ourselves here to specimens in which grammatical considerations do not arise and the sentence is equally correct whether the stops are inserted or not sentences in which over stopping outrages grammar more or less decidedly will be incidentally treated later on meanwhile we make the general remark that ungrammatical insertion of stops is a high crime and misdemeanour whereas ungrammatical omission of them is often venial and in some cases even desirable nevertheless the over stopping that offends against nothing but taste has its counterpart in under stopping of the same sort and it must be added that nothing so easily exposes a writer to the suspicion of being uneducated as omission of commas against nearly universal custom in the examples that follow every one will see at the first glance where commas are wanting when it is remembered that as we have implied an author has the right to select the degree of intensity or scale of his punctuation it can hardly be said that grammar actually demands any stops in these sentences taken by themselves yet the effect unless we choose to assume misprints as we naturally do in isolated cases is horrible it may be asked can further depreciation be afforded times i believe you used to live in warwickshire at willowsmere court did you not corelli the hills slope gently to the cliffs which overhang the bay

you flatter me geoffrey corelli i like your swiftness of action geoffrey corelli good heavens man there are no end of lords and ladies who will corelli although we are when we turn from taste to grammar on slightly firmer ground it will be seen that there are many debatable questions and we shall have to use some technical terms as usual only those points will be attended to which our observation has shown to be important the substantival clause subordinate clauses are sentences containing a subject and predicate but serving the purpose in the main sentence to which they are sometimes joined by a subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun but sometimes without any separate and visible link of single words namely of noun adjective or adverb they are called respectively substantival adjectival or adverbial clauses examples substantival he asked what i should do my plan noun adjectival the man who acts honestly is respected honest adjective adverbial i shall see you when the sun next rises to morrow adverb now there is no rule that subordinate clauses must be separated from the main sentence by a stop that depends on whether they are essential parts of the proposition when stops are generally wrong or more or less separable accidents when commas are more or less required but what we wish to draw attention to is a distinction in this respect very generally disregarded between the substantival clause and the two other kinds when the others are omitted though the desired meaning may be spoilt the grammar generally remains uninjured a complete though not perhaps valuable sentence is left the man is respected i shall see you are as much sentences alone as they were with the adjectival and adverbial clauses with substantival clauses this is seldom true they are usually the subjects objects or complements of the verbs that is are grammatically essential he asked is meaningless by itself even if the point is that he asked and did not answer things or something has to be supplied in thought now it is a principle not without exceptions but generally sound that the subject object or complement is not to be separated from its verb even by a comma though two commas belonging to an inserted parenthetic clause or phrase or word may intervene it follows that there is no logical or grammatical justification though there may be a rhetorical one for the comma so frequently placed before the that of an indirect statement our own opinion which is however contrary to the practice of most compositors is that this should always be omitted except when the writer has a very distinct reason for producing rhetorical impressiveness by an unusual pause some very ugly overstopping would thus be avoided yet there too we find that character has its problems to solve meredith we know that in the individual man consciousness grows huxley and it is said that on a visitor once asking to see his library descartes led him huxley the general opinion however was that if bute had been early practised in debate he might have become an impressive speaker macaulay the comma before whether in the next is actually misleading we are tempted to take as adverbial what is really a substantival clause object to the verbal noun indifference the book had merits due to the author s indifference whether he showed bad taste or not provided he got nearer to the impression he wished to convey speaker grammar however would afford some justification for distinguishing between the substantival clause as subject object or complement and the substantival clause in apposition with one of these though there should decidedly be no comma in he said that it is strictly defensible in it is said that the that clause in the latter is explanatory of and in apposition with it and the ordinary sign of apposition is a comma similarly my opinion is that it is my opinion that but as there seems to be no value whatever in the distinction our advice is to do without the comma in all ordinary cases of either kind a useful and reasonable exception is made in some manuals for instance in bigelow s manual of punctuation we read clauses like it is said introducing several propositions or quotations each preceded by the word that should have a comma before the first that but if a single proposition or quotation only is given no comma is necessary example philosophers assert that nature is unlimited in her operations that she has inexhaustible treasures in reserve that anything that shows the reader what he is to expect and so saves him the trouble of coming back to revise his first impressions is desirable if there is no strong reason against it a more important distinction is this he said c may have for its object and it is said c for its virtual subject either the actual words said or a slight rearrangement of them not necessarily to the eye but at least to the mind which makes them more clearly part of the grammatical construction and turns them into true subordinate clauses thus he told her you are in danger may be kept but is usually altered to he told her that she was in danger or to he told her she was in danger in the first you are in danger is not properly a subordinate clause but a sentence which may be said to be in apposition with these words understood in the second and third alike the altered words are a subordinate substantival clause the object to told it follows that when the actual words are given as such this is sometimes only to be known by the tone compare i tell you i will come and i tell you i will come a comma should be inserted whereas when they are meant as mere reported or indirect speech it should be omitted actual words given as such should also be begun with a capital letter and if they consist of a compound sentence or of several sentences a comma will not suffice for their introduction a colon a colon and dash or a full stop with quotation marks always in the last case and usually in the others will be necessary but these are distinctions that need not be considered here in detail further it must be remembered that substantival clauses include indirect questions as well as indirect statements and that the same rules will apply to them the two following examples are very badly stopped a add to all this that he died in his thirty seventh year and then ask if it be strange that his poems are imperfect carlyle accommodation of the stops to the words would give and then ask if it be strange that his poems are imperfect and accommodation of the words

asked can further depreciation be afforded it may be asked whether further depreciation can be afforded as the sentences stood originally we get in the carlyle a most theatrical and in the times a most slovenly effect the verb and its subject object or complement our argument against the common practice of placing a comma before substantival that clauses and others like them was in brief this sort of that clause is simply equivalent to a noun that noun is with few exceptions the subject object or complement to a verb and between things so closely and essentially connected as the verb and any of these no stop should intervene unless for very strong and special rhetorical reasons this last principle that the verb and its essential belongings must not be parted was merely assumed we think it will be granted by any one who reads the next two examples it is felt at once that a writer who will break the principle with so little excuse as here will shrink from nothing so poor byron

resisted in the three that come next the considerable length of the subject it must be admitted makes a comma comforting it gives us a sort of assurance that we have kept our hold on the sentence it is illogical however and owing to the importance of not dividing subject from verb unpleasantly illogical in each case the comfort would be equally effective if it were legitimized by the insertion of a comma before as well as after the clause or phrase at the end of which the present comma stands the extra commas would be after earth victims schleiden to see so many thousand wretches burdening the

proposed to do for a stop that we mean really to do something different from its ostensible work but the answer is that with few tools and many tasks to do much fudging is in fact necessary a special form of this in protest against which we shall give five examples each from a different well known author is when the subject includes and ends with a defining relative clause after which an illogical comma is placed as the relative clause is of the defining kind a phrase that has been explained it is practically impossible to fudge in these sentences by putting a comma before the relative pronoun even in the first sentence the length of the relative clause is no sufficient excuse and in all the others we should abolish the comma without hesitation the same quickness of sympathy which had

object groups from its verb drew every one will allow that the sentences are clumsy most people will allow that the commas are illogical as for us we do not say that if the words are to be kept as they are the commas should be omitted but we do say that a good writer when he found himself reduced to illogical commas should have taken the trouble to rearrange his words de maistre was never more clear sighted than when he made a vigorous and deliberate onslaught upon bacon the centre of his movement against revolutionary principles morley in saying that the encyclopaedists began a political work what is meant is that they drew into the light of new ideas groups of institutions usages and arrangements which affected the well being of france as closely as nutrition affected the health and strength of an individual frenchman morley it may be added by way of concluding this section that the insertion of a comma in the middle of an absolute construction which is capable as was shown in the sentence about colonel hutchinson and the governor of having very bad results indeed is only a particular instance and reductio ad absurdum of inserting a comma between subject and verb the comma in the absolute construction is so recognized a trap that it might have been thought needless to mention it the following instances however will show that a warning is even now necessary sir e seymour

strictly speaking does the work of an adjective in the sentence it usually begins with a relative pronoun but sometimes with a relative adverb the man who does not breathe dies is equivalent to the unbreathing man dies the place where we stand is holy ground is equivalent to this place is holy ground but we shall include under the phrase all clauses that begin with a relative though some relative clauses are not adjectival because a division of all into defining clauses on the one hand and non defining or commenting on the other is more easily intelligible than the division into adjectival and non adjectival this distinction is more fully gone into in the chapter on syntax where it is suggested that that when possible is the appropriate relative for defining and which for non defining clauses that however is a debatable point and quite apart from the question of stopping that arises here examples of the two types are defining the river that which runs through london is turbid commenting the thames which runs through london is turbid it will be seen that in the first the relative clause is an answer to the imaginary question which river that is it defines the noun to which it belongs in the second such a question as which thames is hardly conceivable the relative clause gives us a piece of extra and non essential information an independent comment the two types are not always so easily distinguished as in these examples constructed for the purpose what we wish here to say is that it would contribute much to clearness of style if writers would always make up their minds whether they intend a definition or a comment and would invariably use no commas with a defining clause and two commas with a non defining all the examples that follow are in our opinion wrong the first three are of defining relative clauses wrongly preceded by commas the second three of commenting relative clauses wrongly not preceded by commas the last of all there may be a doubt about if the long clause beginning with which is intended merely to show how great the weariness is and which is practically equivalent to so great that it may be called a defining clause and the omission of the comma is right but if the which really acts as a mere connexion to introduce a new fact that the correspondent wishes to record the clause is non defining and the comma ought according to our rule to be inserted before it the man who thinketh in his heart and hath the power straightway very straightway to go and do it is not so common in any country crockett now everyone must do

signs of weariness which even the reported appearance of admiral nebogatoff in the malacca strait is unable to remove times the adverb adverbial phrase and adverbial clause in writing of substantival and adjectival clauses our appeal was for more logical precision than is usual we said that the comma habitual before substantival clauses was in most cases unjustifiable and should be omitted even at the cost of occasional slight discomfort we said that with one division of adjectival or rather relative clauses commas should always be used and with another they should always be omitted with the adverbial clauses phrases and words on the other hand our appeal is on the whole for less precision we recommend that less precision should be aimed at at least though more attained than at present certain kinds of laxity here are not merely venial but laudable certain other kinds are damning evidence of carelessness or bad taste or bad education it is not here a mere matter of choosing between one right and one wrong way there are many degrees now is an adverb in the house is usually an adverbial phrase if i know it is an adverbial clause logic and grammar never prohibit the separating of any such expressions from the rest of their sentence by two commas if they stand in the middle of it by one if they begin or end it but use of the commas tends especially with a single word but also with a phrase or clause though in inverse proportion to its length to modify the meaning i can not do it now means no more than it says i can not do it now conveys a further assurance that the speaker would have been delighted to do it yesterday or will be quite willing tomorrow this distinction generally recognized with the single word applies also to clauses and writers of judgement should take the fullest freedom in such matters allowing no superstition about subordinate clauses to force upon them commas that they feel to be needless but inclining always when in doubt to spare readers the jerkiness of overstopping it is a question for rhetoric alone not for logic so long as the proper allowance of commas if any is given what the proper allowance is has been explained a few lines back we need not waste time on exemplifying this simple principle there is so far no real laxity the writer is simply free laxity comes in when we choose guided by nothing more authoritative than euphony to stop an adverbial phrase or adverbial clause but not to stop it at both ends though it stands in the middle of its sentence this is an unmistakable offence against logic and lays one open to the condemnation of examiners and precisians but the point we wish to make is that in a very large class of sentences the injury to meaning is so infinitesimal and the benefit to sound so considerable that we do well to offend the class is so large that only one example need be given but with their triumph over the revolt cranmer and his colleagues advanced yet more boldly j r green the adverbial phrase is with their triumph over the revolt but does not belong to it but to the whole sentence the writer has no defence whatever as against the logician nevertheless his reader will be grateful to him the familiar intrusion of a comma after initial and and for where there is no intervening clause to justify it of which we gave examples when we spoke of overstopping comes probably by false analogy from the unpleasant pause that rigid punctuation has made common in sentences of this type laxity once introduced however has to be carefully kept within bounds it may be first laid down absolutely that when an adverbial clause is to be stopped but incompletely stopped the omitted stop must always be the one at the beginning and never the one at the end transgression of this is quite intolerable we shall give several instances at the end of the section to impress the fact but it is also true that even the omission of the beginning comma looks more and more slovenly the further we get from the type of our above cited sentence the quotations immediately following are arranged from the less to the more slovenly his health gave way and at the age of fifty six he died prematurely

being natural at first to suppose that we are to supply was again this can only happen when we are in the middle of a sentence and not at the beginning as in the pattern cranmer sentence the gross negligence or ignorance betrayed by giving the first and omitting the second comma will be convincingly shown by this array of sentences from authors of all degrees it is not strange that the

everything that is adverbial is parenthetic it can be inserted or removed that is without damaging the grammar though not always without damaging the meaning of the sentence but the adverbial parenthesis when once inserted forms a part of the sentence we have sufficiently dealt with the stops it requires in the last section the use of commas emphasizes its parenthetic character and is therefore sometimes desirable sometimes not no more need be said about it another kind of parenthesis is that whose meaning practically governs the sentence in the middle of which it is nevertheless inserted as an alien element that does not coalesce in grammar with the rest the type is but you will say caesar is not an aristocrat this kind is important for our purpose because of the muddles often made chiefly by careless punctuation between the real parenthesis and words that give the same meaning but are not like it grammatically separable we shall start with an indisputable example of this muddle where do you imagine she would lay it meredith these commas can not possibly indicate anything but parenthesis but if the comma d words were really a parenthesis we ought to have would she instead of she would the four sentences that now follow are all of one pattern the bad stopping is probably due to this same confusion between the parenthetic and the non parenthetic but it is possible that in each the two commas are independent the first being one of those that are half rhetorical and half caused by false analogy which have been mentioned as common after initial and and for and the second being the comma wrongly used as we have maintained before substantival that clauses whence it would appear that he considers that all deliverances of consciousness are original

word off its true place all true science begins with empiricism though all true science is such exactly in so far as it strives to pass out of the empirical stage huxley exactly qualifies and belongs to in so far c not such the comma should be before it this they for the most part throw away as worthless corelli for the most part alone is the adverbial parenthesis but this fault occurs perhaps nine times out of ten in combination with the that clause comma so often mentioned it may be said when our instances have been looked into that in each of them apart from the that clause comma which is recognized by many authorities there is merely the licence that we have ourselves allowed omission of the first without omission of the last comma of an adverbial parenthesis but we must point out that huxley green and mr balfour man of science historian and philosopher all belong to that dignified class of writers which is supposed to and in most respects does insist on full logical stopping

this name liberally interpreted is meant to include several more or less distinct questions they are difficult and much debated by authorities on punctuation but are of no great importance we shall take the liberty of partly leaving them undecided and partly giving arbitrary opinions to argue them out would take more space than it is worth while to give but it is worth while to draw attention to them so that each writer may be aware that they exist and at least be consistent with himself typical sentences from beadnell are a industry honesty and temperance are essential to happiness b b let

france b common variants for a are industry honesty and temperance are essential industry honesty and temperance are essential industry honesty and temperance are essential we unhesitatingly recommend the original and fully stopped form which should be used irrespective of style and not be interfered with by rhetorical considerations it is the only one to which there is never any objection of the examples that follow the first conforms to the correct type but no serious harm would be done if it did not the second also conforms and if this had followed variant or here indistinguishable we should have been in danger of supposing that education and police were one department instead of two the third having no comma after interests follows variant and as it happens with no bad effect on the meaning all three variants however may under different conditions produce ambiguity or worse but those that remain the women the youths the children and the elders work all the harder times japanese advisers are now attached to the departments of the household war finance education and police times an american whose patience tact and ability in reconciling conflicting interests have won the praise of all nationalities times sometimes enumerations are arranged in pairs it is then most unpleasant to have the comma after the last pair omitted as in the orange and the lemon the olive and the walnut elbow each other for a footing in the fat dark earth f m crawford there is a bastard form of enumeration against which warning is seriously needed it is viewed as but is not really a legitimate case of type a and a quite unnecessary objection to the repetition of and no doubt supplies the motive examples are he kept man uvring upon neipperg who counter man uvred with vigilance good judgment and would not come to action carlyle moltke had recruited trained and knew by heart all the men under him times hence loss of time of money and sore trial of patience r g white the principle is this in an enumeration given by means of a comma or commas the last comma being replaced by or combined with and our type a that is there must not be anything that is common to two members as here counter man uvred with had loss without being common to all we may say moltke had recruited and trained and knew moltke had recruited had trained and knew or moltke had recruited trained and known but we must not say what the times says the third sentence may run loss of time and money and sore trial or loss of time of money and of patience but not as it does so much for type a type b can be very shortly disposed of it differs in that the conjunction and or nor c is expressed every time instead of being represented except in the last place by a comma it is logically quite unnecessary but rhetorically quite allowable to use commas as well as conjunctions the only caution needed is that if commas are used at all and if the enumeration does not end the sentence and is not concluded by a stronger stop a comma must be inserted after the last member as well as after the others in the type sentence which contains two enumerations it would be legitimate to use commas as well as and s with one set and not with the other if it were desired either to avoid monotony or to give one list special emphasis the three examples now to be added transgress the rule about the final comma we arrange them from bad to worse in the last of them the apparently needless though not necessarily wrong comma after fall suggests that the writer has really felt a comma to be wanting to the enumeration but has taken a bad shot with it as in the examples of section on the misplaced comma neither the court nor society nor parliament nor the older men in the army have yet recognized the fundamental truth that times a subordinate whose past conduct in the post he fills and whose known political sympathies make him wholly unfitted however loyal his intentions may be to give that times but there are uninstructed ears on whom the constant abuse and imputation of low motives may fall with a mischievous and misleading effect times of type c the characteristic is that we have two or more adjectives attached to a following noun are there to be commas between the adjectives or not the rule usually given is that there should be unless the last adjective is more intimately connected with the noun so that the earlier one qualifies not the noun but the last adjective and the noun together it will be noticed that we strictly have no enumeration then at all this is sometimes useful and so is the more practical and less theoretic direction to ask whether and could be inserted and if so use the comma but not otherwise these both sound sufficient in the abstract but that there are doubts left in practice is shown by the type sentence which beadnell gives as correct though either test would rather require the comma he gives also as correct can flattery soothe the dull cold ear of death which is not very clearly distinguishable from the other our advice is to use these tests when in doubt but with a leaning to the omission of the comma if it happens that a comma of this particular class is the only stop in a sentence it has a false appearance of dividing the sentence into two parts that is very unpleasant and may make the reader go through it twice to make sure that all is right an inconvenience that should by all means be spared him type d is one in which the final word or phrase of a sentence has two previous expressions standing in the same grammatical relation to it but their ending with different prepositions or the fact that one is to be substituted for the other or the length of the expressions or some other cause obscures this identity of relation add to the type sentence the following his eloquence was the main one might almost say the sole source of his influence bryce to dazzle people more he learned or pretended to learn the spanish language bagehot apart from philosophical and sometimes from theological theories balfour the rules we lay down are if possible use no stops at all never use the second comma and omit the first even when the first is necessary the second may often be dispensed with both commas may be necessary if the phrases are long we should correct all the examples including the type the type under rule the bryce which is strictly correct under rule the bagehot under rules and and the balfour under rules and the list two are clearly wrong the four would then stand as follows many states are in alliance with and under the protection of france his eloquence was the main one might almost say the sole source of his influence to dazzle people more he learned or pretended to learn the spanish language apart from philosophical and sometimes from theological theories learners will be inclined to say all this is very indefinite do give us a clear rule that will apply to all cases such was the view with which on a matter of even greater importance than punctuation procrustes identified himself but it brought him to a bad end the clear rule use all logical commas would give us he was born in or near london on december th no one would write this who was not suffering from bad hypertrophy of the grammatical conscience the clear rule use no commas in this sort of enumeration would give if i have the queer ways you accuse me of that is because but i should have thought a man of your perspicacity might have been expected to see that it was also why i live in a hermitage all by myself no one would write this without both commas after because and why who was not deeply committed to an anti comma crusade between the two extremes lie cases calling for various treatment the ruling principle should be freedom within certain limits the comma between independent sentences among the signs that more particularly betray the uneducated writer is inability to see when a comma is not a sufficient stop unfortunately little more can be done than to warn beginners that any serious slip here is much worse than they will probably suppose and recommend them to observe the practice of good writers it is roughly true that grammatically independent sentences should be parted by at least a semicolon but in the first place there are very large exceptions to this and secondly the writer who really knows a grammatically independent sentence when he sees it is hardly in need of instruction this must be our excuse for entering here into what may be thought too elementary an explanation let us take the second point first it may be of some assistance to remark that a sentence joined to the previous one by a coordinating conjunction is grammatically independent as well as one not joined to it at all but the difference between a coordinating and a subordinating conjunction is itself in english rather fine every one can see that i will not try it is dangerous is two independent sentences independent in grammar though not in thought but it is a harder saying that i will not try for it is dangerous is also two sentences while i will not try because it is dangerous is one only the reason is that for coordinates and because subordinates instead of giving lists which would probably be incomplete of the two kinds of conjunction we mention that a subordinating conjunction may be known from the other kind by its being possible to place it and its clause before the previous sentence instead of after without destroying the sense we can say because it is dangerous i will not try but not for it is dangerous i will not try this test can not always be applied in complicated sentences simple ones must be constructed for testing the conjunction in question assuming that it is now understood what a subordinating and what a coordinating conjunction is that a member joined on by no more than a coordinating conjunction is a grammatically independent sentence or simply a sentence in the proper meaning of the word and not a subordinate clause we return to the first point this was that though independent sentences are regularly parted by at least a semicolon there are large exceptions to the rule these we shall only be able to indicate very loosely there are three conditions that may favour the reduction of the semicolon to a comma those coordinating conjunctions which are most common tend in the order of their commonness to be humble and to recognize a comma as sufficient for their dignity the order may perhaps be given as and or but so nor for conjunctions less common than these should scarcely ever be used with less than a semicolon and many good writers would refuse to put a mere comma before for shortness and lightness of the sentence joined on helps to lessen the need for a heavy stop intimate connexion in thought with the preceding sentence has the same effect before giving our examples which are all of undesirable commas we point out that in the first two there are independent signs of the writers being uneducated and such signs will often be discoverable it will be clear from what we have said why the others are bad except perhaps the third it is particularly disagreeable to have two successive independent sentences tagged on with commas as those beginning with nor and for are in that example no peace at night he enjoys for he lays awake guernsey advertiser now accepted nominal christendom believes this and strives to attain unto it then why the inconsistency of creed and deed daily telegraph but who is responsible to government for the efficiency of the army the commander in chief and no one else nor has anyone questioned the fact for it is patent times but even on this theory the formula above stated holds good for such systems so far from being self contained as it were and sufficient evidence for themselves are really balfour some banks on the nevsky prospect are having iron shutters fitted otherwise there is nothing apparently to justify general trepoff s proclamation times everybody knows where his own shoe pinches and if people find drawbacks in the places they inhabit they must also find advantages otherwise they would not be there times we have suffered many things at the hands of the russian navy during the war nevertheless the news that admiral rozhdestvensky will send a thrill of admiration times i think that on the whole we may be thankful for the architectural merits of the gaiety block it has breadth and dignity of design and groups well on the angular site times it will not be irrelevant to add here though the point has been touched upon in understopping that though a light and clause may be introduced by no more than a comma it does not follow that it need not be separated by any stop at all as in when the motor cars act was before the house it was suggested that these authorities should be given the right to make recommendations to the central authorities and that right was conceded times the semicolon between subordinate members just as the tiro will be safer if he avoids commas before independent sentences so he will generally be wise not to use a semicolon before a mere subordinate member we have explained indeed that it is sometimes quite legitimate for rhetorical reasons and is under certain circumstances almost required by proportion this is when the sentence contains commas doing less important work than the one about which the question arises but the tiro s true way out of the difficulty is to simplify his sentences so that they do not need such differentiation even skilful writers as the following two quotations will show sometimes come to grief over this one view called me to another one hill to its fellow half

the semicolon clearly ought to change places in the second it looks as if carlyle had thought it dull to have so many commas about but the remedy was much worse than dullness avoidance of what a correspondent supposes to be dull but what would in fact be natural and right accounts also for the following piece of vicarious rhetoric the writer is not nearly so excited it may be suspected as his semicolons would make him out the ordinary sensible man would have used commas and either omitted the third and fourth denies reminding us of zola s famous j accuse not vicarious and on an adequate occasion or else inserted an and before the last repetition mr loomis denies all three categorically he denies that the asphalt company paid him or any other sum denies that he purchased a claim against the venezuelan government and then used his influence when minister at caracas to collect the claim denies that he agreed with mr meyers or anybody else to use his influence for money times the exclamation mark when there is no exclamation my friend this conduct amazes me b we must differ altogether from beadnell s rule that this point is used to denote any sudden emotion of the mind whether of joy grief surprise fear or any other sensation at least as it is exemplified in his first instance given above the exclamation mark after friend is justifiable not the other the stop should be used with one exception only after real exclamations real exclamations include the words recognized as interjections as alas fragmentary expressions that are not complete sentences as my friend in the example and complete statements that contain an exclamatory word as what a piece of work is man b the exception mentioned above is this when the writer wishes to express his own incredulity or other feeling about what is not his own statement but practically a quotation from some one else he is at liberty to do it with a mark of exclamation in the following example the epitaph writer expresses either his wonder or his incredulity about what fame says entomb d within this vault a lawyer lies who fame assureth us was just and wise b the exclamation mark is a neat and concise sneer at the legal profession outside these narrow limits the exclamation mark must not be used we shall quote a very instructive saying of landor s i read warily and whenever i find the writings of a lady the first thing i do is to cast my eye along her pages to see whether i am likely to be annoyed by the traps and spring guns of interjections and if i happen to espy them i do not leap the paling to this we add that when the exclamation mark is used after mere statements it deserves the name by which it is sometimes called mark of admiration we feel that the writer is indeed lost in admiration of his own wit or impressiveness but this use is mainly confined to lower class authors when a grave historian stoops to it he gives us quite a different sort of shock from what he designed the unfortunate commander was in the situation of some bold high mettled cavalier rushing to battle on a warhorse whose tottering joints threaten to give way at every step and leave his rider to the mercy of his enemies prescott the road now struck into the heart of a mountain region where woods precipices and ravines were mingled together in a sort of chaotic confusion with here and there a green and

would who could exist without it save me corelli what wonder that the most docile of russians should be crying out how long times we have started with three indisputable instances of the exclamation mark used for the question mark it is worth notice that the correct stopping for the end of the second quotation though such accuracy is seldom attempted would be long to have fused two questions into an exclamation is an achievement but these are mere indefensible blunders not needing to be thought twice about such as author and compositor incline to put off each on the other s shoulders the case is not always so clear in the six sentences lettered for reference a d have the wrong stop in e the stop implied by he exclaims is also wrong in f though the stop is right assuming that the form of the sentence is what was really meant we venture to question this point as we do also in some of the earlier sentences any one who agrees with the details of this summary can save himself the trouble of reading the subsequent discussion a in that interval what had i not lost lamb b and what will not the discontinuance cost me richardson c a streak of blue below the hanging alders is certainly a characteristic introduction to the kingfisher how many people first see him so times d does the reading of history make us fatalists what courage does not the opposite opinion show emerson e what economy of life and money he exclaims would not have been spared the empire of the tsars had it not rendered war certain by devoting itself so largely to the works of peace times f how many who think no otherwise than the young painter have we not heard disbursing secondhand hyperboles stevenson it will be noticed that in all these sentences except c there is a negative which puts them except f wrong while in c it is the absence of the negative that makes the question wrong it will be simplest to start with c the writer clearly means to let us know that many people see the kingfisher first as a blue streak he might give this simply so as a statement he might artificially give it as an exclamation how many first see him so or he might very artificially give it as a question how many do not first see him so a rhetorical question in which how many interrogative is understood to be equivalent to few positive he has rejected the simple statement vaulting ambition has o erleapt and he has ended in a confusion between the two artificial ways of saying the thing taking the words of the possible exclamation and the stop of the possible question in a b d and implicitly in e we have the converse arrangement or derangement but as a little more clear thinking is required for them we point out that the origin of the confusion though the careless printing of fifty or a hundred years ago no doubt helped to establish it lies in the identity between the words used for questions and for exclamations it will be enough to suggest the process that accounts for a the ambiguity is easily got rid of by inserting a noun with what question what amount had i lost exclamation what an amount i had lost that is the first stage the resemblance is next increased by inverting subject and verb in the exclamation which is both natural enough in that kind of sentence and particularly easy after in that interval so we get question in that interval what amount had i lost exclamation in that interval what an amount had i lost the words when the bracketed part of each sentence is left out are now the same but the question is of course incapable of giving the required meaning the writer seeing this but deceived by the order of words into thinking the exclamation a question tries to mend it by inserting not what not in rhetorical questions being equivalent to everything at this stage some writers stick as stevenson in f others try to make a right out of two wrongs by restoring to the quondam exclamation which has been wrongly converted with the help of not into a question the exclamation mark to which it has after conversion no right such is the genesis of a b d the proper method when the simple statement is rejected as it often reasonably may be is to use the exclamation not the stevensonian question to give the exclamation its right mark and not to insert the illogical negative internal question and exclamation marks by this name we do not mean that insertion of a bracketed stop of which we shall nevertheless give one example that is indeed a confession of weakness and infallible sign of the prentice hand and further examples will be found in airs and graces miscellaneous but it is outside grammar with which these sections are concerned under these circumstances it would be interesting to ascertain the exact position of landlords whose tenants decline to pay rent and whose only asset from their property is the income tax now claimed times what is meant is the ugly stop in the middle of a sentence unbracketed and undefended by quotation marks of which examples follow to novelists as in the first example it may be necessary for the purpose of avoiding the nuisance of perpetual quotation marks but elsewhere it should be got rid of by use of the indirect question or otherwise excessive indulgence in direct questions or exclamations where there is no need for them whatever is one of the sensational tendencies of modern newspapers why be scheming victor asked meredith what will japan do is thought the most pressing question of all times what japan will do is thought c what next is the next question which the american press discusses

principal part and seeing it with lively interest was it distinctly dates for nothing wears so badly as the namby pamby times the unaccountable comma we shall now conclude these grammatical sections with a single example of those commas about which it is only possible to say that they are repugnant to grammar it is as difficult to decide what principle they offend against as what impulse can possibly have dictated them they are commonest in the least educated writers of all and next to these in the men of science whose overpowering conscientiousness has made the mechanical putting in of commas so habitual that it perhaps becomes with them a sort of reflex action and does itself at wrong moments without their volition the rector lineal representative of the ancient monarchs of the university though now little more than a king of shreds and patches huxley the colon it was said in the general remarks at the beginning of this chapter that the systematic use of the colon as one of the series had died out with the decay of formal periods many people continue to use it but few if we can trust our observation with any nice regard to its value some think it a prettier or more impressive stop than the semicolon and use it instead of that some like variety and use the two indifferently or resort to one when they are tired of the other as the abandonment of periodic arrangement really makes the colon useless it would be well though of course any one who still writes in formal periods should retain his rights over it if ordinary writers would give it up altogether except in the special uses independent of its quantitative value to which it is being more and more applied by common consent these are between two sentences that are in clear antithesis but not connected by an adversative conjunction introducing a short quotation introducing a list introducing a sentence that comes as fulfilment of a promise expressed or implied in the previous sentence

of which therefore and however are instances occupy usually the second place in the sentence when there it is of little importance whether they are stopped or not though we have indicated our preference for no stops but when it happens that they come later or earlier the commas are generally wanted therefore in the first of these sentences would be as uncomfortable if stripped as however actually is in the second dashes moved beyond his wont by our english ill treatment of the dash beadnell permits himself a wail as just as it is pathetic the dash is frequently employed in a very capricious and arbitrary manner as a substitute for all sorts of points by writers whose thoughts although it may be sometimes striking and profound are thrown together without order or dependence also by some others who think that they thereby give prominence and emphasis to expressions which in themselves are very commonplace and would without this fictitious assistance escape the observation of the reader or be deemed by him hardly worthy of notice it is all only too true these are the realms of chaos and the lord of them is sterne from whom modern writers of the purely literary kind have

read if any such reading as this could be supposed to hold out so long to the very end of the world sterne the modern newspaper writer who overdoes the use of dashes is seldom as incorrect as sterne but is perhaps more irritating there are also a great number of people many of them not in the least tainted by militarism who go further and who feel that a man in order to be a complete man that is one capable of protecting his life his country and his civil and political rights should acquire as a boy and youth the elements of military training that is should be given a physical training of a military character including spectator it must be added however that beadnell himself helps to make things worse by countenancing the strange printer s superstition that is beautiful to look upon and ugly under these circumstances we shall have to abandon our usual practice of attending only to common mistakes and deal with the matter a little more systematically we shall first catalogue with examples the chief uses of the dash next state the debatable questions that arise and end with the more definite misuses it will be convenient to number all examples for reference and as many or most of the quotations contain some minor violation of what we consider the true principles these will be corrected in brackets chief common uses a adding to a phrase already used an explanation example or

parenthesis and the heavy bracket parenthesis it also has the advantage over brackets that when the parenthesis ends only with the sentence the second dash need not be given this advantage however may involve ambiguity as will be shown in every well regulated community such as that of england the laws own no superior b the comma should either be omitted or placed after instead of before the second dash these are a dozen distinct uses of more or less value or importance to which others might no doubt be added but they will suffice both to show that the dash is a hard worked symbol and to base our remarks upon debatable questions there are several questions that must be answered before we can use the dash with confidence first is the dash to supersede stops at the place where it is inserted or to be added to them secondly what is its relation to the stops in the part of the sentence or group of sentences that follows it does its authority that is extend to the end of the sentence or group or where does it cease thirdly assuming that it is or can be combined with stops what is the right order as between the two beadnell s answer to the first question is the dash does not dispense with the use of the ordinary points at the same time when the grammatical construction of the sentence requires them but inasmuch as a dash implies some sort of break irregular pause or change of intention it seems quite needless to insert the stop that would have been used if it had not been decided that a stop was inadequate the dash is a confession that the stop will not do then let the stop go the reader who is the person to be considered generally neither knows nor cares to know how the sentence might with inferior effect have been written he only feels that the stop is otiose and that his author had better have been off with the old love before he was on with the new there are exceptions to this obviously in examples and where the dash is at the end or beginning of a sentence and perhaps also in sentences of which the reader can clearly foresee the grammatical development in example for instance it is clear that a participle displayed or another is due after never was c a comma after intelligence is therefore definitely expected so in example we are expecting either another continuation of as soon as or the principal sentence before either of which a comma is looked for in examples and on the other hand the sentence may for all we know be complete at the place where the dash stands so that no expectation is disappointed by omitting the comma the rule then should be that a dash is a substitute for any internal stop and not an addition to it except when from the reader s point of view a particular stop seemed inevitable it must be admitted that that conclusion is not very certain and also that the matter is of no great importance provided that the stops if inserted are the right ones more certainty is possible about the combination of stops with the double dash which we have not yet considered the probable origin of the double dash will be touched upon when we come to the second question but whatever its origin it is now simply equivalent to a pair of brackets except that it is slightly less conspicuous and sometimes preferred on that account consequently the same rule about stops will apply to both and as there is no occasion to treat of brackets separately it may here be stated for both the use of a parenthesis being to insert without damage to the rest of the sentence something that is of theoretically minor importance it is necessary that we should be able simply to remove the two dashes or brackets with everything enclosed by them and after their removal find the sentence complete and rightly punctuated further there is no reason for using inside the parenthesis any stop that has not an internal value that is no stop can possibly be needed just before the second dash except an exclamation or question mark and none at all just after the first but stops may be necessary to divide up the parenthesis itself if it is compound three examples follow with the proper corrections in brackets garinet cites the case of a girl near amiens possessed by three demons mimi zozo and crapoulet in lowell omit both commas the first is indeed just possible though not required in the principal sentence the last is absolutely meaningless in the parenthesis its visions and its delights are too penetrating too living for any white washed object or shallow fountain long to endure or to supply ruskin omit both commas this time the first is as impossible in the principal sentence as the second is meaningless in the parenthesis the second carries us on from to less than a century yet the walls of the big hall in the examination schools are not only well covered times insert a comma as necessary to the principal sentence outside the dashes whether before the first or after the last will be explained in our answer to the third question the second question is how far the authority of the dash extends there is no reason in the nature of things why we should not on the one hand be relieved of it by the next stop or on the other be subject to it till the paragraph ends the three following examples which we shall correct in brackets by anticipation but which we shall also assume not to be mere careless blunders seem to go on the first hypothesis the moral nature that law of laws whose revelations introduce greatness yea god himself into the open soul is not explored emerson substitute a dash for the comma after himself here however emerson expects us to terminate the authority at the right comma rather than at the first that comes making things worse i there complained of the common notions of the special virtues justice c as too vague to furnish exact determinations of the actions enjoined under them h sidgwick substitute a dash for the comma after c there are vicars and vicars and of all sorts i love an innovating vicar a piebald progressive professional reactionary the least h g wells substitute a dash for the comma after reactionary it needs no further demonstration however that commas are frequently used after a dash without putting an end to its influence and if they are to be sometimes taken nevertheless as doing so confusion is sure to result unless the author of the next example is blind to the danger that two neighbouring but independent dashes may be mistaken for a parenthetic pair he must have assumed that the authority of a dash is terminated at any rate by a semicolon that if true would obviate the danger it is a forlorn hope however excellent the translation and mr hankin s could not be bettered or however careful the playing and the playing at the stage society performance was meticulously careful times insert a dash between bettered and the semicolon which then need not be more than a comma but that it is not true will probably be admitted on the strength of sentences like there may be differences of opinion on the degrees no one takes white for black most people sometimes take blackish for black but that is not fatal to my argument on the other hand we doubt whether a full stop is ever allowed to stand in the middle of a dash parenthesis as it of course may in a bracket parenthesis the reason for the distinction is clear when we have had a left hand bracket we know for certain that a right hand one is due full stops or no full stops but when we have had a dash we very seldom know for certain that it is one of a pair and the appearance of a full stop would be too severe a trial of our faith it seems natural to suppose that the double dash parenthesis is thus accounted for the construction started with a single dash but as it was often necessary to revert to the main construction the second dash was resorted to as a declaration that the close time or state of siege was over the rule we deduce is all that follows a dash is to be taken as under its influence until either a second dash terminates it or a full stop is reached our answer to the third question has already been given by implication but it may be better to give it again explicitly we first refer to examples in all of which the stop if one is to be used though our view is that in most of these sentences it should not is in the right place and to example in which it is in the wrong place we next add two new examples of wrong order with corrections as usual the rules for stops with brackets are the same as with double dashes throughout the parts which they are intended to make most personally their own the psalms it is always the law which is spoken of with chief joy ruskin remove both commas and use according to taste either none at all or one after the second bracket what is the difference whether land and sea interact and worlds revolve and intermingle without number or end deep yawning under deep and galaxy balancing galaxy throughout absolute space or whether emerson remove both commas and place one after the second dash a protest must next be made against the compositor s superstition embodied in beadnell s words as the dash in this case supplies the place of the parenthesis strictly speaking the grammatical point should follow the last dash but as this would have an unsightly appearance it is always placed before it this unsightliness is either imaginary or at most purely conventional and should be entirely disregarded the rules will be for the single dash since the dash is on any view either a correction of or an addition to the stop that would have been used if dashes had not existed the dash will always stand after the stop for the double dash or brackets there will be one stop or none according to the requirements of the principal sentence only there will never be two stops apart of course from internal ones if there is one it will stand before the first or after the last dash or bracket according as the parenthesis belongs to the following or the preceding part of the principal sentence it may be added that it is extremely rare for the parenthesis to belong to the last part and therefore for the stop to be rightly placed before it in the following example constructed for the occasion it does so belong but for practical purposes the rule might be that if a stop is required it stands after the second dash or bracket when i last saw him a singular fact his nose was pea green common misuses a if two single independent dashes are placed near each other still more if they are in the same sentence the reader naturally takes them for a pair constituting a parenthesis and has to reconsider the sentence when he finds that his first reading gives nonsense we refer back to example but this indiscretion is so common that it is well to add some more the sentences should be read over without the two dashes and what they enclose then there is also miss euphemia long deposed from her office of governess but pensioned and so driven to good works and the manufacture of the most wonderful crazy quilts for which to her credit be it said she shows a remarkable aptitude as i should have supposed crockett the english came mainly from the germans whom rome found hard to conquer in years say impossible to conquer when one remembers the long sequel emerson as for anne well anne was anne never more calm than when others were tempestuous crockett b the first dash is inserted and the second forgotten it will suffice to refer back to examples c brackets and dashes are combined it is a pity from the collector s point of view that carlyle being in the mood did not realize the full possibilities and add a pair of commas closing up the parenthesis in robur et aes triplex how much would i give to have my mother though both my wife and i have of late times lived wholly for her and had much to endure on her account how much would i give to have her back to me carlyle d like the comma the dash is sometimes misplaced by a word or two in the first example the first dash should be one place later and in the second unless we misread the sentence and this is another case of two single dashes the second dash should be two places earlier and itself be replaced by a comma here she is perhaps at her best and in the best sense her most feminine as a woman sympathizing with the sorrows peculiar to women times the girl he had dreamed about the girl with the smile was there near him in his hut crockett e dashes are sometimes used when an ordinary stop would serve quite well in the lowell sentences the reason why a comma is not used is that the members are themselves broken up by commas and therefore demand a heavier stop to divide them from each other this as explained in the early part of the chapter is the place for a semicolon in the corelli sentence it is a question between comma and semicolon either of which would do quite well shakespeare found a language already to

did not keep us waiting long corelli hyphens we return here to our usual practice of disregarding everything not necessary for dealing with common mistakes but some general principles most of which will probably find acceptance will be useful to start from hyphens are regrettable necessities and to be done without when they reasonably may there are three degrees of intimacy between words of which the first and loosest is expressed by their mere juxtaposition as separate words the second by their being hyphened and the third or closest by their being written continuously as one word thus hand workers hand workers handworkers it is good english usage to place a noun or other non adjectival part of speech before a noun printing it as a separate word and to regard it as serving the purpose of an adjective in virtue of its position for instance war expenditure but there are sometimes special objections to its being done thus words in ing may be actual adjectives participles or nouns gerunds used in virtue of their position as adjectives and a visible distinction is needed a walking stick is a stick that walks and the phrase might occur as a metaphorical description of a stiffly behaved person a walking stick or walkingstick is a stick for walking the difference may sometimes be important and consistency may be held to require that all compounds with gerunds should be hyphened or made into single words not only can a single word in ordinary circumstances be thus treated as an adjective but the same is true of a phrase the words of the phrase however must then be hyphened or ambiguity may result thus covent garden covent garden market covent garden market salesmen the prevailing method of giving railway and street names besides its ungainliness is often misleading and contrary to common sense for one difficulty we suggest recurrence to the old fashioned formula with commas and and as in the london chatham and dover on another it is to be observed

it is stated that the train service on the hsin min tun kau pan tse yingkau section of the imperial chinese railway will be restored within a few days times hsinmintun kaupantse and yingkau these

third class carriages are scarce on the dalny port arthur line times the dalny and port arthur line by general principle though port arthur needs no hyphen by itself it does as soon as it stands for an adjective with line the port arthur line also by the times version implies that dalny is more closely connected with port than port with arthur we do indeed most of us know at present that there is no dalny port so called and that there is a port arthur but in the next example who would know that there was a brest litovski but for the sentence that follows a general strike has been declared on the warsaw brest litovski railway the telegraph stations at praga warsaw and brest litovski have been damaged times the warsaw and brest litovski railway by the hyphen between brest and litovski is necessary if we write warsaw brest litovski it is natural to suppose that three places are meant the and solution is accordingly the best at bow street robert marsh greengrocer of great western road

failing that lowell s method seems the best to use no hyphens and keep the second compound separate adverbs that practically form compounds with verbs but stand after and not necessarily next after

throughout april times there is a tendency to write certain familiar combinations irrationally which may be mentioned here though it does not necessarily involve the hyphen with in no wise and at any

audience for whom a book is intended to an educated man it is an annoyance to find his author warning him that something written long ago and quoted every day almost ever since is not an original remark now first struck out on the other hand writers who address the uneducated may find their account in using all the quotation marks they can their readers may be gratified by seeing how well read

well in our tastes and habits yet so as with a difference lamb with a difference ophelia o you must wear your rue with a difference might escape notice as a quotation if attention were not drawn to it a reader fit to appreciate lamb however could scarcely fail to be sufficiently warned by the odd turn of the preceding words a question of some importance to writers who trouble themselves about accuracy though no doubt the average reader is profoundly indifferent is that of the right order as between quotation marks and stops besides the conflict in which we shall again find ourselves with the aesthetic compositor it is really difficult to arrive at a completely logical system before laying down what seems the best attainable we must warn the reader that it is not the system now in fashion but there are signs that printers are feeling their way towards better things and this is an attempt to anticipate what they will ultimately come to we shall make one or two postulates deduce rules and give examples after the examples in order that readers who are content either to go on with the present compromise or to accept our rules may be able to skip the discussion we shall consider some possible objections no stop is ever required at the end of a quotation to separate the quotation as such from what follows that is sufficiently done by the quotation mark a stop is required to separate the containing sentence which may go on beyond the quotation s end but more commonly does not from what follows an exclamation or question mark which are not true stops but tone symbols may be an essential part of the quotation when a quotation is broken by such insertions as he said any stop or tone symbol may be an essential part of the first fragment of quotation no stop is needed at either end of such insertions as he said to part them from the quotation that being sufficiently done by the quotation marks from these considerations we deduce the following rules the true stops should never stand before the second quotation mark except a when as in dialogue given without framework complete sentences entirely isolated and independent in grammar are printed as quotations even in these it must be mentioned that the true stops are strictly unnecessary but if the full stop which alone can here be in question is used in deference to universal custom it should be before the quotation mark b when a stop is necessary to divide the first fragment of an interrupted quotation from the second words that interrupt quotations should never be allowed stops to part them from the quotation the tone symbols should be placed before or after the second quotation mark according as they belong to the quotation or to the containing sentence if both quotation and containing sentence need a tone symbol both should be used with the quotation mark between them the bracketed numbers before the examples repeat the numbers of the rules views advocated by dr whately in his well known essays it is enough for us to reflect that such shortlived wits do wither as they grow we hear that whom the gods love die young and thenceforth we collect the cases that illustrate it a you are breaking the rules well the rules are silly b certainly not he exclaimed i would have died rather i can not guess he retorted what you mean but why drag in velasquez but what is the use of saying call no man happy till he dies is the question where was he or what was he doing how absurd to ask can a thing both be and not be if indignation is excited by the last two monstrosities we can only say what has been implied many other times in this book that the right substitute for correct ugliness is not incorrect prettiness but correct prettiness there is never any difficulty in rewriting sentences like these is the question where he was c can a thing both be and not be the question is absurd but it should be recognized that if such sentences are to be written there is only one way to punctuate them it may be of interest to show how these sentences stand in the books st sentence essays nd grow rd young th as here th not he exclaimed rather th guess he retorted mean th velasquez th saying dies the last two are fabricated the objections may now be considered the passing crowd is a phrase coined in the spirit of indifference yet to a man of what plato calls universal sympathies and even to the plain ordinary denizens of this world what can be more interesting than the passing crowd b after giving this example beadnell says the reason is clear the words quoted are those of another but the question is the writer s own nevertheless for the sake of neatness the ordinary points such as the comma semicolon colon and full stop precede the quotation marks in instances analogous to the one quoted but the exclamation follows the same rule as the interrogation singularly enough the stops that are according to this always to precede the quotation mark for the analogous cases are the only cases in which the outside position would be so much as considered are just the ones that by our rules ought hardly ever to do so whereas the two that are sometimes allowed the outside position are the two that we admit to be as often necessary inside as outside neatness is the sole consideration just as the ears may be regarded as not hearing organs but handsome volutes of the human capital so quotation marks may be welcomed as giving a good picturesque finish to a sentence those who are of this way of thinking must feel that if they allowed outside them anything short of fine handsome stops like the exclamation and question marks they would be countenancing an anticlimax but they are really mere conservatives masquerading only as aesthetes and their conservatism will soon have to yield argument on the subject is impossible it is only a question whether the printer s love for the old ways that seem to him so neat or the writer s and reader s desire to be understood and to understand fully is to prevail another objector takes a stronger position he admits that logic and not beauty must decide but before we give up the old let us be sure we are giving it up for a new that is logical he invites our attention to the recent paragraph containing beadnell s views why in the last sentence of that paragraph is the full stop outside but the exclamation follows the same rule as the interrogation is a complete sentence quoted why should its full stop be separated from it the answer is that the full stop is not its full stop it needs no stop having its communications forward absolutely cut off by the quotation mark it is a delusion to suppose that any sentence has proprietary rights in a stop though it may have in a tone symbol a stop is placed after it merely to separate it from what follows if necessary and the full stop after every last sentence not a question or exclamation of a paragraph chapter or book is illogical and only to be allowed like those in the isolated quotations mentioned in rule a in deference to universal custom our full stop belongs not to the last sentence of the quotation but to the paragraph which is all one sentence the whole quotation simply playing the part helped by the quotation marks of object to says but says is followed by a colon and a colon between verb and object breaks your own rules no is something different from a stop it is an extra quotation mark as much a conventional symbol as the full stop in m a and other abbreviations well then instead of says read continues to which the quotation clearly can not be object will that affect our full stop no the quotation will still be part of the sentence not indeed a noun as before and object to the verb but an adverb simply equivalent to thus attached to the verb satisfied on that point the objector takes up our statement that the quotation mark cuts communications a similar statement was made in the dashes section about brackets and double dashes he submits a quotation some people grunt and sweat under very easy burdens indeed and a pair of brackets it is not a little learning but much conceit that is a dangerous thing it is surely not true that either quotation mark or bracket cuts the communications there under in the quotation but in the brackets are in very active communication with burdens and conceit outside the answer is that these are merely convenient misuses of quotation marks and brackets a quotation and a parenthesis should be complete in themselves and instances that are not so may be neglected in arguing out principles special rules might indeed be required in consequence for the abnormal cases but in practice this is not so with quotations a last point to adapt one of your instances here are two sets of sentences stopped as i gather you would stop them he asked me can a thing both be and not be the question is absurd he said a thing can not both be and not be i at once agreed now if the full stop is required after the quotation mark in the second it must be required after that in the first in each case to part not the quotation but the containing sentence from the next sentence what right have you to omit the full stop in the first none whatever it will not be omitted so we have an addition of some importance to the monstrosities you said we should have to avoid well sentences of this type are not common except in a style of affected simplicity or real simplicity he saith unto him the third time simon son of jonas lovest thou me and is there any particular simplicity real or affected about this richmond looked at him with an odd smile for a moment or two before asking as if it were the most natural question in the world but is it true in the bible quotation there is as you say real simplicity or rather there was that sort of simplicity now would not be real but artificial any one who has good reason to imitate primitive style may imitate primitive punctuation too but one step forward in precision we have definitely taken from the biblical typography we should insist on quotation marks in such a sentence they do not seem pedantic or needless now nor will a further step in precision seem so when once it has been taken and as to your richmond sentence and monstrosities in general it may be confessed here as we are out of hearing in this discussion of all but those who are really interested that the word was used for the benefit only of those who are indifferent a sentence with two stops is not a monstrosity if it wants them and that will be realized if once sensible punctuation gets the upper hand of neatness these are the most plausible objections on principle to a system of using quotation marks with stops that would be in the main logical it may be thought however that it was our business to be practical and opportunist and suggest nothing that could not be acted on at once but general usage besides being illogical is so inconsistent different writers improving upon it in special details that appeal to them that it seemed simpler to give our idea of what would be the best attainable and trust to the tiro s adopting any parts of it that may not frighten him by their unaccustomed look there are single and double quotation marks and apart from minor peculiarities two ways of utilizing the variety the prevailing one is to use double marks for most purposes and single ones for quotations within quotations as well so he said to me what do you mean by it and i said i didn t mean anything some of those who follow this system also use the single marks for isolated words short phrases and anything that can hardly be called a formal quotation this avoids giving much emphasis to such expressions which is an advantage the more logical method is that adopted for instance by the oxford university press of reserving the double marks exclusively for quotations within quotations besides the loss of the useful degrees in emphasis sure however to be inconsistently utilized there is a certain lack of full dress effect about important quotations when given this way but that is probably a mere matter of habituation it should be mentioned that most of the quoted quotations in this section had originally the double marks but have been altered to suit the more logical method and the unpleasantness of the needless quotation marks with which we started has so been slightly toned down a common mistake of no great importance but resulting in more or less discomfort or perplexity to the reader is the placing of the first quotation mark earlier than the place where quotation really begins the commonest form of it is the including of the quoter s introductory that which it is often obvious that the original did not contain generally speaking if that is used the quotation marks may be dispensed with not however if the exact phraseology is important but at least the mark should be in the right place i remember an old scholastic aphorism which says that the man who lives wholly detached from others must be either an angel or a devil burke as the aphorism descends through latin from aristotle the precise english words are of no importance and the quotation marks might as well be away at least the first should be after that then with a sarvant sir to me he took himself into the kitchen borrow clearly a is not included in the quotation they make it perfectly clear and plain he informed the house that sir antony macdonnell was invited by him rather as a colleague than as a mere under secretary to register my will times the change from him to my would be quite legitimate if the first quotation mark stood before rather instead of where it does as it stands it is absurd it is long since he partook of the holy communion though there was an easterday of which he writes when he might have remained quietly in his corner during the office if times the his is evidently bracketed to show that it is substituted for the original writer s my this is very conscientious but it follows that either the same should have been done for he or the quotation mark should be after he we began this section by saying that quotation marks should be used only when necessary a question that affects the decision to some extent is the difference between direct indirect and half and half quotation we can say he said i will go he said he would go he said he would go the first variety is often necessary for the sake of vividness the third is occasionally justified when though there is no occasion for vividness there is some turn of phrase that it is important for the reader to recognize as actually originating not with the writer but with the person quoted otherwise that variety is to be carefully avoided how disagreeable it is will appear in the example below for ordinary purposes the second variety which involves no quotation marks is the best he then followed my example declared he never felt more refreshed in his life and giving a bound said he would go and look after his horses borrow further there may be quotation not of other people s words but of one s own thoughts in this case the method prevailing at present is that exemplified in the times extract below taken by itself there is no objection to it we point out however that it is irreconcilable with the principles explained in this section which demand the addition of a full stop derived that would be a worse monstrosity than the one in the first of the three legitimate alternatives that we add we recommend that the times method should be abandoned and the first or second of the others used according to circumstances the next question is whence is this income derived times the next question is whence is this income derived full direct quotation observe the monstrosity stop the next question is whence this income is derived indirect quotation the next question is whence this income is derived indirect quotation with quotation marks or half and half quotation like the borrow sentence in concluding the chapter on punctuation we may make the general remark that the effect of our recommendations whether advocating as in the last section more strictness or as in other parts more liberty would be certainly a considerable reduction in the number of diacritical marks cutting up and disfiguring the text and as we think a practice in most respects more logical and comprehensible footnotes see chapter syntax section relatives of course however the rhetorical question is often not as here the

ecstasy and what no language will explain smollett sentence accent it is only necessary to read aloud any one of the sentences quoted below to perceive at once that there is something wrong with its accentuation to lay down rules on this point would be superfluous even if it were practicable for in all doubtful cases the ear can and should decide a writer who can not trust himself to balance his sentences properly should read aloud all that he writes it is useless for him to argue that readers will not read his work aloud and that therefore the fault of which we are speaking will escape notice for although the fault may appear to be exclusively one of sound it is always in fact a fault of sense unnatural accentuation is only the outward sign of an unnatural combination of thought thus nine readers out of ten would detect in a moment without reading aloud the ill judged structure in our first example the writer has tried to do two incompatible things at the same time to describe in some detail the appearance of his characters and to begin a conversation the result is that any one reading the sentence aloud is compelled to maintain through several lines of new and essential information the tone that is appropriate only to what is treated as a matter of course the interrogative tone protests more loudly than any other against this kind of mismanagement but our examples will show that other tones are liable to the same abuse the accentuation of each clause or principal member of a sentence is primarily fixed by its relation to the other members when the internal claims of its own component parts clash with this fixed accentuation when for instance what should be read with a uniformly declining accentuation requires for its own internal purposes a marked rise and fall of accent reconstruction is necessary to avoid a badly balanced sentence the passage from peacock will illustrate this after pupils and still more after counterpoint the accentuation should steadily decline to the end of the passage but conflicting with this requirement we have the exorbitant claims of a complete anecdote containing within itself an elaborately accented speech to represent the anecdote as an insignificant appendage to pupils was a fault of sense it is revealed to the few who would not have perceived it by the impossibility of reading the passage naturally are japanese aprils always as lovely as this asked the man in the light tweed suit of two others in immaculate flannels with crimson sashes round their waists and puggarees folded in

circumstance wondered at it will not do the double work of announcing both the wonder and the thing wondered at i wondered at smith s being there implies that my hearer knew that smith was there if he did not i should say i was surprised to find accordingly in this very artificial sentence the writer presupposes the inconceivable question what were her feelings on finding that she had drifted tribulation bell to read a sentence of minute and striking description with the declining accentuation that necessarily follows the verb wondered is of course impossible how doth the earth terrifie and oppress us with terrible earthquakes which are most frequent in china japan and those eastern climes swallowing up sometimes six cities at once burton of the many possible violations of sentence accent one common in inferior writers is illustrated in the next section causal as clauses there are two admissible kinds of causal as clauses the pure and the mixed the pure clause assigns as a cause some fact that is already known to the reader and is sure to occur to him in the connexion the mixed assigns as a cause what is not necessarily known to the reader or present in his mind it has the double function of conveying a new fact and indicating its relation to the main sentence context will usually decide whether an as clause is pure or mixed in the following examples it is clear from the nature of the two clauses that the first is pure the second mixed i have an edition with german notes but that is of no use as you do not read german i caught the train but afterwards wished i had not as i presently discovered that my luggage was left behind the second of these it will be noticed is unreadable unless we slur the as to such an extent as practically to acknowledge that it ought not to be there the reason is that although a pure clause may stand at any point in the sentence a mixed one must always precede the main statement the pure clause having only the subordinate function normally indicated by as is subordinate in sense as well as in grammar and the declining accentuation with which it is accordingly pronounced will not be interfered with wherever we may place it but the mixed clause has another function that of conveying a new fact for which as does not prepare us and which entitles it to an accentuation as full and as varied as that of the main statement to neutralize the subordinating effect of as and secure the proper accentuation we must place the clause at the beginning where this is not practicable as should be removed and a colon or semi colon used instead of a comma persistent usage tends of course to remove this objection by weakening the subordinating power of conjunctions because while whereas since can be used where as still betrays a careless or illiterate writer there is the same false ring in all the following sentences i myself saw in the estate office of a large landed proprietor a procession of peasant women begging for assistance as owing to the departure of the bread winners the families were literally starving times remove as and use a heavier stop very true jasper but you really ought to learn to read as by so doing you might learn your duty towards yourselves borrow to read by so doing there was a barber and hairdresser who had been at paris and talked french with a cockney accent the french sounding all the better as no accent is so melodious as the cockney borrow use a semicolon and for the assertion requires all the support that vigorous accentuation can lend one of the very few institutions for which the popish church entertains any fear and consequently respect as it respects nothing which it does not fear borrow for instead of as will best suit this illogical and falsely coordinated sentence everybody likes to know that his advantages can not be attributed to air soil sea or to local wealth as mines and quarries but to superior brain as it makes the praise more personal to him emerson again the clause is a mixed one the point of view it suggests is indeed sufficiently obvious but unlike our typical pure clause above you do not know german it depends for its existence upon the circumstances of the main sentence which may or may not have occurred to the reader before the full accentuation with which the clause must inevitably be read condemns it at once use a colon and remove as pure clauses being from their nature more or less otiose belong rather to the spoken than to the written language it follows that a good writer will seldom have a causal as clause of any kind at the end of a sentence two further limitations remain to be noticed i when the cause not the effect is obviously the whole point of the sentence because not as should be used the following is quite impossible english i make these remarks as quick shooting at short ranges has lately been so strongly recommended times ii as should be used only to give the cause of the thing asserted not the cause of the assertion nor an illustration of its truth as in the following instances you refer me to the encyclopaedia you are mistaken as i find the encyclopaedia exactly confirms my view the oxford coxswain did not steer a very good course here as he kept too close in to the middlesex shore to obtain full advantage of the tide it made little difference however as his crew continued to gain times my finding the encyclopaedia s confirmation was not the cause of mistake nor the keeping too close the cause of bad steering wens and hypertrophied members no sentence is to be condemned for mere length a really skilful writer can fill a page with one and not tire his reader though a succession of long sentences without the relief of short ones interspersed is almost sure to be forbidding but the tiro and even the good writer who is not prepared to take the trouble of reading aloud what he has written should confine himself to the easily manageable the tendency is to allow some part of a sentence to develop unnatural proportions or a half parenthetic insertion to separate too widely the essential parts the cure indispensable for every one who aims at a passable style and infallible for any one who has a good ear is reading aloud after writing disproportionate insertions some simple eloquence distinctly heard though only uttered in her eyes unconscious that he read them as by the

the subject of the active verb have attempted is definite and can conveniently be stated the active form should always be retained to write it had been attempted by the founders of the study to supply instead of the founders had attempted to supply is mere perversity when as in some of our examples below the subject of the active verb have attempted is indefinite the passive turn is sometimes

if the writer means what he says and the grounds of the deduction are not included in the sentence reconstruction is not obvious and that is perhaps wanted to pick up the thread but if as may be

objection to split compound verbs as to split infinitives prefer to place any adverb or qualifying phrase not between the auxiliary and the other component but before both provided that the adverb is then separated from the auxiliary no harm is done evidently he was mistaken is often as good as he was evidently mistaken and suits all requirements of accentuation but the placing of the adverb immediately before or after the auxiliary depends according to established usage upon the relative importance of the two components when the main accent is to fall upon the second component the normal place of the adverb is between the two it is only when the same verb is repeated with a change in the tense or mood of the auxiliary that the adverb should come first he evidently was deceived implies or should imply that the verb deceived has been used before and that the point of the sentence depends upon the emphatic auxiliary accordingly we should write the possibility of his being deceived had never occurred to me but he evidently was deceived but i relied implicitly on his knowledge of the facts but he was evidently deceived in our first two examples below the adverb is rightly placed first to secure the emphasis on the auxiliary in all the others the above principle of accentuation is violated the same order of words is required by the copula with whatever kind of complement i

of the kind are very common and should be carefully guarded against he gloats over the facilities the excesses and the blunders of the authorities have given his comrades for revolutionary action

subordinate carlyle that there is no comma between facilities and the excesses is no defence seeing how often commas go wrong indeed the comma after age in the second piece which is strictly wrong is a proof how little reliance is to be placed on such signs misplacement of words generous interpretation will generally get at a writer s meaning but for him to rely on that is to appeal ad

judgement is required a captious critic might find examples on almost every page of almost any writer but most of them though they may strictly be called ambiguous would be quite justifiable on the other hand a careless writer can nearly always plead even for a bad offence that an attentive reader would take the thing the right way that is no defence a rather inattentive and sleepy reader is the

macaulay the disclosure of the stores of greek literature had wrought the revolution of the renascence the disclosure of the older mass of hebrew literature wrought the revolution of the reformation j r green author s self consciousness you mean it is she said about bertie charlie made the noise usually written pshaw e f benson intrusive smartness another form of self consciousness round her lay piles of press notices which stripped the american variety of the english language bare of epithets e f benson income tax payers are always treated to the fine words which butter no parsnips and are always assured that it is really a danger to the state to go on skinning them in time of peace to such an extent as to leave little integument to remove in time of war times yet in the relentless city where no one may pause for a moment unless he wishes to be left behind in the great universal race for gold which begins as soon as a child can walk and ceases not until he is long past walking the climbing of the thermometer into the nineties is an acrobatic feat which concerns the thermometer only and at the junction of sixth avenue and broadway there was no slackening in the tides of the affairs of men e f benson miscellaneous types of journalese mr lionel phillips maintained that it was impossible to introduce white unskilled labour on a large scale as a payable proposition without lowering the position of the white man times how labour can be a proposition and how a proposition can be payable it is not easy to say the sentence seems to mean to introduce labour on a large scale and make it pay this is what comes of a fondness for abstracts they have not hitherto discovered the formula for the intelligent use of our unrivalled resources for the satisfaction of our security times this perhaps means they have not yet discovered how our unrivalled resources may be made to ensure our safety an attempt to efface the ill effects of the czar s refusal to see the workmen has been made by the grant of an interview by the czar at tsarkoe selo to a body of workmen officially selected to represent the masses spectator the powerful and convincing article on the question of war office administration as it affects the volunteers to be found in this month s national spectator the russian government is at last face to face with the greatest crisis of the war in the shape of the fact that the siberian railway spectator no year passes now without evidence of the truth of the statement that the work of government is becoming increasingly difficult spectator it has taken a leading part in protesting against the congo state s treatment of natives controlled by it and in procuring the pressure which the house of commons has put upon our government with a view to international insistence on fulfilment of the obligations entered upon by the congo government as regards native rights times the outcome of a desire to convince the government of the expediency of granting the return recently ordered by the house with regard to the names times in default of information of the result of the deliberations which it has been stated the imperial defence committee have been engaged in times the volunteer does not volunteer to be compelled to suffer long filthy and neglected illnesses and too often death yet such was south africa on a vast scale and is inevitable in war under the present official indifference times somewhat c indulgence in qualifying adverbs as perhaps possibly probably rather a little somewhat amounts with english journalists to a disease the intemperate orgy of moderation is renewed every morning as somewhat is rapidly swallowing up the rest we shall almost confine our attention to it and it is useless to deprecate the use without copious illustration examples will be classified under headings though these are not quite mutually exclusive somewhat clearly illogical a number of questions to the prime minister have been put upon the paper with the object of eliciting information as to the personnel of the proposed royal commission and the scope of their inquiry these are now somewhat belated in view of the official announcement made this morning times the announcement contained both the list of members and the full reference thrills which gave him rather a unique pleasure hutton russian despatches are somewhat inconsistent one of them stating that there is no change in the position of the armies while another says that the japanese advance continues times being faint with hunger i was somewhat in a listless condition bordering on stupor corelli in the light of these it would be hard to say what full belatedness inconsistency and listlessness may be somewhat with essentially emphatic words we may call a thing dirty or filthy if we choose the latter we mean to be emphatic it is absurd to use the emphatic word and take away its emphasis with somewhat when we might use the gentler word by itself a member of the legislative council is allowed now to speak in dutch if he can not express himself clearly in english under the proposed arrangement he will be able to decide for himself in which medium he can express himself the more clearly surely a somewhat infinitesimal point times thirdly it is rather agonizing at times to the philologist times the distances at which the movements are being conducted receive a somewhat startling illustration from the statement that times under these circumstances it is somewhat extraordinary to endeavour to save the government from blame times in various evidently well informed journals the somewhat amazing proposition is set up that times but unfortunately the word duties got accidentally substituted for bounties in two places and made the utterance somewhat unintelligible to the general reader times the songs are sung by students to the accompaniment of a somewhat agonizing band times there is a mysterious man killing orchid a great eastern jewel of state and many other properties some of them a little well worn suitable for the staging of a tale of mystery spectator some of the instances in these two classes would be defended as humorous under statement but if this hackneyed trick is an example of the national humour we had better cease making reflections on german want of humour somewhat shyly announcing an epigrammatic or well chosen phrase there is a very pretty problem awaiting the decision of prince b low and one which is entirely worthy of his somewhat acrobatic diplomacy times gaston engaged in a controversy on the origin of evil which terminated by his somewhat abruptly quitting his alma mater beaconsfield why even tennyson became an amateur milkman to somewhat conceal and excuse the shame and degradation of writing verse corelli the virtuous but somewhat unpleasing type of the roman nation times the sight of these soldiers and sailors sitting round camp fires in the midst of the snow in fashionable thoroughfares transforming the city into an armed camp is somewhat weird times while mary was trying to decipher these somewhat mystic lines s ferrier somewhat conveying a sneer it is somewhat strange that any one connected with this institution should be so unfamiliar with its regulations times that the conclusion arrived at by the shortest route is to be accepted a somewhat extravagant doctrine according to which balfour but very few points of general interest have been elicited in any quarter by these somewhat academic reflections times this somewhat glowing advertisement of the new loan times the genuine somewhat merely tame timid undecided conciliatory or polite it is somewhat pitiful to see the efforts of a foreign state directed not to the pursuit of its own aims by legitimate means but to the gratification of personal hostility to a great public servant of france times i am certain that the clergy themselves only too gladly acquiesce in this somewhat illogical division of labour times this no doubt is what professor ray lankester is driving at in his somewhat intemperate onslaught times the rather mysterious visit of s tittoni the italian foreign minister to germany times these are of rather remarkable promise the head shows an unusual power of realizing character under a purely ideal conception times the rather finely conceived statuette called the human task by mr oliver wheatley times it is somewhat the fashion to say that in these days times a letter from one whose learning and experience entitle him to be heard conceived as i think in a spirit of somewhat exaggerated pessimism times the statement made by the writer is somewhat open to doubt times i have read with much interest the letters on the subject of hush money especially as they account to me somewhat for the difficulties i have experienced times it would be valuable if he would somewhat expand his ideas regarding local defence by volunteers times sir i have been somewhat interested in the recent correspondence in your columns times so many persons of undoubted integrity believe in dowsing that he is a somewhat rash man who summarily dismisses the matter times sir francis bertie whose dislike of unnecessary publicity is somewhat pronounced times it is not too much to say that any one who hopes to write well had better begin by abjuring somewhat altogether we can not tell whether this long list will have a dissuasive effect or will be referred to foolish individual prejudice against an unoffending word but on the first assumption we should like to add that a not less dissuasive collection might easily be made of the intensifier distinctly than of the qualifier somewhat the use meant is that seen in the effect as the procession careers through the streets of berlin is described as distinctly interesting distinctly gives the patronizing interest as somewhat gives the contemptuous indifference with which a superior person is to be conceived surveying life and context too often reveals that the superiority is imaginary clumsy patching when a writer detects a fault in what he has written or thought of writing his best course is to recast the whole sentence the next best is to leave it alone the worst is to patch it in such a way that the reader has his attention drawn works out the original version and condemns his author for carelessness aggravated by too low an estimate of his own intelligence numerous allegations too were made of prejudiced treatment measured out against motorists by rural magistrates times avoidance of the jingle in meted out to motor ists no crew proved to be of the very highest class but this perhaps led the racing to be on the whole close and exciting times avoidance of the jingle in led to the rac ing be ing the lord mayor last night entertained the judges to a banquet at the mansion house times avoidance of double at the occupants talked inspected the cars of one another interchanged tales of times avoidance in grammatical pusillanimity of one another s cars who have only themselves in view by breaking through it richardson avoidance of double in he nodded as one who would say i have already thought of that crockett avoidance of the archaism which however is the only natural form as who should say it is now practically certain that the crews of nebogatoff s squadron were in a state of mutiny and that this is the explanation for the surrender of these vessels times avoidance of double of and for the first time after twenty years the whigs saw themselves again in power j r green avoidance of double for if after had been originally intended we should have had at last instead of for the first time and oppressive laws forced even these few with scant exceptions to profess protestantism j r green to avoid the repetition of few the affected word scant has been admitted given competition any line would vie with the others in mirrors and gilded furniture but if there is none why spend a penny not a passenger the less will travel because the mode of transit is bestial e f benson to avoid the overdone word beastly which however happens to be the right one here bestial describes character or conduct there is indeed a kind of timorous atheism in the man who dares not trust god to render all efforts to interpret his word and what is criticism but interpretation work together for good spectator render is substituted for make because make efforts might be taken as complete without the work together that is due unfortunately to render efforts work together is not even english at all omission of the conjunction that this is quite legitimate but often unpleasant it is partly a matter of idiom as i presume you know but i assume that you know partly of avoiding false scent as in the sixth example below where scheme might be object to discover in particular it is undesirable to omit that when a long clause or phrase intervenes between it and the subject and verb it introduces as in the first four examples and it is to be hoped as the tree planting season has arrived stepney will now put its scheme in hand times sir we notice in a leading article in your issue to day on the subject of the carriage of australian mails you imply that the increased price demanded by the orient pacific line was due to times lord balfour moved that it is necessary before the constituencies are asked to determine upon the desirability of such conference they should be informed first times lord spencer held that it was impossible with regard to a question which had broken up the government and disturbed the country they could go into a conference which times if the australian is to be convinced that is an unreasonable wish it will not be by arguments about taxation times i think he would discover the scheme unfolded and explained in them is a perfectly intelligible and comprehensive one times it is not till he cometh the ideal will be seen times and it is only by faith the evils you mention as productive of war can be cast out of our hearts times i do not wish it to be understood that i consider all those who applied for work during the past two winters and who are now seeking employment are impostors times i assume turkey would require such a cash payment of at least times tawno leaped into the saddle where he really looked like gunnar of hlitharend save and except the complexion of gunnar was florid whereas that of tawno was of nearly mulatto darkness borrow in some of these the motive is obvious to avoid one that clause depending on another the end was good but the means bad a more thorough recasting was called for meaningless while while originally temporal has a legitimate use also in contrasts the further colourless use of it whether with verb or with participle as a mere elegant variation for and is very characteristic of journalese and much to be deprecated of its value there can be no question the editor s article on constitutions for example and that of mr w wyse on law both well repay most careful study while when sir r jebb writes on literature dr henry jackson on philosophy or professor waldstein on sculpture their contributions must be regarded as authoritative spectator the fireman was killed on the spot and the driver as well as the guard of the passenger train was slightly injured while the up line was blocked for some time with d bris from broken trucks of the goods train times the deer on the island took some interest in the proceeding while the peacocks on the lawn screamed at the right time birmingham daily post it can not be contended that it is more profitable to convey a passenger the twenty four miles to yarmouth for payment than to accept the same payment without performing the service while if the company wish to discourage the use of cheap week end tickets why issue them at all times commercialisms certain uses of such the same and other words redolent of commerce and the law should be reserved for commercial and legal contexts anent which has been noticed in part i is a legalism of this kind in the bront instances quoted a twang of flippancy will be observed the other writers are probably unconscious this gentleman s state of mind was very harrowing and i was glad when he wound up his exposition of the same c bront the present was no occasion for showy array my dun

commemoration of the lord s supper as not being fit to receive the same daily telegraph but do the great majority of people let their belief in the hereafter affect their conduct with regard to the same i think not daily telegraph let us hope sir that it may be possible in your own interests to continue the same till the subject has had a good innings daily telegraph i believe and have believed since a tiny child made miserable by the loss of a shilling i prayed my heavenly father to help me to recover the same daily telegraph it is of course possible in this connexion that the prayer book is responsible for the same if i am refused the sacrament i do not believe that i shall have less chance of entering the kingdom of god than if i received such sacrament daily telegraph but when it comes to us following his life and example in all its intricate details all will i think agree that such is impossible daily telegraph an appeal to philanthropy is hardly necessary the grounds for such being so self evident times such a desire it should be the purpose of a unionist government to foster but such will not be attained under the present regime in dublin times regaling themselves on half pints at the said village hostelries borrow having read with much interest the letters re believe only now appearing in the daily telegraph daily telegraph he ruined himself and family by his continued experiments for the benefit of the british nation times pet phrases vivid writers must be careful not to repeat any conspicuous phrase so soon that a reader of ordinary memory has not had
