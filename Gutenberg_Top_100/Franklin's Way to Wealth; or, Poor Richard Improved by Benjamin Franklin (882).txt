price s mo bound the pagan mythology of ancient greece and rome versified accompanied with philosophical elucidations of the probable latent meaning of some of the fables of the ancients on a theory entirely new by r atkins illustrated by twenty two cuts on wood this little work is intended as an easy introduction to the mythology of ancient greece and rome and is particularly adapted to the use of schools being divested of the obscene allegories introduced by the ancients in their usual figurative style it is certainly better calculated to convey a general idea of the subject than any attempt of the kind which has yet fallen under our observation the poetical illustrations are simple and well calculated to the purpose of becoming a vehicle of instruction to juvenile minds and the elucidations of the fables are plausible and ingenious repository june sold by w and t darton holborn hill introduction dr franklin wishing to collect into one piece all the sayings upon the following subjects which he had dropped in the course of publishing the almanacks called poor richard introduces father abraham for this purpose hence it is that poor richard is so often quoted and that in the present title he is said to be improved notwithstanding the stroke of humour in the concluding paragraph of this address poor richard saunders and father abraham have proved in america that they are no common preachers and shall we brother englishmen refuse good sense and saving knowledge because it comes from the other side of the water the following may be had of the proprietors w t darton and

heard that nothing gives an author so great pleasure as to find his works respectfully quoted by others judge then how much i must have been gratified by an incident i am going to relate to you i stopped my horse lately where a great number of people were collected at an auction of merchants goods the hour of the sale not being come they were conversing on the badness of the times and one of the company called to a plain clean old man with white locks pray father abraham what think you of the times will not those heavy taxes quite ruin the country how shall we be ever able to pay them what would you advise us to father abraham stood up and replied if you would have my advice i will give it you in short for a word to the wise is enough as poor richard says they joined in desiring him to speak his mind and gathering round him he proceeded as follows friends says he the taxes are indeed very heavy and if those laid on by the government were the only ones we had to pay we might more easily discharge them but we have many others and much more grievous to some of us we are taxed twice as much by our idleness three times as much by our pride and four times as much by our folly and from these taxes the commissioners can not ease or deliver us by allowing an abatement however let us hearken to good advice and something may be done for us god helps them that help themselves as poor richard says i it would be thought a hard government that should tax its people one tenth part of their time to be employed in its service but idleness taxes many of us much more sloth by bringing on diseases absolutely shortens life illustration published by w darton junr octr sloth like rust consumes faster than labour wears while the used key is always bright as poor richard says but dost thou love life then do not squander time for that is the stuff life is made of as poor richard says how much more than is necessary do we spend in sleep forgetting that the sleeping fox catches no poultry and that there will be sleeping enough in the grave as poor richard says illustration if time be of all things the most precious wasting time must be as poor richard says the greatest prodigality since as he elsewhere tells us lost time is never found again and what we call time enough always proves little enough let us then up and be doing and doing to the purpose so by diligence shall we do more with less perplexity sloth makes all things difficult but industry all easy and he that riseth late must trot all day and shall scarce overtake his business at night while laziness travels so slowly that poverty soon overtakes him drive thy business let not that drive thee and early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise as poor richard says illustration the sun shone yesterday and i would not work to day it rains and i can not work so what signifies wishing and hoping for better times we may make these times better if we bestir ourselves industry need not wish and he that lives upon hope will die fasting there are no gains without pains then help hands for i have no lands or if i have they are smartly taxed he that hath a trade hath an estate and he that hath a calling hath an office of profit and honour as poor richard says but then the trade must be worked at and the calling well followed or neither the estate nor the office will enable us to pay our taxes if we are industrious we shall never starve for at the working man s house hunger looks in but dares not enter nor will the bailiff or the constable enter for industry pays debts while despair increaseth them what though you have found no treasure nor has any rich relation left you a legacy diligence is the mother of good luck and god gives all things to industry then plow deep while sluggards sleep and you shall have corn to sell and to keep work while it is called to day for you know not how much you may be hindered to morrow one to day is worth two to morrows as poor richard says and farther never leave that till to morrow which you can do to day if you were a servant would you not be ashamed that a good master should catch you idle are you then your own master be ashamed to catch yourself idle when there is so much to be done for yourself your family your country and your king handle your tools without mittens remember that the cat in gloves catches no mice as poor richard says it is true there is much to be done and perhaps you are weak handed but stick to it steadily and you will see great effects for constant dropping wears away stones and by diligence and patience the mouse ate in two the cable and little strokes fell great oaks illustration methinks i hear some of you say must a man afford himself no leisure i will tell thee my friend what poor richard says employ thy time well if thou meanest to gain leisure and since thou art not sure of a minute throw not away an hour leisure is time for doing something useful this leisure the diligent man will obtain but the lazy man never for a life of leisure and a life of laziness are two things many without labour would live by their wits only but they break for want of stock whereas industry gives comfort and plenty and respect fly pleasures and they will follow you the diligent spinner has a large shift and now i have a sheep and a cow every body bids me good morrow ii but with our industry we must likewise be steady settled and careful and oversee our own affairs with our own eyes and not trust too much to others for as poor richard says i never saw an oft removed tree nor yet an oft removed family that throve so well as those that settled be and again three removes are as bad as a fire and again keep thy shop and thy shop will keep thee and again if you would have your business done go if not send and again he that by the plow would thrive himself must either hold or drive and again the eye of the master will do more work than both his hands and again want of care does us more damage than want of knowledge and again not to oversee workmen is to leave them your purse open illustration published by w darton junr octr illustration published by w darton junr octr trusting too much to others care is the ruin of many for in the affairs of this world men are saved not by faith but by the want of it but a man s own care is profitable for if you would have a faithful servant and one that you like serve yourself a little neglect may breed great mischief for want of a nail the shoe was lost for want of a shoe the horse was lost and for want of a horse the rider was lost being overtaken and slain by the enemy all for want of a little care about a horse shoe nail iii so much for industry my friends and attention to one s own business but to these we must add frugality if we would make our industry more certainly successful a man may if he knows not how to save as he gets keep his nose all his life to the grindstone and die not worth a groat at last a fat kitchen makes a lean will and many estates are spent in the getting since women for tea forsook spinning and knitting and men for punch forsook hewing and splitting if you would be wealthy think of saving as well as of getting the indies have not made spain rich because her out goes are greater than her incomes illustration published by w darton junr octr illustration away then with your expensive follies and you will not then have so much cause to complain of hard times heavy taxes and chargeable families for women and wine game and deceit make the wealth small and the want great and farther what maintains one vice would bring up two children you may think perhaps that a little tea or a little punch now and then diet a little more costly clothes a little finer and a little entertainment now and then can be no great matter but remember many a little makes a mickle beware of little expences a small leak will sink a great ship as poor richard says and again who dainties love shall beggars prove and moreover fools make feasts and wise men eat them here you are all got together to this sale of fineries and nick nacks you call them goods but if you do not take care they will prove evils to some of you you expect they will be sold cheap and perhaps they may for less than they cost but if you have no occasion for them they must be dear to you remember what poor richard says buy what thou hast no need of and ere long thou shalt sell thy necessaries and again at a great pennyworth pause a while he means that perhaps the cheapness is apparent only and not real or the bargain by straitening thee in thy business may do thee more harm than good for in another place he says many have been ruined by buying good pennyworths again it is foolish to lay out money in a purchase of repentance and yet this folly is practised every day at auctions for want of minding the almanack many a one for the sake of finery on the back have gone with a hungry belly and half starved their families silks and satins scarlet and velvets put out the kitchen fire as poor richard says these are not the necessaries of life they can scarcely be called the conveniences and yet only because they look pretty how many want to have them by these and other extravagancies the genteel are reduced to poverty and forced to borrow of those whom they formerly despised but who through industry and frugality have maintained their standing in which case it appears plainly that a ploughman on his legs is higher than a gentleman on his knees as poor richard says perhaps they have had a small estate left them which they knew not the getting of they think it is day and will never be night that a little to be spent out of so much is not worth minding but always taking out of the meal tub and never putting in soon comes to the bottom as poor richard says and then when the well is dry they know the worth of water but this they might have known before if they had taken his advice if you would know the value of money go and try to borrow some for he that goes a borrowing goes a sorrowing as poor richard says and indeed so does he that lends to such people when he goes to get it in again poor dick farther advises and says fond pride of dress is sure a very curse ere fancy you consult consult your purse illustration published by w darton junr octr and again pride is as loud a beggar as want and a great deal more saucy when you have bought one fine thing you must buy ten more that your appearance may be all of a piece but poor dick says it is easier to suppress the first desire than to satisfy all that follow it and it is as truly folly for the poor to ape the rich as for the frog to swell in order to equal the ox vessels large may venture more but little boats should keep near shore it is however a folly soon punished for as poor richard says pride that dines on vanity sups on contempt pride breakfasted with plenty dined with poverty and supped with infamy and after all of what use is this pride of appearance for which so much is risked so much is suffered it can not promote health nor ease pain it makes no increase of merit in the person it creates envy it hastens misfortune but what madness it must be to run in debt for these superfluities we are offered by the terms of this sale six months credit and that perhaps has induced some of us to attend it because we can not spare the ready money and hope now to be fine without it but ah think what you do when you run in debt you give to another power over your liberty if you can not pay at the time you will be ashamed to see your creditor you will be in fear when you speak to him you will make poor pitiful sneaking excuses and by degrees come to lose your veracity and sink into base downright lying for the second vice is lying the first is running in debt as poor richard says and again to the same purpose lying rides upon debt s back whereas a free born englishman ought not to be ashamed nor afraid to see or speak to any man living but poverty often deprives a man of all spirit and virtue it is hard for an empty bag to stand upright what would you think of that prince or of that government who should issue an edict forbidding you to dress like a gentleman or gentlewoman on pain of imprisonment or servitude would you not say that you were free have a right to dress as you please and that such an edict would be a breach of your privileges and such a government tyrannical and yet you are about to put yourself under that tyranny when you run in debt for such dress your creditor has authority at his pleasure to deprive you of your liberty by confining you in gaol for life or by selling you for a servant if you should not be able to pay him when you have got your bargain you may perhaps think little of payment but as poor richard says creditors have better memories than debtors creditors are a superstitious sect great observers of set days and times the day comes round before you are aware and the demand is made before you are prepared to satisfy it or if you bear your debt in mind the term which at first seemed so long will as it lessens appear extremely short time will seem to have added wings to his heels as well as his shoulders those have a short lent who owe money to be paid at easter at present perhaps you may think yourselves in thriving circumstances and that you can bear a little extravagance without injury but for age and want save while you may no morning sun lasts a whole day gain may be temporary and uncertain but ever while you live expense is constant and certain and it is easier to build two chimneys than to keep one in fuel as poor richard says so rather go to bed supper less than rise in debt get what you can and what you get hold tis the stone that will turn all your lead into gold and when you have got the philosopher s stone sure you will no longer complain of bad times or the difficulty of paying taxes iv this doctrine my friends is reason and wisdom but after all do not depend too much upon your own industry and frugality and prudence though excellent things for they may all be blasted without the blessing of heaven and therefore ask that blessing humbly and be not uncharitable to those that at present seem to want it but comfort and help them remember job suffered and was afterwards prosperous illustration and now to conclude experience keeps a dear school but fools will learn in no other as poor richard says and scarce in that for it is true we may give advice but we can not give conduct however remember this they that will not be counselled can not be helped and farther that if you will not hear reason she will surely rap your knuckles as poor richard says thus the old gentleman ended his harangue the people heard it and approved the doctrine and immediately practised the contrary just as if it had been a common sermon for the auction opened and they began to buy extravagantly i found the good man had thoroughly studied my almanacks and digested all i had dropt on those topics during the course of twenty five years the frequent mention he made of me must have tired any one else but my vanity was wonderfully delighted with it though i was conscious that not a tenth part of the wisdom was my own which he ascribed to me but rather the gleanings that i had made of the sense of all ages and nations however i resolved to be the better for the echo of it and though i had at first determined to buy stuff for a new coat i went away resolved to wear my old one a little longer reader if thou wilt do the same thy profit will be as great as mine i am as ever thine to serve thee richard saunders illustration finis w and t darton printers holborn hill london
