county attorney henry peters sheriff lewis hale a neighboring farmer mrs peters mrs hale scene the kitchen is the now abandoned farmhouse of john wright a gloomy kitchen and left without having been put in order unwashed pans under the sink a loaf of bread outside the bread box a dish towel on the table other signs of incompleted work at the rear the outer door opens and the sheriff comes in followed by the county attorney and hale the sheriff and hale are men in middle life the county attorney is a young man all are much bundled up and go at once to the stove they are followed by the two women the sheriff s wife first she is a slight wiry woman a thin nervous face mrs hale is larger and would ordinarily be called more comfortable looking but she is disturbed now and looks fearfully about as she enters the women have come in slowly and stand close together near the door county attorney rubbing his hands this feels good come up to the fire ladies mrs peters after taking a step forward i m not cold sheriff unbuttoning his overcoat and stepping away from the stove as if to mark the beginning of official business now mr hale before we move things about you explain to mr henderson just what you saw when you came here yesterday morning county attorney by the way has anything been moved are things just as you left them yesterday sheriff looking about it s just the same when it dropped below zero last night i thought i d better send frank out this morning to make a fire for us no use getting pneumonia with a big case on but i told him not to touch anything except the stove and you know frank county attorney somebody should have been left here yesterday sheriff oh yesterday when i had to send frank to morris center for that man who went crazy i want you to know i had my hands full yesterday i knew you could get back from omaha by today and as long as i went over everything here myself county attorney well mr hale tell just what happened when you came here yesterday morning hale harry and i had started to town with a load of potatoes we came along the road from my place and as i got here i said i m going to see if i can t get john wright to go in with me on a party telephone i spoke to wright about it once before and he put me off saying folks talked too much anyway and all he asked was peace and quiet i guess you know about how much he talked himself but i thought maybe if i went to the house and talked about it before his wife though i said to harry that i didn t know as what his wife wanted made much difference to john county attorney let s talk about that later mr hale i do want to talk about that but tell now just what happened when you got to the house hale i didn t hear or see anything i knocked at the door and still it was all quiet inside i knew they must be up it was past eight o clock so i knocked again and i thought i heard somebody say come in i wasn t sure i m not sure yet but i opened the door this door indicating the door by which the two women are still standing and there in that rocker pointing to it sat mrs wright they all look at the rocker county attorney what was she doing hale she was rockin back and forth she had her apron in her hand and was kind of pleating it county attorney and how did she look hale well she looked queer county attorney how do you mean queer hale well as if she didn t know what she was going to do next and kind of done up county attorney how did she seem to feel about your coming hale why i don t think she minded one way or other she didn t pay much attention i said how do mrs wright it s cold ain t it and she said is it and went on kind of pleating at her apron well i was surprised she didn t ask me to come up to the stove or to set down but just sat there not even looking at me so i said i want to see john and then she laughed i guess you would call it a laugh i thought of harry and the team outside so i said a little sharp can t i see john no she says kind o dull like ain t he home says i yes says she he s home then why can t i see him i asked her out of patience cause he s dead says she dead says i she just nodded her head not getting a bit excited but rockin back and forth why where is he says i not knowing what to say she just pointed upstairs like that himself pointing to the room above i got up with the idea of going up there i walked from there to here then i says why what did he die of he died of a rope round his neck says she and just went on pleatin at her apron well i went out and called harry i thought i might need help we went upstairs and there he was lyin county attorney i think i d rather have you go into that upstairs where you can point it all out just go on now with the rest of the story hale well my first thought was to get that rope off it looked stops his face twitches but harry he went up to him and he said no he s dead all right and we d better not touch anything so we went back down stairs she was still sitting that same way has anybody been notified i asked no says she unconcerned who did this mrs wright said harry he said it business like and she stopped pleatin of her apron i don t know she says you don t know says harry no says she weren t you sleepin in the bed with him says harry yes says she but i was on the inside somebody slipped a rope round his neck and strangled him and you didn t wake up says harry i didn t wake up she said after him we must a looked as if we didn t see how that could be for after a minute she said i sleep sound harry was going to ask her more questions but i said maybe we ought to let her tell her story first to the coroner or the sheriff so harry went fast as he could to rivers place where there s a telephone county attorney and what did mrs wright do when she knew that you had gone for the coroner hale she moved from that chair to this one over here pointing to a small chair in the corner and just sat there with her hands held together and looking down i got a feeling that i ought to make some conversation so i said i had come in to see if john wanted to put in a telephone and at that she started to laugh and then she stopped and looked at me scared the county attorney who has had his notebook out makes a note i dunno maybe it wasn t scared i wouldn t like to say it was soon harry got back and then dr lloyd came and you mr peters and so i guess that s all i know that you don t county attorney looking around i guess we ll go upstairs first and then out to the barn and around there to the sheriff you re convinced that there was nothing important here nothing that would point to any motive sheriff nothing here but kitchen things the county attorney after again looking around the kitchen opens the door of a cupboard closet he gets up on a chair and looks on a shelf pulls his hand away sticky county attorney here s a nice mess the women draw nearer mrs peters to the other woman oh her fruit it did freeze to the lawyer she worried about that when it turned so cold she said the fire d go out and her jars would break sheriff well can you beat the women held for murder and worryin about her preserves county attorney i guess before we re through she may have something more serious than preserves to worry about hale well women are used to worrying over trifles the two women move a little closer together county attorney with the gallantry of a young politician and yet for all their worries what would we do without the ladies the women do not unbend he goes to the sink takes a dipperful of water from the pail and pouring it into a basin washes his hands starts to wipe them on the roller towel turns it for a cleaner place dirty towels kicks his foot against the pans under the sink not much of a housekeeper would you say ladies mrs hale stiffly there s a great deal of work to be done on a farm county attorney to be sure and yet with a little bow to her i know there are some dickson county farmhouses which do not have such roller towels he gives it a pull to expose its length again mrs hale those towels get dirty awful quick men s hands aren t always as clean as they might be county attorney ah loyal to your sex i see but you and mrs wright were neighbors i suppose you were friends too mrs hale shaking her head i ve not seen much of her of late years i ve not been in this house it s more than a year county attorney and why was that you didn t like her mrs hale i liked her all well enough farmers wives have their hands full mr henderson and then county attorney yes mrs hale looking about it never seemed a very cheerful place county attorney no it s not cheerful i shouldn t say she had the homemaking instinct mrs hale well i don t know as wright had either county attorney you mean that they didn t get on very well mrs hale no i don t mean anything but i don t think a place d be any cheerfuller for john wright s being in it county attorney i d like to talk more of that a little later i want to get the lay of things upstairs now he goes to the left where three steps lead to a stair door sheriff i suppose anything mrs peters does ll be all right she was to take in some clothes for her you know and a few little things we left in such a hurry yesterday county attorney yes but i would like to see what you take mrs peters and keep an eye out for anything that might be of use to us mrs peters yes mr henderson the women listen to the men s steps on the stairs then look about the kitchen mrs hale i d hate to have men coming into my kitchen snooping around and criticising she arranges the pans under sink which the lawyer had shoved out of place mrs peters of course it s no more than their duty mrs hale duty s all right but i guess that deputy sheriff that came out to make the fire might have got a little of this on gives the roller towel a pull wish i d thought of that sooner seems mean to talk about her for not having things slicked up when she had to come away in such a hurry mrs peters who has gone to a small table in the left rear corner of the room and lifted one end of a towel that covers a pan she had bread set stands still mrs hale eyes fixed on a loaf of bread beside the bread box which is on a low shelf at the other side of the room moves slowly toward it she was going to put this in there picks up loaf then abruptly drops it in a manner of returning to familiar things it s a shame about her fruit i wonder if it s all gone gets up on the chair and looks i think there s some here that s all right mrs peters yes here holding it toward the window this is cherries too looking again i declare i believe that s the only one gets down bottle in her hand goes to the sink and wipes it off on the outside she ll feel awful bad after all her hard work in the hot weather i remember the afternoon i put up my cherries last summer she puts the bottle on the big kitchen table center of the room with a sigh is about to sit down in the rocking chair before she is seated realizes what chair it is with a slow look at it steps back the chair which she has touched rocks back and forth mrs peters well i must get those things from the front room closet she goes to the door at the right but after looking into the other room steps back you coming with me mrs hale you could help me carry them they go in the other room reappear mrs peters carrying a dress and skirt mrs hale following with a pair of shoes mrs peters my it s cold in there she puts the clothes on the big table and hurries to the stove mrs hale examining the skirt wright was close i think maybe that s why she kept so much to herself she didn t even belong to the ladies aid i suppose she felt she couldn t do her part and then you don t enjoy things when you feel shabby she used to wear pretty clothes and be lively when she was minnie foster one of the town girls singing in the choir but that oh that was thirty years ago this all you was to take in mrs peters she said she wanted an apron funny thing to want for there isn t much to get you dirty in jail goodness knows but i suppose just to make her feel more natural she said they was in the top drawer in this cupboard yes here and then her little shawl that always hung behind the door opens stair door and looks yes here it is quickly shuts door leading upstairs mrs hale abruptly moving toward her mrs peters mrs peters yes mrs hale mrs hale do you think she did it mrs peters in a frightened voice oh i don t know mrs hale well i don t think she did asking for an apron and her little shawl worrying about her fruit mrs peters starts to speak glances up where footsteps are heard in the room above in a low voice mr peters says it looks bad for her mr henderson is awful sarcastic in a speech and he ll make fun of her sayin she didn t wake up mrs hale well i guess john wright didn t wake when they was slipping that rope under his neck mrs peters no it s strange it must have been done awful crafty and still they say it was such a funny way to kill a man rigging it all up like that mrs hale that s just what mr hale said there was a gun in the house he says that s what he can t understand mrs peters mr henderson said coming out that what was needed for the case was a motive something to show anger or sudden feeling mrs hale who is standing by the table well i don t see any signs of anger around here she puts her hand on the dish towel which lies on the table stands looking down at table one half of which is clean the other half messy it s wiped to here makes a move as if to finish work then turns and looks at loaf of bread outside the breadbox drops towel in that voice of coming back to familiar things wonder how they are finding things upstairs i hope she had it a little more red up up there you know it seems kind of sneaking locking her up in town and then coming out here and trying to get her own house to turn against her mrs peters but mrs hale the law is the law mrs hale i s pose tis unbuttoning her coat better loosen up your things mrs peters you won t feel them when you go out mrs peters takes off her fur tippet goes to hang it on hook at back of room stands looking at the under part of the small corner table mrs peters she was piecing a quilt she brings the large sewing basket and they look at the bright pieces mrs hale it s log cabin pattern pretty isn t it i wonder if she was goin to quilt it or just knot it footsteps have been heard coming down the stairs the sheriff enters followed by hale and the county attorney sheriff they wonder if she was going to quilt it or just knot it the men laugh the women look abashed county attorney rubbing his hands over the stove frank s fire didn t do much up there did it well let s go out to the barn and get that cleared up the men go outside mrs hale resentfully i don t know as there s anything so strange our takin up our time with little things while we re waiting for them to get the evidence she sits down at the big table smoothing out a block with decision i don t see as it s anything to laugh about mrs peters apologetically of course they ve got awful important things on their minds pulls up a chair and joins mrs hale at the table mrs hale examining another block mrs peters look at this one here this is the one she was working on and look at the sewing all the rest of it has been so nice and even and look at this it s all over the place why it looks as if she didn t know what she was about after she has said this they look at each other then start to glance back at the door after an instant mrs hale has pulled at a knot and ripped the sewing mrs peters oh what are you doing mrs hale mrs hale mildly just pulling out a stitch or two that s not sewed very good threading a needle bad sewing always made me fidgety mrs peters nervously i don t think we ought to touch things mrs hale i ll just finish up this end suddenly stopping and leaning forward mrs peters mrs peters yes mrs hale mrs hale what do you suppose she was so nervous about mrs peters oh i don t know i don t know as she was nervous i sometimes sew awful queer when i m just tired mrs hale starts to say something looks at mrs peters then goes on sewing well i must get these things wrapped up they may be through sooner than we think putting apron and other things together i wonder where i can find a piece of paper and string mrs hale in that cupboard maybe mrs peters looking in cupboard why here s a bird cage holds it up did she have a bird mrs hale mrs hale why i don t know whether she did or not i ve not been here for so long there was a man around last year selling canaries cheap but i don t know as she took one maybe she did she used to sing real pretty herself mrs peters glancing around seems funny to think of a bird here but she must have had one or why would she have a cage i wonder what happened to it mrs hale i s pose maybe the cat got it mrs peters no she didn t have a cat she s got that feeling some people have about cats being afraid of them my cat got in her room and she was real upset and asked me to take it out mrs hale my sister bessie was like that queer ain t it mrs peters examining the cage why look at this door it s broke one hinge is pulled apart mrs hale looking too looks as if someone must have been rough with it mrs peters why yes she brings the cage forward and puts it on the table mrs hale i wish if they re going to find any evidence they d be about it i don t like this place mrs peters but i m awful glad you came with me mrs hale it would be lonesome for me sitting here alone mrs hale it would wouldn t it dropping her sewing but i tell you what i do wish mrs peters i wish i had come over sometimes when she was here i looking around the room wish i had mrs peters but of course you were awful busy mrs hale your house and your children mrs hale i could ve come i stayed away because it weren t cheerful and that s why i ought to have come i i ve never liked this place maybe because it s down in a hollow and you don t see the road i dunno what it is but it s a lonesome place and always was i wish i had come over to see minnie foster sometimes i can see now shakes her head mrs peters well you mustn t reproach yourself mrs hale somehow we just don t see how it is with other folks until something comes up mrs hale not having children makes less work but it makes a quiet house and wright out to work all day and no company when he did come in did you know john wright mrs peters mrs peters not to know him i ve seen him in town they say he was a good man mrs hale yes good he didn t drink and kept his word as well as most i guess and paid his debts but he was a hard man mrs peters just to pass the time of day with him shivers like a raw wind that gets to the bone pauses her eye falling on the cage i should think she would a wanted a bird but what do you suppose went with it mrs peters i don t know unless it got sick and died she reaches over and swings the broken door swings it again both women watch it mrs hale you weren t raised round here were you mrs peters shakes her head you didn t know her mrs peters not till they brought her yesterday mrs hale she come to think of it she was kind of like a bird herself real sweet and pretty but kind of timid and fluttery how she did change silence then as if struck by a happy thought and relieved to get back to everyday things tell you what mrs peters why don t you take the quilt in with you it might take up her mind mrs peters why i think that s a real nice idea mrs hale there couldn t possibly be any objection to it could there now just what would i take i wonder if her patches are in here and her things they look in the sewing basket mrs hale here s some red i expect this has got sewing things in it brings out a fancy box what a pretty box looks like something somebody would give you maybe her scissors are in here opens box suddenly puts her hand to her nose why mrs peters bends nearer then turns her face away there s something wrapped up in this piece of silk mrs peters why this isn t her scissors mrs hale lifting the silk oh mrs peters it s mrs peters bends closer mrs peters it s the bird mrs hale jumping up but mrs peters look at it it s neck look at its neck it s all other side to mrs peters somebody wrung its neck their eyes meet a look of growing comprehension of horror steps are heard outside mrs hale slips box under quilt pieces and sinks into her chair enter sheriff and county attorney mrs peters rises county attorney as one turning from serious things to little pleasantries well ladies have you decided whether she was going to quilt it or knot it mrs peters we think she was going to knot it county attorney well that s interesting i m sure seeing the birdcage has the bird flown mrs hale putting more quilt pieces over the box we think the cat got it county attorney preoccupied is there a cat mrs hale glances in a quick covert way at mrs peters mrs peters well not now they re superstitious you know they leave county attorney to sheriff peters continuing an interrupted conversation no sign at all of anyone having come from the outside their own rope now let s go up again and go over it piece by piece they start upstairs it would have to have been someone who knew just the mrs peters sits down the two women sit there not looking at one another but as if peering into something and at the same time holding back when they talk now it is in the manner of feeling their way over strange ground as if afraid of what they are saying but as if they can not help saying it mrs hale she liked the bird she was going to bury it in that pretty box mrs peters in a whisper when i was a girl my kitten there was a boy took a hatchet and before my eyes and before i could get there covers her face an instant if they hadn t held me back i would have catches herself looks upstairs where steps are heard falters weakly hurt him mrs hale with a slow look around her i wonder how it would seem never to have had any children around pause no wright wouldn t like the bird a thing that sang she used to sing he killed that too mrs peters moving uneasily we don t know who killed the bird mrs hale i knew john wright mrs peters it was an awful thing was done in this house that night mrs hale killing a man while he slept slipping a rope around his neck that choked the life out of him mrs hale his neck choked the life out of him her hand goes out and rests on the bird cage mrs peters with rising voice we don t know who killed him we don t know mrs hale her own feeling not interrupted if there d been years and years of nothing then a bird to sing to you it would be awful still after the bird was still mrs peters something within her speaking i know what stillness is when we homesteaded in dakota and my first baby died after he was two years old and me with no other then mrs hale moving how soon do you suppose they ll be through looking for the evidence mrs peters i know what stillness is pulling herself back the law has got to punish crime mrs hale mrs hale not as if answering that i wish you d seen minnie foster when she wore a white dress with blue ribbons and stood up there in the choir and sang a look around the room oh i wish i d come over here once in a while that was a crime that was a crime who s going to punish that mrs peters looking upstairs we mustn t take on mrs hale i might have known she needed help i know how things can be for women i tell you it s queer mrs peters we live close together and we live far apart we all go through the same things it s all just a different kind of the same thing brushes her eyes noticing the bottle of fruit reaches out for it if i was you i wouldn t tell her her fruit was gone tell her it ain t tell her it s all right take this in to prove it to her she she may never know whether it was broke or not mrs peters takes the bottle looks about for something to wrap it in takes petticoat from the clothes brought from the other room very nervously begins winding this around the bottle in a false voice my it s a good thing the men couldn t hear us wouldn t they just laugh getting all stirred up over a little thing like a dead canary as if that could have anything to do with with wouldn t they laugh the men are heard coming down stairs mrs hale under her breath maybe they would maybe they wouldn t county attorney no peters it s all perfectly clear except a reason for doing it but you know juries when it comes to women if there was some definite thing something to show something to make a story about a thing that would connect up with this strange way of doing it the women s eyes meet for an instant enter hale from outer door hale well i ve got the team around pretty cold out there county attorney i m going to stay here a while by myself to the sheriff you can send frank out for me can t you i want to go over everything i m not satisfied that we can t do better sheriff do you want to see what mrs peters is going to take in the lawyer goes to the table picks up the apron laughs county attorney oh i guess they re not very dangerous things the ladies have picked out moves a few things about disturbing the quilt pieces which cover the box steps back no mrs peters doesn t need supervising for that matter a sheriff s wife is married to the law ever think of it that way mrs peters mrs peters not just that way sheriff chuckling married to the law moves toward the other room i just want you to come in here a minute george we ought to take a look at these windows county attorney scoffingly oh windows sheriff we ll be right out mr hale hale goes outside the sheriff follows the county attorney into the other room then mrs hale rises hands tight together looking intensely at mrs peters whose eyes make a slow turn finally meeting mrs hale s a moment mrs hale holds her then her own eyes point the way to where the box is concealed suddenly mrs peters throws back quilt pieces and tries to put the box in the bag she is wearing it is too big she opens box starts to take bird out can not touch it goes to pieces stands there helpless sound of a knob turning in the other room mrs hale snatches the box and puts it in the pocket of her big coat enter county attorney and sheriff county attorney facetiously well henry at least we found out that she was not going to quilt it she was going to what is it you call it ladies mrs hale her hand against her pocket we call it knot it mr henderson curtain the outside first performed by the provincetown players at the playwrights theatre december captain of the bars life saving station bradford a life saver tony a portuguese life saver mrs patrick who lives in the abandoned station allie mayo who works for her scene a room in a house which was once a life saving station since ceasing to be that it has taken on no other character except that of a place which no one cares either to preserve or change it is painted the life saving grey but has not the life saving freshness this is one end of what was the big boat room and at the ceiling is seen a part of the frame work from which the boat once swung about two thirds of the back wall is open because of the big sliding door of the type of barn door and through this open door are seen the sand dunes and beyond them the woods at one point the line where woods and dunes meet stands out clearly and there are indicated the rude things vines bushes which form the outer uneven rim of the woods the only things that grow in the sand at another point a sand hill is menacing the woods this old life saving station is at a point where the sea curves so through the open door the sea also is seen the station is located on the outside shore of cape cod at the point near the tip of the cape where it makes that final curve which forms the provincetown harbor the dunes are hills and strange forms of sand on which in places grows the stiff beach grass struggle dogged growing against odds at right of the big sliding door is a drift of sand and the top of buried beach grass is seen on this there is a door left and at right of big sliding door is a slanting wall door in this is ajar at rise of curtain and through this door bradford and tony life savers are seen bending over a man s body attempting to restore respiration the captain of the life savers comes into view outside the big open door at left he appears to have been hurrying peers in sees the men goes quickly to them captain i ll take this now boys bradford no need for anybody to take it capt n he was dead when we picked him up captain dannie sears was dead when we picked him up but we brought him back i ll go on awhile the two men who have been bending over the body rise stretch to relax and come into the room bradford pushing back his arms and putting his hands on his chest work tryin to put life in the dead captain where d you find him joe bradford in front of this house not forty feet out captain what d you bring him up here for he speaks in an abstracted way as if the working part of his mind is on something else and in the muffled voice of one bending over bradford with a sheepish little laugh force of habit i guess we brought so many of em back up here looks around the room and then it was kind of unfriendly down where he was the wind spittin the sea onto you till he d have no way of knowin he was ashore tony lucky i was not sooner or later as i walk by from my watch bradford you have accommodating ways tony no sooner or later i wouldn t say it of many portagees but the sea calling it in to the captain is friendly as a kitten alongside the women that live here allie mayo they re both crazy had that door open moving his head toward the big sliding door sweepin out and when we come along she backs off and stands lookin at us lookin lord i just wanted to get him somewhere else so i kicked this door open with my foot jerking his hand toward the room where the captain is seen bending over the man and got him away under his voice if he did have any notion of comin back to life he wouldn t a come if he d seen her more genially i wouldn t captain you know who he is joe bradford i never saw him before captain mitchell telephoned from high head that a dory came ashore there bradford last night wasn t the best night for a dory to tony boastfully not that i couldn t a stayed in one some men can stay in a dory and some can t going to the inner door that boy s dead capt n captain then i m not doing him any harm bradford going over and shaking the frame where the boat once swung this the first time you ever been in this place ain t it tony tony i never was here before bradford well i was here before a laugh and the old man nodding toward the captain he lived here for twenty seven years lord the things that happened here there ve been dead ones carried through that door pointing to the outside door lord the ones i ve carried i carried in bill collins and lou harvey and huh sall over now you ain t seen no wrecks don t ever think you have i was here the night the jennie snow was out there pointing to the sea there was a wreck we got the boat that stood here again shaking the frame down that bank goes to the door and looks out lord how d we ever do it the sand has put his place on the blink all right and then when it gets too god for saken for a life savin station a lady takes it for a summer residence and then spends the winter she s a cheerful one tony a woman she makes things pretty this not like a place where a woman live on the floor there is nothing on the wall there is nothing things trying to express it with his hands do not hang on other things bradford imitating tony s gesture no things do not hang on other things in my opinion the woman s crazy sittin over there on the sand a gesture towards the dunes what s she lookin at there ain t nothin to see and i know the woman that works for her s crazy allie mayo she s a provincetown girl she was all right once but mrs patrick comes in from the hall at the right she is a city woman a sophisticated person who has been caught into something as unlike the old life as the dunes are unlike a meadow at the moment she is excited and angry mrs patrick you have no right here this isn t the life saving station any more just because it used to be i don t see why you should think this is my house and i want my house to myself captain putting his head through the door one arm of the man he is working with is raised and the hand reaches through the doorway well i must say lady i would think that any house could be a life saving station when the sea had sent a man to it mrs patrick who has turned away so she can not see the hand i don t want him here i defiant yet choking i must have my house to myself captain you ll get your house to yourself when i ve made up my mind there s no more life in this man a good many lives have been saved in this house mrs patrick i believe that s your name and if there s any chance of bringing one more back from the dead the fact that you own the house ain t goin to make a damn bit of difference to me mrs patrick in a thin wild way i must have my house to myself captain hell with such a woman moves the man he is working with and slams the door shut as the captain says and if there s any chance of bringing one more back from the dead allie mayo has appeared outside the wide door which gives on to the dunes a bleak woman who at first seems little more than a part of the sand before which she stands but as she listens to this conflict one suspects in her that peculiar intensity of twisted things which grow in unfavoring places mrs patrick i i don t want them here i must but suddenly she retreats and is gone bradford well i couldn t say allie mayo that you work for any too kind hearted a lady what s the matter with the woman does she want folks to die appears to break her all up to see somebody trying to save a life what d you work for such a fish for a crazy fish that s what i call the woman i ve seen her day after day settin over there where the dunes meet the woods just sittin there lookin suddenly thinking of it i believe she likes to see the sand slippin down on the woods pleases her to see somethin gettin buried i guess allie mayo who has stepped inside the door and moved half across the room toward the corridor at the right is arrested by this last stands a moment as if seeing through something then slowly on and out bradford some coffee d taste good but coffee in this house oh no it might make somebody feel better opening the door that was slammed shut want me now capt n captain no bradford oh that boy s dead capt n captain snarling dannie sears was dead too shut that door i don t want to hear that woman s voice again ever closing the door and sitting on a bench built into that corner between the big sliding door and the room where the captain is bradford they re a cheerful pair of women livin in this cheerful place a place that life savers had to turn over to the sand huh this patrick woman used to be all right she and her husband was summer folks over in town they used to picnic over here on the outside it was joe dyer he s always talkin to summer folks told em the government was goin to build the new station and sell this one by sealed bids i heard them talkin about it they was sittin right down there on the beach eatin their supper they was goin to put in a fire place and they was goin to paint it bright colors and have parties over here summer folk notions their bid won it who d want it a buried house you couldn t move tony i see no bright colors bradford don t you how astonishin you must be color blind and i guess we re the first party laughs i was in bill joseph s grocery store one day last november when in she comes mrs patrick from new york i ve come to take the old life saving station says she i m going to sleep over there tonight huh bill is used to queer ways he deals with summer folks but that got him november an empty house a buried house you might say off here on the outside shore way across the sand from man or beast he got it out of her not by what she said but by the way she looked at what he said that her husband had died and she was runnin off to hide herself i guess a person d feel sorry for her if she weren t so stand offish and so doggon mean but mean folks have got minds of their own she slept here that night bill had men hauling things till after dark bed stove coal and then she wanted somebody to work for her somebody says she that doesn t say an unnecessary word well then bill come to the back of the store i said looks to me as if allie mayo was the party she s lookin for allie mayo has got a prejudice against words or maybe she likes em so well she s savin of em she s not spoke an unnecessary word for twenty years she s got her reasons women whose men go to sea ain t always talkative the captain comes out he closes door behind him and stands there beside it he looks tired and disappointed both look at him pause captain wonder who he was bradford young guess he s not been much at sea captain i hate to leave even the dead in this house but we can get right back for him a look around the old place used to be more friendly moves to outer door hesitates hating to leave like this well joe we brought a good many of them back here bradford dannie sears is tendin bar in boston now the three men go as they are going around the drift of sand allie mayo comes in carrying a pot of coffee sees them leaving puts down the coffee pot looks at the door the captain has closed moves toward it as if drawn mrs patrick follows her in mrs patrick they ve gone mrs mayo nods facing the closed door mrs patrick and they re leaving him again the other woman nods then he s mrs mayo just stands there they have no right just because it used to be their place i want my house to myself snatches her coat and scarf from a hook and starts through the big door toward the dunes allie mayo wait when she has said it she sinks into that corner seat as if overwhelmed by what she has done the other woman is held allie mayo to herself if i could say that i can say more looking at woman she has arrested but speaking more to herself that boy in there his face uncovered something her open hand on her chest but she waits as if she can not go on when she speaks it is in labored way slow monotonous as if snowed in by silent years for twenty years i did what you are doing and i can tell you it s not the way her voice has fallen to a whisper she stops looking ahead at something remote and veiled we had been married two years a start as of sudden pain says it again as if to make herself say it married two years he had a chance to go north on a whaler times hard he had to go a year and a half it was to be a year and a half two years we d been married she sits silent moving a little back and forth the day he went away not spoken but breathed from pain the days after he was gone i heard at first last letter said farther north not another chance to write till on the way home a wait six months another i did not hear long wait nobody ever heard after it seems she is held there and will not go on i used to talk as much as any girl in provincetown jim used to tease me about my talking but they d come in to talk to me they d say you may hear yet they d talk about what must have happened and one day a woman who d been my friend all my life said suppose he was to walk in i got up and drove her from my kitchen and from that time till this i ve not said a word i didn t have to say she has become almost wild in telling this that passes in a whisper the ice that caught jim caught me a moment as if held in ice comes from it to mrs patrick simply it s not the way a sudden change you re not the only woman in the world whose husband is dead mrs patrick with a cry of the hurt dead my husband s not dead allie mayo he s not slowly understands oh the woman in the door is crying suddenly picks up her coat which has fallen to the floor and steps outside allie mayo almost failing to do it wait mrs patrick wait don t you think you ve said enough they told me you didn t say an unnecessary word allie mayo i don t mrs patrick and you can see i should think that you ve bungled into things you know nothing about as she speaks and crying under her breath she pushes the sand by the door down on the half buried grass though not as if knowing what she is doing allie mayo slowly when you keep still for twenty years you know things you didn t know you knew i know why you re doing that she looks up at her startled don t bury the only thing that will grow let it grow the woman outside still crying under her breath turns abruptly and starts toward the line where dunes and woods meet allie mayo i know where you re going mrs patrick turns but not as if she wants to what you ll try to do over there pointing to the line of woods bury it the life in you bury it watching the sand bury the woods but i ll tell you something they fight too the woods they fight for life the way that captain fought for life in there pointing to the closed door mrs patrick with a strange exultation and lose the way he lost in there allie mayo sure sombre they don t lose mrs patrick don t lose triumphant i have walked on the tops of buried trees allie mayo slow sombre yet large and vines will grow over the sand that covers the trees and hold it and other trees will grow over the buried trees mrs patrick i ve watched the sand slip down on the vines that reach out farthest allie mayo another vine will reach that spot under her breath tenderly strange little things that reach out farthest mrs patrick and will be buried soonest allie mayo and hold the sand for things behind them they save a wood that guards a town mrs patrick i care nothing about a wood to guard a town this is the outside these dunes where only beach grass grows this outer shore where men can t live the outside you who were born here and who die here have named it that allie mayo yes we named it that and we had reason he died here reaches her hand toward the closed door and many a one before him but many another reached the harbor slowly raises her arm bends it to make the form of the cape touches the outside of her bent arm the outside but an arm that bends to make a harbor where men are safe mrs patrick i m outside the harbor on the dunes land not life allie mayo dunes meet woods and woods hold dunes from a town that s shore to a harbor mrs patrick this is the outside sand picking some of it up in her hand and letting it fall on the beach grass sand that covers hills of sand that move and cover allie mayo woods woods to hold the moving hills from provincetown provincetown where they turn when boats can t live at sea did you ever see the sails come round here when the sky is dark a line of them swift to the harbor where their children live go back pointing back to your edge of the woods that s the edge of the dunes mrs patrick the edge of life where life trails off to dwarfed things not worth a name suddenly sits down in the doorway allie mayo not worth a name and meeting the outside big with the sense of the wonder of life mrs patrick lifting sand and letting it drift through her hand they re what the sand will let them be they take strange shapes like shapes of blown sand allie mayo meeting the outside moving nearer speaking more personally i know why you came here to this house that had been given up on this shore where only savers of life try to live i know what holds you on these dunes and draws you over there but other things are true beside the things you want to see mrs patrick how do you know they are where have you been for twenty years allie mayo outside twenty years that s why i know how brave they are indicating the edge of the woods suddenly different you ll not find peace there again go back and watch them fight mrs patrick swiftly rising you re a cruel woman a hard insolent woman i knew what i was doing what do you know about it about me i didn t go to the outside i was left there i m only trying to get along everything that can hurt me i want buried buried deep spring is here this morning i knew it spring coming through the storm to take me take me to hurt me that s why i couldn t bear she looks at the closed door things that made me know i feel you haven t felt for so long you don t know what it means but i tell you spring is here and now you d take that from me looking now toward the edge of the woods the thing that made me know they would be buried in my heart those things i can t live and know i feel you re more cruel than the sea but other things are true beside the things you want to see outside springs will come when i will not know that it is spring as if resentful of not more deeply believing what she says what would there be for me but the outside what was there for you what did you ever find after you lost the thing you wanted allie mayo i found what i find now i know the edge of life to hold life behind me a slight gesture toward mrs patrick mrs patrick stepping back you call what you are life laughs bleak as those ugly things that grow in the sand allie mayo under her breath as one who speaks tenderly of beauty ugly mrs patrick passionately i have known life i have known life you re like this cape a line of land way out to sea land not life allie mayo a harbor far at sea raises her arm curves it in as if around something she loves land that encloses and gives shelter from storm mrs patrick facing the sea as if affirming what will hold all else out outside sea outer shore dunes land not life allie mayo outside sea outer shore dark with the wood that once was ships dunes strange land not life woods town and harbor the line stunted straggly line that meets the outside face to face and fights for what itself can never be lonely line brave growing mrs patrick it loses allie mayo it wins mrs patrick the farthest life is buried allie mayo and life grows over buried life lifted into that then as one who states a simple truth with feeling it will and springs will come when you will want to know that it is spring the captain and bradford appear behind the drift of sand they have a stretcher to get away from them mrs patrick steps farther into the room allie mayo shrinks into her corner the men come in open the closed door and go in the room where they left the dead man a moment later they are seen outside the big open door bearing the man away mrs patrick watches them from sight mrs patrick bitter exultant savers of life to allie mayo you savers of life meeting the outside meeting but she can not say it mockingly again in saying it something of what it means has broken through rises herself lost feeling her way into the wonder of life meeting the outside it grows in her as curtain lowers slowly the verge first performed at the provincetown playhouse on november persons of the play anthony harry archer claire s husband hattie the maid claire dick richard demming tom edgeworthy elizabeth claire s daughter adelaide claire s sister dr emmons act i the curtain lifts on a place that is dark save for a shaft of light from below which comes up through an open trap door in the floor this slants up and strikes the long leaves and the huge brilliant blossom of a strange plant whose twisted stem projects from right front nothing is seen except this plant and its shadow a violent wind is heard a moment later a buzzer it buzzes once long and three short silence again the buzzer then from below his shadow blocking the light comes anthony a rugged man past middle life he emerges from the stairway into the darkness of the room is dimly seen taking up a phone anthony yes miss claire i ll see he brings a thermometer to the stairway for light looks sharply then returns to the phone it s down to forty nine the plants are in danger with great relief and approval oh that s fine hangs up the receiver fine he goes back down the stairway closing the trap door upon himself and the curtain is drawn upon darkness and wind it opens a moment later on the greenhouse in the sunshine of a snowy morning the snow piled outside is at times blown through the air the frost has made patterns on the glass as if as plato would have it the patterns inherent in abstract nature and behind all life had to come out not only in the creative heat within but in the creative cold on the other side of the glass and the wind makes patterns of sound around the glass house the back wall is low the glass roof slopes sharply up there is an outside door a little toward the right from outside two steps lead down to it at left a glass partition and a door into the inner room one sees a little way into this room at right there is no dividing wall save large plants and vines a narrow aisle between shelves of plants leads off this is not a greenhouse where plants are being displayed nor the usual workshop for the growing of them but a place for experiment with plants a laboratory at the back grows a strange vine it is arresting rather than beautiful it creeps along the low wall and one branch gets a little way up the glass you might see the form of a cross in it if you happened to think it that way the leaves of this vine are not the form that leaves have been they are at once repellent and significant anthony is at work preparing soil mixing sifting as the wind tries the door he goes anxiously to the thermometer nods as if reassured and returns to his work the buzzer sounds he starts to answer the telephone remembers something halts and listens sharply it does not buzz once long and three short then he returns to his work the buzzer goes on and on in impatient jerks which mount in anger several times anthony is almost compelled by this insistence but the thing that holds him back is stronger at last after a particularly mad splutter to which anthony longs to make retort the buzzer gives it up anthony goes on preparing soil a moment later the glass door swings violently in snow blowing in and also mr harry archer wrapped in a rug anthony oh please close the door sir harry do you think i m not trying to he holds it open to say this anthony but please do this stormy air is not good for the plants harry i suppose it s just the thing for me now what do you mean anthony by not answering the phone when i buzz for you anthony miss claire mrs archer told me not to harry told you not to answer me anthony not you especially nobody but her harry well i like her nerve and yours anthony you see she thought it took my mind from my work to be interrupted when i m out here and so it does so she buzzes once long and well she buzzes her way and all other buzzing harry may buzz anthony nodding gravely she thought it would be better for the flowers harry i am not a flower true but i too need a little attention and a little heat will you please tell me why the house is frigid anthony miss claire ordered all the heat turned out here patiently explaining it to miss claire s speechless husband you see the roses need a great deal of heat harry reading the thermometer the roses have seventy three i have forty five anthony yes the roses need seventy three harry anthony this is an outrage anthony i think it is myself when you consider what we paid for the heating plant but as long as it is defective why miss claire would never have done what she has if she hadn t looked out for her plants in just such ways as this have you forgotten that breath of life is about to flower harry and where s my breakfast about to flower that s what i want to know anthony why miss claire got up at five o clock to order the heat turned off from the house harry i see you admire her vigilance anthony oh i do fervently i do harm was near and that woke her up harry and what about the harm to tapping his chest do roses get pneumonia anthony oh yes yes indeed they do why mr archer look at miss claire herself hasn t she given her heat to the roses harry pulling the rug around him preparing for the blizzard she has the fire within anthony delighted now isn t that true how well you said it with a glare for this appreciation harry opens the door it blows away from him please do close the door harry furiously you think it is the aim of my life to hold it open anthony getting hold of it growing things need an even temperature while saying this he gets the man out into the snow anthony consults the thermometer not as pleased this time as he was before he then looks minutely at two of the plants one is a rose the other a flower without a name because it has not long enough been a flower peers into the hearts of them then from a drawer under a shelf takes two paper bags puts one over each of these flowers closing them down at the bottom again the door blows wildly in also hattie a maid with a basket anthony what do you mean blowing in here like this mrs archer has ordered hattie mr archer has ordered breakfast served here she uncovers the basket and takes out an electric toaster anthony breakfast here eat here where plants grow hattie the plants won t poison him will they at a loss to know what to do with things she puts the toaster under the strange vine at the back whose leaves lift up against the glass which has frost leaves on the outer side anthony snatching it away you you think you can cook eggs under the edge vine hattie i guess mr archer s eggs are as important as a vine i guess my work s as important as yours anthony there s a million people like you and like mr archer in all the world there is only one edge vine hattie well maybe one s enough it don t look like nothin anyhow anthony and you ve not got the wit to know that that s why it s the edge vine hattie you want to look out anthony you talk nutty everybody says so anthony miss claire don t say so hattie no because she s anthony you talk too much door opens admitting harry after looking around for the best place to eat breakfast moves a box of earth from the table harry just give me a hand will you hattie they bring it to the open space and he and hattie arrange breakfast things hattie with triumphant glances at the distressed anthony anthony deciding he must act mr archer this is not the place to eat breakfast harry dead wrong old boy the place that has heat is the place to eat breakfast to hattie tell the other gentlemen i heard mr demming up and mr edgeworthy if he appears that as long as it is such a pleasant morning we re having breakfast outside to the conservatory for coffee hattie giggles is leaving and let s see have we got everything takes the one shaker shakes a little pepper on his hand looks in vain for the other shaker and tell mr demming to bring the salt anthony but miss claire will be very angry harry i am very angry did i choose to eat my breakfast at the other end of a blizzard anthony an exclamation of horror at the thermometer the temperature is falling i must report he punches the buzzer takes up the phone miss claire it is anthony a terrible thing has happened mr archer what yes a terrible thing yes it is about mr archer no no not dead but here he is here yes he is well he seems well but he is eating his breakfast yes he is having breakfast served out here for himself and the other gentlemen are to come too well he seemed to be annoyed because the heat had been turned off from the house but the door keeps opening this stormy wind blowing right over the plants the temperature has already fallen yes yes i thought you would want to come anthony opens the trap door and goes below harry looks disapprovingly down into this openness at his feet returns to his breakfast anthony comes up bearing a box harry turning his face away phew what a smell anthony yes fertilizer has to smell harry well it doesn t have to smell up my breakfast anthony with a patient sense of order the smell belongs here he and the smell go to the inner room the outer door opens just enough to admit claire is quickly closed with claire in a room another kind of aliveness is there claire what are you doing here harry getting breakfast all the while doing so claire i ll not have you in my place harry if you take all the heat then you have to take me claire i ll show you how i have to take you with her hands begins scooping upon him the soil anthony has prepared harry jumping up laughing pinning down her arms putting his arms around her claire be decent what harm do i do here claire you pull down the temperature harry not after i m in claire and you told tom and dick to come and make it uneven harry tom and dick are our guests we can t eat where it s warm and leave them to eat where it s cold claire i don t see why not harry you only see what you want to see claire that s not true i wish it were no no i don t either she is disturbed that troubled thing which rises from within from deep and takes claire she turns to the edge vine examines regretfully to anthony who has come in with a plant it s turning back isn t it anthony can you be sure yet miss claire claire oh yes it s had its chance it doesn t want to be what hasn t been harry who has turned at this note in her voice speaks kindly don t take it so seriously claire claire laughs claire no i suppose not but it does matter and why should i pretend it doesn t just because i ve failed with it harry well i don t want to see it get you it s not important enough for that claire in her brooding way anything is important enough for that if it s important at all to the vine i thought you were out but you re going back home anthony but you re doing it this time miss claire when breath of life opens and we see its heart claire looks toward the inner room because of intervening plants they do not see what is seen from the front a plant like caught motion and of a greater transparency than plants have had its leaves like waves that curl close around a heart that is not seen this plant stands by itself in what because of the arrangement of things about it is a hidden place but nothing is between it and the light claire yes if the heart has a little laugh held its own then breath of life is alive in its otherness but edge vine is running back to what it broke out of harry come have some coffee claire anthony returns to the inner room the outer door opens dick is hurled in claire going to the door as he gasps for breath before closing it how dare you make my temperature uneven she shuts the door and leans against it dick is that what i do a laugh a look between them which is held into significance harry who is not facing them where s the salt dick oh i fell down in the snow i must have left the salt where i fell i ll go back and look for it claire and change the temperature we don t need salt harry you don t need salt claire but we eat eggs claire i must tell you i don t like the idea of any food being eaten here where things have their own way to go please eat as little as possible and as quickly harry a hostess calculated to put one at one s ease claire with no ill nature i care nothing about your ease or about dick s ease dick and no doubt that s what makes you so fascinating a hostess claire was i a fascinating hostess last night dick softly sings oh night of love from the barcorole of tales of hoffman harry we ve got to have salt he starts for the door claire slips in ahead of him locks it takes the key he marches off right claire calling after him that end s always locked dick claire darling i wish you wouldn t say those startling things you do get away with it but i confess it gives me a shock and really it s unwise claire haven t you learned that the best place to hide is in the truth as harry returns why won t you believe me harry when i tell you the truth about doors being locked harry claire it s selfish of you to keep us from eating salt just because you don t eat salt claire with one of her swift changes oh harry try your egg without salt please please try it without salt an intensity which seems all out of proportion to the subject harry an egg demands salt claire an egg demands salt do you know harry why you are such an unseasoned person an egg demands salt harry well it doesn t always get it claire but your spirit gets no lift from the salt withheld harry not an inch of lift going back to his breakfast claire and pleased so pleased with itself for getting no lift sure it is just the right kind of spirit because it gets no lift more brightly but dick you must have tried your egg without salt dick i ll try it now he goes to the breakfast table claire you must have tried and tried things isn t that the way one leaves the normal and gets into the byways of perversion harry claire dick pushing back his egg if so i prefer to wait for the salt harry claire there is a limit claire precisely what i had in mind to perversion too there is a limit so the fortifications are unassailable if one ever does get out i suppose it is quite unexpectedly and perhaps a bit terribly harry get out where claire with a bright smile where you darling will never go harry and from which you darling had better beat it claire i wish i could to herself no no i don t either again this troubled thing turns her to the plant she puts by themselves the two which anthony covered with paper bags is about to remove these papers harry strikes a match claire turning sharply you can t smoke here the plants are not used to it harry then i should think smoking would be just the thing for them claire there is design harry to dick am i supposed to be answered i never can be quite sure at what moment i am answered they both watch claire who has uncovered the plants and is looking intently into the flowers from a drawer she takes some tools very carefully gives the rose pollen to an unfamiliar flower rather wistfully unfamiliar which stands above on a small shelf near the door of the inner room dick what is this you re doing claire claire pollenizing crossing for fragrance dick it s all rather mysterious isn t it harry and claire doesn t make it any less so claire can i make life any less mysterious harry if you know what you are doing why can t you tell dick dick never mind after all why should i be told he turns away at that she wants to tell him helpless as one who can not get across a stream starts uncertainly claire i want to give fragrance to breath of life faces the room beyond the wall of glass the flower i have created that is outside what flowers have been what has gone out should bring fragrance from what it has left but no definite fragrance no limiting enclosing thing i call the fragrance i am trying to create reminiscence her hand on the pot of the wistful little flower she has just given pollen reminiscent of the rose the violet arbutus but a new thing itself breath of life may be lonely out in what hasn t been perhaps some day i can give it reminiscence dick i see claire claire i wonder if you do harry now claire you re going to be gay to day aren t you these are tom s last couple of days with us claire that doesn t make me especially gay harry well you want him to remember you as yourself don t you claire i would like him to oh i would like him to harry then be amusing that s really you isn t it dick dick not quite all of her i should say claire gaily careful dick aren t you indiscreet harry will be suspecting that i am your latest strumpet harry claire what language you use a person knowing you only by certain moments could never be made to believe you are a refined woman claire true isn t it dick harry it would be a good deal of a lark to let them listen in at times then tell them that here is the flower of new england claire well if this is the flower of new england then the half has never been told dick about new england claire i thought i meant that perhaps i meant about me harry going on with his own entertainment explain that this is what came of the men who made the laws that made new england that here is the flower of those gentlemen of culture who dick moulded the american mind claire oh it is pain harry now what s the matter claire i want to get away from them harry rest easy little one you do claire i m not so sure that i do but it can be done we need not be held in forms moulded for us there is outness and otherness harry now claire i didn t mean to start anything serious claire no you never mean to do that i want to break it up i tell you i want to break it up if it were all in pieces we d be a little laugh shocked to aliveness to dick wouldn t we there would be strange new comings together mad new comings together and we would know what it is to be born and then we might know that we are smash it her hand is near an egg as you d smash an egg she pushes the egg over the edge of the table and leans over and looks as over a precipice harry with a sigh well all you ve smashed is the egg and all that amounts to is that now tom gets no egg so that s that claire with difficulty drawing herself back from the fascination of the precipice you think i can t smash anything you think life can t break up and go outside what it was because you ve gone dead in the form in which you found yourself you think that s all there is to the whole adventure and that is called sanity and made a virtue to lock one in you never worked with things that grow things that take a sporting chance go mad that sanity mayn t lock them in from life untouched from life that waits she turns toward the inner room breath of life she goes in there harry oh i wish claire wouldn t be strange like that helplessly what is it what s the matter dick it s merely the excess of a particularly rich temperament harry but it s growing on her i sometimes wonder if all this indicating the place around him is a good thing it would be all right if she d just do what she did in the beginning make the flowers as good as possible of their kind that s an awfully nice thing for a woman to do raise flowers but there s something about this changing things into other things putting things together and making queer new things this dick creating harry give it any name you want it to have it s unsettling for a woman they say claire s a shark at it but what s the good of it if it gets her what is the good of it anyway suppose we can produce new things lord look at the one ones we ve got looks outside turns back heavens what a noise the wind does make around this place but now it is not all the wind but tom edgeworthy who is trying to let himself in at the locked door their backs are to him i want my egg you can t eat an egg without salt i must say i don t get claire lately i d like to have charlie emmons see her he s fixed up a lot of people shot to pieces in the war claire needs something to tone her nerves up you think it would irritate her dick she d probably get no little entertainment out of it harry yes dog gone her she would tom now takes more heroic measures to make himself heard at the door funny how the wind can fool you now by not looking around i could imagine why i could imagine anything funny isn t it about imagination and claire says i haven t got any dick it would make an amusing drawing what the wind makes you think is there first makes forms with his hands then levelling the soil prepared by anthony traces lines with his finger yes really quite jolly tom after a moment of peering in at them smiles goes away harry you re another one of the queer ducks aren t you come now give me the dirt have you queer ones really got anything or do you just put it over on us that you have dick smiles draws on not saying anything eh well i guess you re wise there if you keep mum how are we going to prove there s nothing there dick i don t keep mum i draw harry lines that don t make anything how can they tell you anything well all i ask is don t make claire queer claire s a first water good sport really so don t encourage her to be queer dick trouble is if you re queer enough to be amusing it might open the door to queerness harry now don t say things like that to claire dick i don t have to harry then you think she s queer do you queer as you are you think she s queer i would like to have dr emmons come out after a moment of silently watching dick who is having a good time with his drawing you know frankly i doubt if you re a good influence for claire dick lifts his head ever so slightly oh i don t worry a bit about things a husband might worry about i suppose an intellectual woman and for all claire s hate of her ancestors she s got the bug herself why she has times of boring into things until she doesn t know you re there what do you think i caught her doing the other day reading latin well a woman that reads latin needn t worry a husband much dick they said a good deal in latin harry but i was saying i suppose a woman who lives a good deal in her mind never does have much well what you might call passion uses the word as if it shouldn t be used brows knitted is looking ahead does not see dick s face turning to him with a laugh i suppose you know pretty much all there is to know about women dick perhaps one or two details have escaped me harry well for that matter you might know all there is to know about women and not know much about claire but now about does not want to say passion again oh feeling claire has a certain well a certain dick irony harry which is really more more dick more fetching perhaps harry yes than the thing itself but of course you wouldn t have much of a thing that you have irony about dick oh wouldn t you i mean a man might harry i d like to talk to edgeworth about claire but it s not easy to talk to tom about claire or to claire about tom dick alert they re very old friends aren t they harry why yes they are though they ve not been together much of late years edgeworthy always going to the ends of the earth to meditate about something i must say i don t get it if you have a place that s the place for you to be and he did have a place best kind of family connections and it was a very good business his father left him publishing business in good shape too when old edgeworthy died i wouldn t call tom a great success in life but claire does listen to what he says dick yes i ve noticed that harry so i d like to get him to tell her to quit this queer business of making things grow that never grew before dick but are you sure that s what he would tell her isn t he in the same business himself harry why he doesn t raise anything tom is again at the door dick anyway i think he might have some idea that we can t very well reach each other harry damn nonsense what have we got intelligence for dick to let each other alone i suppose only we haven t enough to do it tom is now knocking on the door with a revolver harry half turns decides to be too intelligent to turn harry don t tell me i m getting nerves but the way some of you people talk is enough to make even an aviator jumpy can t reach each other then we re fools if i m here and you re there why can t we reach each other dick because i am i and you are you harry no wonder your drawing s queer a man who can t reach another man tom here reaches them by pointing the revolver in the air and firing it dick digs his hand into the dirt harry jumps to one side fearfully looks around tom with a pleased smile to see he at last has their attention moves the handle to indicate he would be glad to come in harry why it s tom what the going to the door he s locked out and claire s got the key goes to the inner door tries it and she s locked in trying to see her in there claire claire returning to the outer door claire s got the key and i can t get to claire makes a futile attempt at getting the door open without a key goes back to inner door peers pounds claire are you there didn t you hear the revolver has she gone down the cellar tries the trap door bolted well i love the way she keeps people locked out dick and in harry getting angry shouting at the trap door didn t you hear the revolver going to tom awfully sorry old man but in astonishment to dick he can t hear me tom knocking with the revolver to get their attention makes a gesture of inquiry with it no no no is he asking if he shall shoot himself shaking his head violently oh no no um um dick hardly seems a man would shoot himself because he can t get to his breakfast harry i m coming to believe people would do anything tom is making another inquiry with the revolver no not here don t shoot yourself trying hard to get the word through shoot yourself i mean don t petulantly to dick it s ridiculous that you can t make a man understand you when he looks right at you like that turning back to tom read my lips lips i m saying oh damn where is claire all right i ll explain it with motions we wanted the salt going over it to himself and claire wouldn t let us go out for it on account of the temperature salt temperature takes his egg cup to the door violent motion of shaking in salt but no shakes his head no salt he then takes the thermometer a flower pot holds them up to tom on account of the temperature tem per a tom is not getting it oh well what can you do when a man don t get a thing tom seems to be preparing the revolver for action harry pounds on the inner door claire do you want tom to shoot himself as he looks in there the trap door lifts and claire comes half way up claire why what is tom doing out there with a revolver harry he is about to shoot himself because you ve locked him out from his breakfast claire he must know more interesting ways of destroying himself bowing to tom good morning from his side of the glass tom bows and smiles back isn t it strange our being in here and he being out there harry claire have you no ideas of hospitality let him in claire in perhaps that isn t hospitality harry well whatever hospitality is what is out there is snow and wind and our guest who was asked to come here for his breakfast to think a man has to such things claire i m going to let him in though i like his looks out there she takes the key from her pocket harry thank heaven the door s coming open somebody can go for salt and we can have our eggs claire and open the door again to let the salt in no if you insist on salt tell tom now to go back and get it it s a stormy morning and there ll be just one opening of the door harry how can we tell him what we can t make him hear and why does he think we re holding this conversation instead of letting him in claire it would be interesting to know i wonder if he ll tell us harry claire is this any time to wonder anything claire give up the idea of salt for your egg and i ll let him in holds up the key to tom to indicate that for her part she is quite ready to let him in harry i want my egg claire then ask him to bring the salt it s quite simple harry goes through another pantomime with the egg cup and the missing shaker claire still standing half way down cellar sneezes harry growing all the while less amiable explains with thermometer and flower pot that there can only be one opening of the door tom looks interested but unenlightened but suddenly he smiles nods vanishes harry well thank heaven exhausted that s over claire sitting on the top step it was all so queer he locked out on his side of the door you locked in on yours looking right at each other and harry in mockery and me trying to tell him to kindly fetch the salt claire yes harry to dick well i didn t do so bad a job did i quite an idea explaining our situation with the thermometer and the flower pot that was really an apology for keeping him out there heaven knows some explanation was in order he is watching and sees tom coming now there he is claire and probably pretty well fed up with the weather claire goes to the door stops before it she and tom look at each other through the glass then she lets him in tom and now i am in for a time it seemed i was not to be in but after i got the idea that you were keeping me out there to see if i could get the idea it would be too humiliating for a wall of glass to keep one from understanding taking it from his pocket so there s the other thermometer where do you want it claire takes it claire and where s the pepper tom putting it on the table and here s the pepper harry pepper tom when claire sneezed i knew claire yes i knew if i sneezed you would bring the pepper tom funny how one always remembers the salt but the pepper gets overlooked in preparations and what is an egg without pepper harry nastily there s your egg edgeworth pointing to it on the floor claire decided it would be a good idea to smash everything so she began with your egg tom looking at his egg the idea of smashing everything is really more intriguing than an egg harry nice that you feel that way about it claire giving tom his coffee you want to hear something amusing i married harry because i thought he would smash something harry well that was an error in judgment claire i m such a naive trusting person harry laughs claire gives him a surprised look continues simply such a guileless soul that i thought flying would do something to a man but it didn t take us out we just took it in tom it s only our own spirit can take us out harry whatever you mean by out claire after looking intently at tom and considering it but our own spirit is not something on the loose mine isn t it has something to do with what i do to fly to be free in air to look from above on the world of all my days be where man has never been yes wouldn t you think the spirit could get the idea the earth grows smaller i am leaving what are they running around down there why do they run around down there houses houses are funny lines and down going slants houses are vanishing slants i am alone can i breathe this rarer air shall i go higher shall i go too high i am loose i am out but no man flew and returned to earth the man who left it harry and jolly well likely not to have returned at all if he d had those flighty notions while operating a machine claire oh harry not lightly asked can t you see it would be better not to have returned than to return the man who left it harry i have some regard for human life claire why no i am the one who has the regard for human life more lightly that was why i swiftly divorced my stick in the mud artist and married the man of flight but i merely passed from a stick in the mud artist to a dick stick in the air aviator harry speaking of your stick in the mud artist as you romantically call your first blunder isn t his daughter and yours due here to day claire i knew something was disturbing me elizabeth a daughter is being delivered unto me this morning i have a feeling it will be more painful than the original delivery she has been as they quaintly say educated prepared for her place in life harry and fortunately claire has a sister who is willing to give her young niece that place claire the idea of giving anyone a place in life harry yes the very idea claire yes as often the mocking thing gives true expression to what lies sombrely in her the war there was another gorgeous chance harry chance for what i call you claire i ask you to say what you mean claire i don t know precisely if i did there d be no use saying it at harry s impatient exclamation she turns to tom tom nodding the only thing left worth saying is the thing we can t say harry help claire yes but the war didn t help oh it was a stunning chance but fast as we could scuttled right back to the trim little thing we d been shocked out of harry you bet we did showing our good sense claire showing our incapacity for madness harry oh come now claire snap out of it you re not really trying to say that capacity for madness is a good thing to have claire in simple surprise why yes of course dick but i should say the war did leave enough madness to give you a gleam of hope claire not the madness that breaks through and it was a stunning chance mankind massed to kill we have failed we are through we will destroy break this up it can t go farther in the air above in the sea below it is to kill all we had thought we were we aren t we were shut in with what wasn t so is there one ounce of energy has not gone to this killing is there one love not torn in two throw it in now ready break up push harder break up and then and then but we didn t say and then the spirit didn t take the tip harry claire come now looking to the others for help let s talk of something else claire plants do it the big leap it s called explode their species because something in them knows they ve gone as far as they can go something in them knows they re shut in to just that so go mad that life may not be prisoned break themselves up into crazy things into lesser things and from the pieces may come one sliver of life with vitality to find the future how beautiful how brave tom as if he would call her from too far or would let her know he has gone with her claire claire her eyes turning to him why should we mind lying under the earth we who have no such initiative no proud madness why think it death to lie under life so flexible so ruthless and ever renewing anthony from the door of the inner room miss claire claire after an instant yes she goes with him as they disappear his voice heard show me now want those violets bedded harry oh this has got to stop i ve got to put a stop to it some way why claire used to be the best sport a man ever played around with i can t stand it to see her getting hysterical tom that was not hysterical harry what was it then i want to know tom it was a look harry oh i might have known i d get no help from either of you even you edgeworthy much as she thinks of you and fine sort as i ve no doubt you are you re doing claire no good encouraging her in these queer ways tom i couldn t change claire if i would harry and wouldn t if you could tom no but you don t have to worry about me i m going away in a day or two and i shall not be back harry trouble with you is it makes little difference whether you re here or away just the fact of your existence does encourage claire in this this way she s going tom with a smile but you wouldn t ask me to go so far as to stop my existence though i would do that for claire if it were the way to help her harry by jove you say that as if you meant it tom do you think i would say anything about claire i didn t mean harry you think a lot of her don t you tom nods you don t mean a laugh letting him say it that you re in love with claire tom in love oh that s much too easy certainly i do love claire harry well you re a cool one tom let her be herself can t you see she s troubled harry well what is there to trouble claire now i ask you it seems to me she has everything tom she s left so open too exposed as harry moves impatiently please don t be annoyed with me i m doing my best at saying it you see claire isn t hardened into one of those forms she talks about she s too aware always pulled toward what could be tormented by the lost adventure harry well there s danger in all that of course there s danger tom but you can t help that harry claire was the best fun a woman could be is yet at times tom let her be at times as much as she can and will she does need that don t keep her from it by making her feel you re holding her in it above all don t try to stop what she s doing here if she can do it with plants perhaps she won t have to do it with herself harry do what tom low after a pause break up what exists open the door to destruction in the hope of a door on the far side of destruction harry well you give me the willies moves around in irritation troubled to anthony who is passing through with a sprayer anthony have any arrangements been made about miss claire s daughter anthony i haven t heard of any arrangements harry well she ll have to have some heat in her room we can t all live out here anthony indeed you can not it is not good for the plants harry i m going where i can smoke goes out dick lightly but fascinated by the idea you think there is a door on the hinter side of destruction tom how can one tell where a door may be one thing i want to say to you for it is about you regards dick and not with his usual impersonal contemplation i don t think claire should have any door closed to her pause you know i think what i mean and perhaps you can guess how it hurts to say it whether it s mere escape within rather shameful escape within or the wild hope of that door through it s suddenly all human be good to her after a difficult moment smiles going away for ever is like dying so one can say things dick why do you do it go away for ever tom i haven t succeeded here dick but you ve tried the going away before tom never knowing i would not come back so that wasn t going away my hope is that this will be like looking at life from outside life dick but then you ll not be in it tom i haven t been able to look at it while in it dick isn t it more important to be in it than to look at it tom not what i mean by look dick it s hard for me to conceive of loving claire and going away from her for ever tom perhaps it s harder to do than to conceive of dick then why do it tom it s my only way of keeping her dick i m afraid i m like harry now i don t get you tom i suppose not your way is different with calm with sadness not with malice but i shall have her longer and from deeper dick i know that tom though i miss much much the buzzer tom looks around to see if anyone is coming to answer it then goes to the phone yes i ll see if i can get her to dick claire s daughter has arrived looking in the inner room returns to phone i don t see her catching a glimpse of anthony off right oh anthony where s miss claire her daughter has arrived anthony she s working at something very important in her experiments dick but isn t her daughter one of her experiments anthony after a baffled moment her daughter is finished tom at the phone sorry but i can t get to claire she appears to have gone below anthony closes the trap door i did speak to anthony but he says that claire is working at one of her experiments and that her daughter is finished i don t know how to make her hear i took the revolver back to the house anyway you will remember claire doesn t answer the revolver i hate to reach claire when she doesn t want to be reached why of course a daughter is very important but oh that s too bad putting down the receiver he says the girl s feelings are hurt isn t that annoying gingerly pounds on the trap door then with the other hand waits anthony has a gentle smile for the gentle tapping nods approval as tom returns to the phone she doesn t come up indeed i did with both fists sorry anthony please you won t try again to disturb miss claire will you dick her daughter is here anthony she hasn t seen her daughter for a year anthony well if she got along without a mother for a year goes back to his work dick smiling after anthony plants are queer perhaps it s safer to do it with pencil regards tom or with pure thought things that grow in the earth tom nodding i suppose because we grew in the earth dick i m always shocked to find myself in agreement with harry but i too am worried about claire and this looking at the plants tom it s her best chance dick don t you hate to go away to india for ever leaving claire s future uncertain tom you re cruel now and you knew that you were being cruel dick yes i like the lines of your face when you suffer tom the lines of yours when you re causing suffering i don t like them dick perhaps that s your limitation tom i grant you it may be they are silent i had an odd feeling that you and i sat here once before long ago and that we were plants and you were a beautiful plant and i i was a very ugly plant i confess it surprised me finding myself so ugly a plant a young girl is seen outside harry gets the door open for her and brings elizabeth in harry there s heat here and two of your mother s friends mr demming richard demming the artist and i think you and mr edgeworthy are old friends elizabeth comes forward she is the creditable young american well built poised cultivated so sound an expression of the usual as to be able to meet the world with assurance assurance which training has made rather graceful she is about seventeen and mature you feel solid things behind her tom i knew you when you were a baby you used to kick a great deal then elizabeth laughing with ease and scream i haven t a doubt but i ve stopped that one does doesn t one and it was you who gave me the idol tom proselytizing i m afraid elizabeth i beg oh yes laughing cordially i see she doesn t i dressed the idol up in my doll s clothes they fitted perfectly the idol was just the size of my doll ailine but mother didn t like the idol that way and tore the clothes getting them off to harry after looking around is mother here harry crossly yes she s here of course she s here and she must know you re here after looking in the inner room he goes to the trap door and makes a great noise elizabeth oh please really it doesn t make the least difference harry well all i can say is your manners are better than your mother s elizabeth but you see i don t do anything interesting so i have to have good manners lightly but leaving the impression there is a certain superiority in not doing anything interesting turning cordially to dick my father was an artist dick yes i know elizabeth he was a portrait painter do you do portraits dick well not the kind people buy elizabeth they bought father s dick yes i know he did that kind harry still irritated why you don t do portraits dick i did one of you the other day you thought it was a milk can elizabeth laughing delightedly no not really did you think how could you think as harry does not join the laugh oh i beg your pardon i does mother grow beautiful roses now harry no she does not the trap door begins to move claire s head appears elizabeth mother it s been so long she tries to overcome the difficulties and embrace her mother claire protecting a box she has careful elizabeth we mustn t upset the lice elizabeth retreating lice but quickly equal even to lice oh yes you take it them off plants don t you claire i m putting them on certain plants elizabeth weakly oh i thought you took them off claire calling anthony he comes the lice he takes them from her claire who has not fully ascended looks at elizabeth hesitates then suddenly starts back down the stairs harry outraged claire slowly she re ascends sits on the top step after a long pause in which he has waited for claire to open a conversation with her daughter well and what have you been doing at school all this time elizabeth oh studying claire studying what elizabeth why the things one studies mother claire oh the things one studies looks down cellar again dick after another wait and what have you been doing besides studying elizabeth oh the things one does tennis and skating and dancing and claire the things one does elizabeth yes all the things the the things one does though i haven t been in school these last few months you know miss lane took us to europe tom and how did you like europe elizabeth capably oh i thought it was awfully amusing all the girls were quite mad about europe of course i m glad i m an american claire why elizabeth laughing why mother of course one is glad one is an american all the girls claire turning away o h a moan under the breath elizabeth why mother aren t you well harry your mother has been working pretty hard at all this elizabeth oh i do so want to know all about it perhaps i can help you i think it s just awfully amusing that you re doing something one does nowadays doesn t one if you know what i mean it was the war wasn t it made it the thing to do something dick slyly and you thought claire that the war was lost elizabeth the war lost her capable laugh fancy our losing a war miss lane says we should give thanks she says we should each do some expressive thing you know what i mean and that this is the keynote of the age of course one s own kind of thing like mother growing flowers claire you think that is one s own kind of thing elizabeth why of course i do mother and so does miss lane all the girls claire shaking her head as if to get something out s hoo elizabeth what is it mother claire a fly shut up in my ear all the girls elizabeth laughing mother was always so amusing so different if you know what i mean vacations i ve lived mostly with aunt adelaide you know claire my sister who is fitted to rear children harry well somebody has to do it elizabeth and i do love aunt adelaide but i think its going to be awfully amusing to be around with mother now and help her with her work help do some useful beautiful thing claire i am not doing any useful beautiful thing elizabeth oh but you are mother of course you are miss lane says so she says it is your splendid heritage gives you this impulse to do a beautiful thing for the race she says you are doing in your way what the great teachers and preachers behind you did in theirs claire who is good for little more well all i can say is miss lane is stung elizabeth mother what a thing to say of miss lane from this slipping into more of a little girl manner oh she gave me a spiel one day about living up to the men i come from claire turns and regards her daughter claire you ll do it elizabeth elizabeth well i don t know quite a job i ll say of course i d have to do it in my way i m not going to teach or preach or be a stuffy person but now that she here becomes the product of a superior school values have shifted and such sensitive new things have been liberated in the world claire low don t use those words elizabeth why why not claire because you don t know what they mean elizabeth why of course i know what they mean claire turning away you re stepping on the plants harry hastily your mother has been working awfully hard at all this elizabeth well now that i m here you ll let me help you won t you mother claire trying for control you needn t bother elizabeth but i want to help add to the wealth of the world claire will you please get it out of your head that i am adding to the wealth of the world elizabeth but mother of course you are to produce a new and better kind of plant claire they may be new i don t give a damn whether they re better elizabeth but but what are they then claire as if choked out of her they re different elizabeth thinks a minute then laughs triumphantly but what s the use of making them different if they aren t better harry a good square question claire why don t you answer it claire i don t have to answer it harry why not give the girl a fair show you never have you know since she s interested why not tell her what it is you re doing claire she is not interested elizabeth but i am mother indeed i am i do want awfully to understand what you are doing and help you claire you can t help me elizabeth harry why not let her try claire why do you ask me to do that this is my own thing why do you make me feel i should goes to elizabeth i will be good to you elizabeth we ll go around together i haven t done it but you ll see we ll do gay things i ll have a lot of beaus around for you anything else not this is not this elizabeth as you like mother of course i just would have been so glad to to share the thing that interests you hurt borne with good breeding and a smile harry claire which says how can you claire who is looking at elizabeth yes i will try tom i don t think so as claire says anything else elizabeth why of course i don t at all want to intrude harry it ll do claire good to take someone in to get down to brass tacks and actually say what she s driving at claire oh harry but yes i will try does try but no words come laughs when you come to say it it s not one would rather not nail it to a cross of words laughs again with brass tacks harry affectionately but i want to see you put things into words claire and realize just where you are claire oddly you think that s a good idea elizabeth in her manner of holding the world capably in her hands now let s talk of something else i hadn t the least idea of making mother feel badly claire desperately no we ll go on though i don t know where we ll end i can t answer for that these plants beginning flounderingly perhaps they are less beautiful less sound than the plants from which they diverged but they have found otherness laughs a little shrilly if you know what i mean tom claire stop this to harry this is wrong claire excitedly no i m going on they have been shocked out of what they were into something they were not they ve broken from the forms in which they found themselves they are alien outside that s it outside if you know what i mean elizabeth not shocked from what she is but of course the object of it all is to make them better plants otherwise what would be the sense of doing it claire not reached by elizabeth out there giving it with her hands lies all that s not been touched lies life that waits back here the old pattern done again again and again so long done it doesn t even know itself for a pattern in immensity but this has invaded crept a little way into what wasn t strange lines in life unused and when you make a pattern new you know a pattern s made with life and then you know that anything may be if only you know how to reach it this has taken form not easily but with great struggle between feeling and words harry cordially now i begin to get you claire i never knew before why you called it the edge vine claire i should destroy the edge vine it isn t over the edge it s running back to all the girls it s a little afraid of miss lane looking sombrely at it you are out but you are not alive elizabeth why it looks all right mother claire didn t carry life with it from the life it left dick you know what i mean at least you ought to her ruthless way of not letting anyone s feelings stand in the way of truth then destroy it for me it s hard to do it with the hands that made it dick but what s the point in destroying it claire claire impatiently i ve told you it can not create dick but you say you can go on producing it and it s interesting in form claire and you think i ll stop with that be shut in with different life that can t creep on after trying to put destroying hands upon it it s hard to get past what we ve done our own dead things block the way tom but you re doing it this next time claire nodding to the inner room in there claire turning to that room i m not sure tom but you told me breath of life has already produced itself doesn t that show it has brought life from the life it left claire but timidly rather wistfully a little homesick if it is less sure this time then it is going back to miss lane but if the pattern s clearer now then it has made friends of life that waits i ll know to morrow elizabeth you know something tells me this is wrong claire the hymn singing ancestors are tuning up elizabeth i don t know what you mean by that mother but claire but we will now sing nearer my god to thee nearer to elizabeth laughingly breaking in well i don t care of course you can make fun at me but something does tell me this is wrong to do what what dick what god did elizabeth well yes unless you do it to make them better to do it just to do it that doesn t seem right to me claire roughly right to you and that s all you know of adventure and of anguish do you know it is you world of which you re so true a flower makes me have to leave you re there to hold the door shut because you re young and of a gayer world you think i can t see them those old men do you know why you re so sure of yourself because you can t feel can t feel the limitless out there a sea just over the hill i will not stay with you buries her hands in the earth around the edge vine but suddenly steps back from it as she had from elizabeth and i will not stay with you grasps it as we grasp what we would kill is trying to pull it up they all step forward in horror anthony is drawn in by this harm to the plant anthony miss claire miss claire the work of years claire may only make a prison struggling with harry who is trying to stop her you think i too will die on the edge she has thrown him away is now struggling with the vine why did i make you to get past you as she twists it oh yes i know you have thorns the edge vine should have thorns with a long tremendous pull for deep roots she has it up as she holds the torn roots oh i have loved you so you took me where i hadn t been elizabeth who has been looking on with a certain practical horror well i d say it would be better not to go there claire now i know what you are for flings her arm back to strike elizabeth with the edge vine harry wresting it from her claire are you mad claire no i m not mad i m too sane pointing to elizabeth and the words come from mighty roots to think that object ever moved my belly and sucked my breast elizabeth hides her face as if struck harry going to elizabeth turning to claire this is atrocious you re cruel he leads elizabeth to the door and out after an irresolute moment in which he looks from claire to tom dick follows anthony can not bear to go he stoops to take the edge vine from the floor claire s gesture stops him he goes into the inner room claire kicking the edge vine out of her way drawing deep breaths smiling o h how good i feel light a movement as if she could fly read me something tom dear or say something pleasant about god but be very careful what you say about him i have a feeling he s not far off curtain act ii late afternoon of the following day claire is alone in the tower a tower which is thought to be round but does not complete the circle the back is curved then jagged lines break from that and the front is a queer bulging window in a curve that leans the whole structure is as if given a twist by some terrific force like something wrong it is lighted by an old fashioned watchman s lantern hanging from the ceiling the innumerable pricks and slits in the metal throw a marvellous pattern on the curved wall like some masonry that hasn t been there are no windows at back and there is no door save an opening in the floor the delicately distorted rail of a spiral staircase winds up from below claire is seen through the huge ominous window as if shut into the tower she is lying on a seat at the back looking at a book of drawings to do this she has left the door of her lantern a little open and her own face is clearly seen a door is heard opening below laughing voices claire listens not pleased adelaide voice coming up dear dear why do they make such twisting steps harry take your time most up now harry s head appears he looks back making it all right adelaide i can t tell yet laughingly no i don t think so harry reaching back a hand for her the last lap is the bad lap adelaide is up and occupied with getting her breath harry since you wouldn t come down claire we thought we d come up adelaide as claire does not greet her i m sorry to intrude but i have to see you claire there are things to be arranged claire volunteering nothing about arrangements adelaide surveys the tower an unsympathetic eye goes from the curves to the lines which diverge then she looks from the window well at least you have a view harry this is the first time you ve been up here adelaide yes in the five years you ve had the house i was never asked up here before claire amiably enough you weren t asked up here now adelaide harry asked me claire it isn t harry s tower but never mind since you don t like it it s all right adelaide her eyes again rebuking the irregularities of the tower no i confess i do not care for it a round tower should go on being round harry claire calls this the thwarted tower she bought the house because of it going over and sitting by her his hand on her ankle didn t you old girl she says she d like to have known the architect adelaide probably a tiresome person too incompetent to make a perfect tower claire well now he s disposed of what next adelaide sitting down in a manner of capably opening a conference next elizabeth and you claire just what is the matter with elizabeth claire whose voice is cool even as if herself is not really engaged by this nothing is the matter with her she is a tower that is a tower adelaide well is that anything against her claire she s just like one of her father s portraits they never interested me nor does she looks at the drawings which do interest her adelaide a mother can not cast off her own child simply because she does not interest her claire an instant raising cool eyes to adelaide why can t she adelaide because it would be monstrous claire and why can t she be monstrous if she has to be adelaide you don t have to be that s where i m out of patience with you claire you are really a particularly intelligent competent person and it s time for you to call a halt to this nonsense and be the woman you were meant to be claire holding the book up to see another way what inside dope have you on what i was meant to be adelaide i know what you came from claire well isn t it about time somebody got loose from that what i came from made you so adelaide stiffly i see claire so you being such a tower of strength why need i too be imprisoned in what i came from adelaide it isn t being imprisoned right there is where you make your mistake claire who s in a tower in an unsuccessful tower not i i go about in the world free busy happy among people i have no time to think of myself claire no adelaide no my family the things that interest them from morning till night it s claire yes i know you have a large family adelaide five and elizabeth makes six adelaide we ll speak of elizabeth later but if you would just get out of yourself and enter into other people s lives claire then i would become just like you and we should all be just alike in order to assure one another that we re all just right but since you and harry and elizabeth and ten million other people bolster each other up why do you especially need me adelaide not unkindly we don t need you as much as you need us claire a wry face i never liked what i needed harry i am convinced i am the worst thing in the world for you claire claire with a smile for his tactics but shaking her head i m afraid you re not i don t know perhaps you are adelaide well what is it you want claire claire simply you wouldn t know if i told you adelaide that s rather arrogant harry yes take a chance claire i have been known to get an idea and adelaide quite frequently gets one claire the first resentment she has shown you two feel very superior don t you adelaide i don t think we are the ones who are feeling superior claire oh yes you are very superior to what you think is my feeling of superiority comparing my isolation with your heart of humanity soon we will speak of the beauty of common experiences of the oh i could say it all before we come to it harry adelaide came up here to help you claire claire adelaide came up here to lock me in well she can t do it adelaide gently but can t you see that one may do that to one s self claire thinks of this looks suddenly tired then smiles well at least i ve changed the keys harry locked in bunkum get that our of your head claire who s locked in nobody that i know of we re all free americans free as air adelaide i wish you d come and hear one of mr morley s sermons claire you re very old fashioned if you think sermons are what they used to be claire with interest and do they still sing nearer my god to thee adelaide they do and a noble old hymn it is it would do you no harm at all to sing it claire eagerly sing it to me adelaide i d like to hear you sing it adelaide it would be sacrilege to sing it to you in this mood claire falling back oh i don t know i m not so sure god would agree with you that would be one on you wouldn t it adelaide it s easy to feel one s self set apart claire no it isn t adelaide beginning anew it s a new age claire spiritual values claire spiritual values in her brooding way so you have pulled that up with cunning don t think i don t know what it is you do adelaide well what do i do i m sure i have no idea what you re talking about harry affectionately as claire is looking with intentness at what he does not see what does she do claire claire it s rather clever what she does snatching the phrase a movement as if pulling something up standing it up between her and the life that s there and by saying it enough we have life we have life we have life very good come back at one who would really be just so we are that right this way please that i suppose is what we mean by needing each other all join in the chorus this is it this is it this is it and anyone who won t join is to be visited by relatives regarding adelaide with curiosity do you really think that anything is going on in you adelaide stiffly i am not one to hold myself up as a perfect example of what the human race may be claire brightly well that s good harry claire claire humility s a real thing not just a fine name for laziness harry well lord a mighty you can t call adelaide lazy claire she stays in one place because she hasn t the energy to go anywhere else adelaide as if the last word in absurdity has been said i haven t energy claire mildly you haven t any energy at all adelaide that s why you keep so busy adelaide well claire s nerves are in a worse state than i had realized claire so perhaps we d better look at blake s drawings takes up the book adelaide it would be all right for me to look at blake s drawings you d better look at the sistine madonna affectionately after she has watched claire s face a moment what is it claire why do you shut yourself out from us claire i told you because i do not want to be shut in with you adelaide all of this is not very pleasant for harry harry i want claire to be gay claire funny you should want that speaks unwillingly a curious wistful unwillingness did you ever say a preposterous thing then go trailing after the thing you ve said and find it wasn t so preposterous here is the circle we are in describes a big circle being gay it shoots little darts through the circle and a minute later gaiety all gone and you looking through that little hole the gaiety left adelaide going to her as she is still looking through that little hole claire dear i wish i could make you feel how much i care for you simply with real feeling you can call me all the names you like dull commonplace lazy that is a new idea i confess but the rest of our family s gone now and the love that used to be there between us all the only place for it now is between you and me you were so much loved claire you oughtn t to try and get away from a world in which you are so much loved to harry mother father all of us always loved claire best we always loved claire s queer gaiety now you ve got to hand it to us for that as the children say claire moved but eyes shining with a queer bright loneliness but never one of you once looked with me through the little pricks the gaiety made never one of you once looked with me at the queer light that came in through the pricks adelaide and can t you see dear that it s better for us we didn t and that it would be better for you now if you would just resolutely look somewhere else you must see yourself that you haven t the poise of people who are held well within the circle if you choose to put it that way there s something about being in that main body having one s roots in the big common experiences gives a calm which you have missed that s why i want you to take elizabeth forget yourself and claire i do want calm but mine would have to be a calm i worked my way to a calm all prepared for me would stink adelaide less sympathetically i know you have to be yourself claire but i don t admit you have a right to hurt other people harry i think claire and i had better take a nice long trip adelaide now why don t you claire i am taking a trip adelaide well harry isn t and he d like to go and wants you to go with him go to paris and get yourself some awfully good looking clothes and have one grand fling at the gay world you really love that claire and you ve been awfully dull lately i think that s the whole trouble harry i think so too adelaide this sober business of growing plants claire not sober it s mad adelaide all the more reason for quitting it claire but madness that is the only chance for sanity adelaide come come now let s not juggle words claire springing up how dare you say that to me adelaide you who are such a liar and thief and whore with words adelaide facing her furious how dare you harry of course not claire you have the most preposterous way of using words claire i respect words adelaide well you ll please respect me enough not to dare use certain words to me claire yes i do dare i m tired of what you do you and all of you life experience values calm sensitive words which raise their heads as indications and you pull them up to decorate your stagnant little minds and think that makes you and because you have pulled that word from the life that grew it you won t let one who s honest and aware and troubled try to reach through to to what she doesn t know is there she is moved excited as if a cruel thing has been done why did you come here adelaide to try and help you but i begin to fear i can t do it it s pretty egotistical to claim that what so many people are is wrong claire after looking intently at adelaide slowly smiling a little describes a circle with deftly used hands makes a quick vicious break in the circle which is there in the air harry going to her taking her hands it s getting close to dinner time you were thinking of something else claire when i told you charlie emmons was coming to dinner to night answering her look sure he is a neurologist and i want him to see you i m perfectly honest with you cards all on the table you know that i m hoping if you like him and he s the best scout in the world that he can help you talking hurriedly against the stillness which follows her look from him to adelaide where she sees between them an understanding about her sure you need help claire your nerves are a little on the blink from all you ve been doing no use making a mystery of it or a tragedy emmons is a cracker jack and naturally i want you to get a move on yourself and be happy again claire who has gone over to the window and this neurologist can make me happy harry can make you well and then you ll be happy adelaide in the voice of now fixing it all up and i had just an idea about elizabeth instead of working with mere plants why not think of elizabeth as a plant and claire who has been looking out of the window now throws open one of the panes that swings out or seems to and calls down in great excitement claire tom tom quick up here i m in trouble harry going to the window that s a rotten thing to do claire you ve frightened him claire yes how fast he can run he was deep in thought and i stabbed right through harry well he ll be none too pleased when he gets up here and finds there was no reason for the stabbing they wait for his footsteps harry annoyed adelaide offended but stealing worried looks at claire who is looking fixedly at the place in the floor where tom will appear running footsteps tom his voice getting there before he does yes claire yes yes as his head appears what is it claire at once presenting him and answering his question my sister tom gasping oh why is that all i mean how do you do pardon i panting came up rather hurriedly harry if you want to slap claire tom i for one have no objection claire adelaide has the most interesting idea tom she proposes that i take elizabeth and roll her in the gutter just let her lie there until she breaks up into adelaide claire i don t see how even in fun pretty vulgar fun you can speak in those terms of a pure young girl i m beginning to think i had better take elizabeth claire oh i ve thought that all along adelaide and i m also beginning to suspect that oddity may be just a way of shifting responsibility claire cordially interested in this possibility now you know that might be adelaide a mother who does not love her own child you are an unnatural woman claire claire well at least it saves me from being a natural one adelaide oh i know you think you have a great deal but let me tell you you ve missed a great deal you ve never known the faintest stirring of a mother s love claire that s not true harry no claire loved our boy claire i m glad he didn t live harry low claire claire i loved him why should i want him to live harry come dear i m sorry i spoke of him when you re not feeling well claire i m feeling all right just because i m seeing something it doesn t mean i m sick harry well let s go down now about dinner time i shouldn t wonder if emmons were here as adelaide is starting down stairs coming claire claire no harry but it s time to go down for dinner claire i m not hungry harry but we have a guest two guests adelaide s staying too claire then you re not alone harry but i invited dr emmons to meet you claire her smile flashing tell him i am violent to night harry dearest how can you joke about such things claire so you do think they re serious harry irritated no i do not but i want you to come down for dinner adelaide come come claire you know quite well this is not the sort of thing one does claire why go on saying one doesn t when you are seeing one does to tom will you stay with me a while i want to purify the tower adelaide begins to disappear harry fine time to choose for a t te t te as he is leaving i d think more of you edgeworthy if you refused to humour claire in her ill breeding adelaide her severe voice coming from below it is not what she was taught claire no it s not what i was taught laughing rather timidly and perhaps you d rather have your dinner tom no claire we ll get something later i want to talk to you but she does not laughs absurd that i should feel bashful with you why am i so awkward with words when i go to talk to you tom the words know they re not needed claire no they re not needed there s something underneath an open way down below the way that words can go rather desperately it is there isn t it tom oh yes it is there claire then why do we never go it tom if we went it it would not be there claire is that true how terrible if that is true tom not terrible wonderful that it should of itself be there claire with the simplicity that can say anything i want to go it tom i m lonely up on top here is it that i have more faith than you or is it only that i m greedier you see you don t know her reckless laugh what you re missing you don t know how i could love you tom don t claire that isn t how it is between you and me claire but why can t it be every way between you and me tom because we d lose the open way the quality of his denial shows how strong is his feeling for her with anyone else not with you claire but you are the only one i want the only one all of me wants tom i know but that s the way it is claire you re cruel tom oh claire i m trying so hard to save it for us isn t it our beauty and our safeguard that underneath our separate lives no matter where we may be with what other there is this open way between us that s so much more than anything we could bring to being claire perhaps but it s different with me i m not all spirit tom his hand on her dear claire no don t touch me since moving you re going away to morrow he nods for always his head just moves assent india is just another country but there are undiscovered countries tom yes but we are so feeble we have to reach our country through the actual country lying nearest don t you do that yourself claire reach your country through the plants country claire my country you mean outside tom no i don t think it that way claire oh yes you do tom your country is the inside claire the innermost you are disturbed because you lie too close upon the heart of life claire restlessly i don t know you can think it one way or another no way says it and that s good at least it s not shut up in saying she is looking at her enclosing hand as if something is shut up there tom but also you know things may be freed by expression come from the unrealized into the fabric of life claire yes but why does the fabric of life have to freeze into its pattern it should doing it with her hands flow then turning like an unsatisfied child to him but i wanted to talk to you tom you are talking to me tell me about your flower that never was before your breath of life claire i ll know to morrow you ll not go until i know tom i ll try to stay claire it seems to me if it has then i have integrity in smiles it is as if the smile lets her say it otherness i don t want to die on the edge tom not you claire many do it s what makes them too smug in allness those dead things on the edge died distorted trying to get through oh don t think i don t see the edge vine a pause then swiftly do you know what i mean or do you think i m just a fool or crazy tom i think i know what you mean and you know i don t think you are a fool or crazy claire stabbed to awareness no matter where it takes you isn t that more than a safe place to stay telling him very simply despite the pattern of pain in her voice anguish may be a thread making patterns that haven t been a thread blue and burning tom to take her from what even he fears for her but you were telling me about the flower you breathed to life what is your breath of life claire an instant playing it s a secret a secret it s a trick distilled from the most fragile flowers there are it s only air pausing playing except far in one stab of red its quivering heart that asks a question but here s the trick i bred the air form to strength the strength shut up behind us i ve sent far out troubled i ll know tomorrow and i have another gift for breath of life some day though days of work lie in between some day i ll give it reminiscence fragrance that is no one thing in here but reminiscent silence she raises wet eyes we need the haunting beauty from the life we ve left i need that he takes her hands and breathes her name let me reach my country with you i m not a plant after all they don t accept me who does accept me will you tom my dear dear dear claire you move me so you stand alone in a clearness that breaks my heart her hands move up his arms he takes them to hold them from where they would go though he can hardly do it but you ve asked what you yourself could answer best we d only stop in the country where everyone stops claire we might come through to radiance tom radiance is an enclosing place claire perhaps radiance lighting forms undreamed her reckless laugh i d be willing to take a chance i d rather lose than never know tom no claire knowing you from underneath i know you couldn t bear to lose claire wouldn t men say you were a fool tom they would claire and perhaps you are he smiles a little i feel so desperate because if only i could show you what i am you might see i could have without losing but i m a stammering thing with you tom you do show me what you are claire i ve known a few moments that were life why don t they help me now one was in the air i was up with harry flying high it was about four months before david was born the doctor was furious pregnant women are supposed to keep to earth we were going fast i was flying i had left the earth and then within me movement for the first time stirred to life far in air movement within the man unborn he too would fly and so i always loved him he was movement and wonder in his short life were many flights i never told anyone about the last one his little bed was by the window he wasn t four years old it was night but him not asleep he saw the morning star you know the morning star brighter stranger reminiscent and a promise he pointed mother he asked me what is there beyond the stars a baby a sick baby the morning star next night the finger that pointed was suddenly bites her own finger but yes i am glad he would always have tried to move and too much would hold him wonder would die and he d laugh at soaring looking down sidewise though i liked his voice so i wish you d stay near me for i like your voice too tom claire that s choked almost too much claire one of her swift glances canny almost practical well i m glad if it is how can i make it more but what she sees brings its own change i know what it is you re afraid of it s because i have so much yes why shouldn t i say it passion you feel that in me don t you you think it would swamp everything but that isn t all there is to me tom oh i know it my dearest why it s because i know it you think i am a fool claire it s a thing that s sometimes more than i am and yet i i am more than it is tom i know i know about you claire i don t know that you do perhaps if you really knew about me you wouldn t go away tom you re making me suffer claire claire i know i am i want to why shouldn t you suffer now seeing it more clearly than she has ever seen it you know what i think about you you re afraid of suffering and so you stop this side in what you persuade yourself is suffering waits then sends it straight you know how it is with me and dick as she sees him suffer oh no i don t want to hurt you let it be you i ll teach you you needn t scorn it it s rather wonderful tom stop that claire that isn t you claire why are you so afraid of letting me be low if that is low you see cannily i believe in beauty i have the faith that can be bad as well as good and you know why i have the faith because sometimes from my lowest moments beauty has opened as the sea from a cave i saw immensity my love you re going away let me tell you how it is with me i want to touch you somehow touch you once before i die let me tell you how it is with me i do not want to work i want to be do not want to make a rose or make a poem want to lie upon the earth and know closes her eyes stop doing that words going into patterns they do it sometimes when i let come what s there thoughts take pattern then the pattern is the thing but let me tell you how it is with me it flows again all that i do or say it is to what it comes from a drop lifted from the sea i want to lie upon the earth and know but scratch a little dirt and make a flower scratch a bit of brain something like a poem covering her face stop doing that help me stop doing that tom and from the place where she had carried him don t talk at all lie still and know and know that i am knowing claire yes but we are so weak we have to talk to talk to touch why can t i rest in knowing i would give my life to reach you that has all there is but i must put my timid hands upon you do something about infinity oh let what will flow into us and fill us full and leave us still wring me dry and let me fill again with life more pure to know to feel and do nothing with what i feel and know that s being good that s nearer god drenched in the feeling that has flowed through her but surprised helpless why i said your thing didn t i opened my life to bring you to me and what came is what sends you away tom no what came is what holds us together what came is what saves us from ever going apart brokenly my beautiful one you you brave flower of all our knowing claire i am not a flower i am too torn if you have anything help me breathe breathe the healing oneness and let me know in calm with a sob his head rests upon her claire her hands on his head but looking far beauty you pure one thing breathe let me know in calm then trouble me trouble me for other moments in farther calm slow motionless barely articulate tom as she does not move he lifts his head and even as he looks at her she does not move nor look at him claire his hand out to her a little afraid you went away from me then you are away from me now claire yes and i could go on but i will come back it is hard to do she brings much with her that too i will give you my by myself ness that s the uttermost i can give i never thought to try to give it but let us do it the great sacrilege yes excited she rises she has his hands and bring him up beside her let us take the mad chance perhaps it s the only way to save what s there how do we know how can we know risk risk everything from all that flows into us let it rise all that we never thought to use to make a moment let it flow into what could be bring all into life between us or send all down to death oh do you know what i am doing risk risk everything why are you so afraid to lose what holds you from me test all let it live or let it die it is our chance our chance to bear what s there my dear one i will love you so with all of me i am not afraid now of all of me be generous be unafraid life is for life though it cuts us from the farthest life how can i make you know that s true all that we re open to hesitates shudders but yes i will i will risk the life that waits perhaps only he who gives his loneliness shall find you never keep by holding gesture of giving to the uttermost and it is gone or it is there you do not know and that makes the moment music has begun a phonograph downstairs they do not heed it just as i would cut my wrists holding them out yes perhaps this lesser thing will tell it would cut my wrists and let the blood flow out till all is gone if my last drop would make would make looking at them fascinated i want to see it doing that let me give my last chance for life to he snatches her they are on the brink of their moment now that there are no words the phonograph from downstairs is louder it is playing languorously the barcarole they become conscious of this they do not want to be touched by the love song claire don t listen that s nothing this isn t that fearing i tell you it isn t that yes i know that s amorous enclosing i know a little place this isn t that her arms going around him all the lure of that while she pleads against it as it comes up to them we will come out to radiance in far places admitting using oh then let it be that go with it give up the otherness i will and in the giving up perhaps a door we d never find by searching and if it s no more than all have known i only say it s worth the allness her arms wrapped round him my love my love let go your pride in loneliness and let me give you joy tom drenched in her passion but fighting it s you in anguish you rare thing untouched not not into this not back into this by me lover of your apartness she steps back she sees he can not she stands there before what she wanted more than life and almost had and lost a long moment then she runs down the stairs claire her voice coming up harry choke that phonograph if you want to be lewd do it yourselves you tawdry things you cheap little lewd cowards a door heard opening below harry if you don t stop that music i ll kill myself far down steps on stairs harry claire what is this claire stop that phonograph or i ll harry why of course i ll stop it what what is there to get so excited about now now just a minute dear it ll take a minute claire comes back upstairs dragging steps face ghastly the amorous song still comes up and louder now that doors are open she and tom do not look at one another then on a languorous swell the music comes to a grating stop they do not speak or move quick footsteps harry comes up harry what in the world were you saying claire certainly you could have asked me more quietly to turn off the victrola though what harm was it doing you way up here a sharp little sound from claire she checks it her hand over her mouth harry looks from her to tom well i think you two would better have had your dinner won t you come down now and have some claire only now taking her hand from her mouth harry tell him to come up here that insanity man i want to ask him something harry insanity man how absurd he s a nerve specialist there s a vast difference claire is there anyway ask him to come up here want to ask him something tom speaking with difficulty wouldn t it be better for us to go down there claire no so nice up here everybody up here harry worried you ll be yourself will you claire she checks a laugh nods i think he can help you claire want to ask him to help me harry as he is starting down he s here as a guest to night you know claire claire i suppose a guest can help one tom when the silence rejects it claire you must know it s because it is so much so claire be still there isn t anything to say tom torn tortured if it only weren t you claire yes so you said if it weren t i suppose i wouldn t be so interested hears them starting up below keeps looking at the place where they will appear harry is heard to call coming dick and dick s voice replies in a moment or two adelaide comes first adelaide as her head appears well these stairs should keep down weight you missed an awfully good dinner claire and kept mr edgeworth from a good dinner claire yes we missed our dinner her eyes do not leave the place where dr emmons will come up harry as he and emmons appear claire this is claire yes i know who he is i want to ask you adelaide let the poor man get his breath before you ask him anything he nods smiles looks at claire with interest careful not to look too long at her surveys the tower emmons curious place adelaide yes it lacks form doesn t it claire what do you mean how dare you it is impossible to ignore her agitation she is backed against the curved wall as far as possible from them harry looks at her in alarm then in resentment at tom who takes a step nearer claire harry trying to be light don t take it so hard claire claire to emmons it must be very interesting helping people go insane adelaide claire how preposterous emmons easily i hope that s not precisely what we do adelaide with the smile of one who is going to cover it trust claire to put it in the unique and amusing way claire amusing you are amused but it doesn t matter to the doctor i think it is very kind of you helping people go insane i suppose they have all sorts of reasons for having to do it reasons why they can t stay sane any longer but tell me how do they do it it s not so easy to get out how do so many manage it emmons i d like immensely to have a talk with you about all this some day adelaide certainly this is not the time claire claire the time when you can t go any farther isn t that that adelaide capably taking the whole thing into matter of factness what i think is claire has worked too long with plants there s something not quite sound about making one thing into another thing what we need is unity from claire something like a moan yes dear we do need it to the doctor i can t say that i believe in making life over like this i don t think the new species are worth it at least i don t believe in it for claire if one is an intense sensitive person claire isn t there any way to stop her always always smothering it with the word for it emmons soothingly but she can t smother it anything that s really there she can t hurt with words claire looking at him with eyes too bright then you don t see it either angry yes she can hurt it piling it up always piling it up between us and what there clogging the way always to emmons i want to cease to know that s all i ask darken it darken it if you came to help me strike me blind emmons you re really all tired out aren t you oh we ve got to get you rested claire they deny it saying they have it and he half looks at tom quickly looks away others deny it afraid of losing it we re in the way can t you see the dead stuff piled in the path pointing dick voice coming up me too claire staring at the path hearing his voice a moment after it has come yes dick you too why not you too after he has come up what is there any more than you are dick embarrassed by the intensity but laughing a question not at all displeasing to me who can answer it claire more and more excited yes who can answer it going to him in terror let me go with you and be with you and know nothing else adelaide gasping why harry claire this is going a little too claire far but you have to go far to clinging to dick only a place to hide your head what else is there to hope for i can t stay with them piling it up always piling it up i can t get through to he won t let me through to what i don t know is there dick would help her regain herself don t push me away don t don t stand me up i will go back to the worst we ever were go back and remember what we ve tried to forget adelaide it s time to stop this by force if there s no other way the doctor shakes his head claire all i ask is to die in the gutter with everyone spitting on me changes to a curious weary smiling quiet still why should they bother to do that harry brokenly you re sick claire there s no denying it looks at emmons who nods adelaide something to quiet her to stop it claire throwing her arms around dick you dick not them not any of them dick claire you are overwrought you must harry to dick as if only now realizing that phase of it i ll tell you one thing you ll answer to me for this he starts for dick is restrained by emmons chiefly by his grave shake of the head with harry s move to them dick has shielded claire claire yes hold me keep me you have mercy you will have mercy anything everything that will let me be nothing curtain act iii in the greenhouse the same as act i anthony is bedding small plants where the edge vine grew in the inner room the plant like caught motion glows as from a light within hattie the maid rushes in from outside anthony turning angrily you are not what this place hattie anthony come in the house i m afraid mr archer i never saw him like this he s talking to mr demming something about mrs archer anthony who in spite of himself is disturbed by her agitation and if it is it s no business of yours hattie you don t know how he is i went in the room and anthony well he won t hurt you will he hattie how do i know who he ll hurt a person s whose seeing how to get him maybe he ll hurt mrs archer anthony startled then smiles no he won t hurt miss claire hattie what do you know about it out here in the plant house anthony and i don t want to know about it this is a very important day for me it s breath of life i m thinking of today not you and mr archer hattie well suppose he does something to mr demming anthony mr demming will have to look out for himself i am at work resuming work hattie don t you think i ought to tell mrs archer that anthony you let her alone this is no day for her to be bothered by you at eleven o clock looks at watch she comes out here to breath of life hattie with greed for gossip did you see any of them when they came downstairs last night anthony i was attending to my own affairs hattie they was all excited mr edgeworth he went away he was gone all night i guess i saw him coming back just as the milkman woke me up now he s packing his things he wanted to get to mrs archer too just a little while ago but she won t open her door for none of them i can t even get in to do her room anthony then do some other room and leave me alone in this room hattie a little afraid of what she is asking is she sick anthony or what vindicating herself as he gives her a look the doctor he stayed here late but she d locked herself in i heard mr archer anthony you heard too much he starts for the door to make her leave but dick rushes in looks around wildly goes to the trap door finds it locked anthony what are you doing here dick trying not to be shot if you must know this is the only place i can think of till he comes to his senses and i can get away open that will you rather ignominious but better be absurd than be dead hattie has he got the revolver dick gone for it thought i wouldn t sit there till he got back to anthony look here don t you get the idea get me some place where he can t come anthony it is not what this place is for dick any place is for saving a man s life hattie sure anthony mrs archer wouldn t want mr demming shot dick that s right anthony miss claire will be angry at you if you get me shot he makes for the door of the inner room anthony you can t go in there it s locked harry rushes in from outside harry i thought so he has the revolver hattie screams anthony now mr archer if you ll just stop and think you ll know miss claire wouldn t want mr demming shot harry you think that can stop me you think you can stop me raising the revolver a dog that anthony keeping squarely between harry and dick well you can t shoot him in here it is not good for the plants harry is arrested by this reason and especially not today why mr archer breath of life may flower today it s years miss claire s been working for this day harry i never thought to see this day anthony no did you oh it will be a wonderful day and how she has worked for it she has an eye that sees what isn t right in what looks right many s the time i ve thought here the form is set and then she d say we ll try this one and it had what i hadn t known was there she s like that harry i ve always been pleased anthony at the way you ve worked with miss claire this is hardly the time to stand there eulogizing her and she s can hardly say it things you don t know she is anthony proudly oh i know that you think i could work with her and not know she s more than i know she is harry well if you love her you ve got to let me shoot the dirty dog that drags her down anthony not in here not today more than like you d break the glass and breath of life s in there harry anthony this is pretty clever of you but anthony i m not clever but i know how easy it is to turn life back no i m not clever at all claire has appeared and is looking in from outside but i do know there are things you mustn t hurt he sees her yes here s miss claire she comes in she is looking immaculate claire from the gutter i rise again refreshed one does you know nothing is fixed not even the gutter smilingly to harry and refusing to notice revolver or agitation how did you like the way i entertained the nerve specialist harry claire you can joke about it claire taking the revolver from the hand she has shocked to limpness whom are you trying to make hear harry i m trying to make the world hear that pointing there stands a dirty dog who claire listen harry turning to hattie who is over by the tall plants at right not wanting to be shot but not wanting to miss the conversation you can do my room now hattie hattie goes if you re thinking of shooting dick you can t shoot him while he s backed up against that door anthony just what i told them miss claire just what i told them claire and for that matter it s quite dull of you to have any idea of shooting him harry i may be dull i know you think i am but i ll show you that i ve enough of the man in me to claire to make yourself ridiculous if i ran out and hid my head in the mud would you think you had to shoot the mud dick stung out of fear that s pretty cruel claire well would you rather be shot harry so you just said it to protect him claire i change it to grass nodding to dick grass if i hid my face in the grass would you have to burn the grass harry oh claire how can you when you know how i love you and how i m suffering claire with interest are you suffering harry haven t you eyes claire i should think it would do something to you harry god have you no heart the door opens tom comes in claire scarcely saying it yes i have a heart tom after a pause i came to say good bye claire god have you no heart can t you at least wait till dick is shot tom claire now sees the revolver in her hand that is turned from him going to her claire claire and even you think this is so important carelessly raises the revolver and with her left hand out flat tells tom not to touch her harry thinks it important he shoot dick and dick thinks it important not to be shot and you think i mustn t shoot anybody even myself and can t any of you see that none of that is as important as where revolvers can t reach putting revolver where there is no edge vine i shall never shoot myself i m too interested in destruction to cut it short by shooting after looking from one to the other laughs pointing one two three you love me but why do you bring it out here anthony who has resumed work it is not what this place is for claire no this place is for the destruction that can get through anthony miss claire it is eleven at eleven we are to go in and see claire whether it has gone through but how can we go with dick against the door anthony he ll have to move claire and be shot harry irritably oh he ll not be shot claire can spoil anything dick steps away from the door claire takes a step nearer it claire halting have i spoiled everything i don t want to go in there anthony we re going in together miss claire don t you remember oh looking resentfully at the others don t let any little thing spoil it for you the work of all those days the hope of so many days claire yes that s it anthony you re afraid you haven t done it claire yes but afraid i have harry cross but kindly that s just nervousness claire i ve had the same feeling myself about making a record in flying claire curiously grateful you have harry harry glad enough to be back in a more usual world sure i ve been afraid to know and almost as afraid of having done it as of not having done it claire nods steps nearer then again pulls back claire i can t go in there she almost looks at tom not today anthony but miss claire there ll be things to see today we can t see tomorrow claire you bring it in here anthony in out from its own place she nods and where they are again she nods reluctantly he goes to the door i will not look into the heart no one must know before you know in the inner room his head a little turned away he is seen very carefully to lift the plant which glows from within as he brings it in no one looks at it harry takes a box of seedlings from a stand and puts them on the floor that the newcomer may have a place anthony breath of life is here miss claire claire half turns then stops claire look and see what you see anthony no one should see what you ve not seen claire i can t see until i know anthony looks into the flower anthony agitated miss claire claire it has come through anthony it has gone on claire stronger anthony stronger surer claire and more fragile anthony and more fragile claire look deep no turning back anthony after a searching look the form is set he steps back from it claire then it is out from where she stands she turns slowly to the plant you weren t you are anthony but come and see miss claire claire it s so much more than i d see harry well i m going to see looking into it i never saw anything like that before there seems something alive inside this outer shell dick he too looking in and he has an artist s manner of a hand up to make the light right it s quite new in form it says something about form harry cordially to claire who stands apart so you ve really put it over well well congratulations it s a good deal of novelty i should say and i ve no doubt you ll have a considerable success with it people always like something new i m mighty glad after all your work and i hope it will set you up claire low and like a machine will you all go away anthony goes into the other room harry why why yes but oh claire can t you take some pleasure in your work as she stands there very still emmons says you need a good long rest and i think he s right tom can t this help you claire let this be release this breath of the uncaptured claire and though speaking she remains just as still breath of the uncaptured you are a novelty out you have been brought in a thousand years from now when you are but a form too long repeated perhaps the madness that gave you birth will burst again and from the prison that is you will leap pent queernesses to make a form that hasn t been to make a person new and this we call creation very low her head not coming up go away tom goes harry hesitates looking in anxiety at claire he starts to go stops looks at dick from him to claire but goes a moment later dick moves near claire stands uncertainly then puts a hand upon her she starts only then knowing he is there claire a slight shrinking away but not really reached um um he goes claire steps nearer her creation she looks into what hasn t been with her breath and by a gentle moving of her hands she fans it to fuller openness as she does this tom returns and from outside is looking in at her softly he opens the door and comes in she does not know that he is there in the way she looks at the flower he looks at her tom claire she lifts her head as you stood there looking into the womb you breathed to life you were beautiful to me beyond any other beauty you were life and its reach and its anguish i can t go away from you i will never go away from you it shall all be as you wish i can go with you where i could not go alone if this is delusion i want that delusion it s more than any reality i could attain as she does not move speak to me claire you are glad claire from far speak to you pause do i know who you are tom i think you do claire oh yes i love you that s who you are waits again but why are you something very far away tom come nearer claire nearer feeling it with her voice nearer but i think i am going the other way tom no claire come to me did you understand dear i am not going away claire you re not going away tom not without you claire and you and i will be together is that what you wanted claire wanted as if wanting is something that harks far back but the word calls to her passion wanted a sob hands out she goes to him but before his arms can take her she steps back are you trying to pull me down into what i wanted are you here to make me stop tom how can you ask that i love you because it is not in you to stop claire and loving me for that would stop me oh help me see it it is so important that i see it tom it is important it is our lives claire and more than that i can not see it because it is so much more than that tom don t try to see all that it is from peace you ll see a little more claire peace troubled as we are when looking at what we can not see clearly what is peace peace is what the struggle knows in moments very far apart peace that is not a place to rest are you resting what are you you who d take me from what i am to something else tom i thought you knew claire claire i know what you pass for but are you beauty beauty is that only living pattern the trying to take pattern are you trying tom within myself claire i never thought you doubted that claire beauty is it she turns to breath of life as if to learn it there but turns away with a sob if i can not go to you now i will always be alone tom takes her in his arms she is shaken then comes to rest tom yes rest and then come into joy you have so much life for joy claire raising her head called by promised gladness we ll run around together lovingly he nods up hills all night on hills tom tenderly all night on hills claire we ll go on the sea in a little boat tom on the sea in a little boat claire but there are other boats on other seas drawing back from him troubled there are other boats on other seas tom drawing her back to him my dearest not now not now claire her arms going round him oh i would love those hours with you i want them i want you they kiss but deep in her is sobbing reminiscence her hand feeling his arm as we touch what we would remember reminiscence with one of her swift changes steps back from him how dare you pass for what you re not we are tired and so we think it s you stop with you don t get through to what you re in the way of beauty is not something you say about beauty tom i say little about beauty claire claire your life says it by standing far off you pass for it smother it with a life that passes for it but beauty getting it from the flower beauty is the humility breathed from the shame of succeeding tom but it may all be within one s self dear claire drawn by this but held and desperate because she is held when i have wanted you with all my wanting why must i distrust you now when i love you with all of me why do i know that only you are worth my hate tom it s the fear of easy satisfactions i love you for it claire over the flower breath of life you here are you lonely breath of life tom claire hear me don t go where we can t go as there you made a shell for life within make for yourself a life in which to live it must be so claire as you made for yourself a shell called beauty tom what is there for you if you ll have no touch with what we have claire what is there there are the dreams we haven t dreamed there is the long and flowing pattern she follows that but suddenly and as if blindly goes to him i am tired i am lonely i m afraid he holds her soothing but she steps back from him and because we are tired lonely and afraid we stop with you don t get through to what you re in the way of tom then you don t love me claire i m fighting for my chance i don t know which chance is drawn to the other chance to breath of life looks into it as if to look through to the uncaptured and through this life just caught comes the truth she chants i ve wallowed at a coarse man s feet i m sprayed with dreams we ve not yet come to i ve gone so low that words can t get there i ve never pulled the mantle of my fears around me and called it loneliness and called it god only with life that waits have i kept faith with effort raising her eyes to the man and only you have ever threatened me tom coming to her and with strength now and i will threaten you i m here to hold you from where i know you can not go you re trying what we can t do claire what else is there worth trying tom i love you and i will keep you from fartherness from harm you are mine and you will stay with me roughly you hear me you will stay with me claire her head on his breast in ecstasy of rest drowsily you can keep me tom darling i can keep you i will keep you safe claire troubled by the word but barely able to raise her head safe tom bringing her to rest again trust me claire claire not lifting her head but turning it so she sees breath of life now can i trust what is suddenly pushing him roughly away no i will beat my life to pieces in the struggle to tom to what claire claire not to stop it by seeming to have it with fury i will keep my life low low that i may never stop myself or anyone with the thought it s what i have i d rather be the steam rising from the manure than be a thing called beautiful with sight too clear now i know who you are it is you puts out the breath of life image of beauty you fill the place should be a gate in agony oh that it is you fill the place should be a gate my darling that it should be you who her hands moving on him let me tell you something never was loving strong as my loving of you do you know that oh know that know it now her arms go around his neck hours with you i d give my life to have that it should be you he would loosen her hands for he can not breathe but when she knows she is choking him that knowledge is fire burning its way into the last passion it is you it is you tom words coming from a throat not free claire what are you doing then she knows what she is doing claire to his resistance no you are too much you are not enough still wanting not to hurt her he is slow in getting free he keeps stepping backward trying in growing earnest to loosen her hands but he does not loosen them before she has found the place in his throat that cuts off breath as he gasps breath of life my gift to you she has pushed him against one of the plants at right as he sways strength she never had before pushes him over backward just as they have struggled from sight violent crash of glass is heard tom faint smothered voice no i m hurt claire in the frenzy and agony of killing oh gift oh gift there is no sound claire rises steps back is seen now is looking down gift like one who does not know where she is she moves into the room looks around takes a step toward breath of life turns and goes quickly to the door stops as if stopped sees the revolver where the edge vine was slowly goes to it holds it as if she can not think what it is for then raises it high and fires above through the place in the glass left open for ventilation anthony comes from the inner room his eyes go from her to the body beyond harry rushes in from outside harry who fired that claire i did lonely seeing anthony s look harry s eyes follow it harry oh what what dick comes running in who claire dick sees goes to tom claire yes i did it my gift harry is he he isn t he isn t tries to go in there can not there is the sound of broken glass of a position being changed then dick reappears dick his voice in jerks it s it s no use but i ll go for a doctor harry no no oh i suppose falling down beside claire his face against her my darling how can i save you now claire speaking each word very carefully saved myself anthony i did it don t you see i didn t want so many around not what this place is for harry snatching at this but lets it go she wouldn t let looking up at claire then quickly hiding his face and don t you see claire out a little like a child s pleased surprise out dick stands there as if unable to get to the door his face distorted biting his hand anthony miss claire you can do anything won t you try claire reminiscence speaking the word as if she has left even that but smiles a little anthony takes reminiscence the flower she was breeding for fragrance for breath of life holds it out to her but she has taken a step forward past them all claire out as if feeling her way nearer her voice now feeling the way to it nearer voice almost upon it my god falling upon it with surprise to thee breathing it nearer to thee e en though it be a slight turn of the head toward the dead man she loves a mechanical turn just as far the other way a cross that her head going down raises me her head slowly coming up singing it still all my song shall be nearer my slowly the curtain begins to shut her out the last word heard is the final nearer a faint breath from far curtain inheritors inheritors was first performed at the provincetown playhouse on

mississippi a room that has been long and comfortably lived in and showing that first hand contact with materials which was pioneer life the hospitable table was made on the place well and strongly made there are braided rugs and the wooden chairs have patchwork cushions there is a corner closet left rear a picture of abraham lincoln on the floor a home made toy boat at rise of curtain there are on the stage an old woman and a young man grandmother morton is in her rocking chair near the open door facing left on both sides of door are windows looking out on a generous land she has a sewing basket and is patching a boy s pants she is very old her hands tremble her spirit remembers the days of her strength smith has just come in and hat in hand is standing by the table this was lived in the year afternoon of fourth of july smith but the celebration was over two hours ago grandmother oh celebration that s just the beginning of it might as well set down when them boys that fought together all get in one square they have to swap stories all over again that s the worst of a war you have to go on hearing about it so long here it is and we haven t taken gettysburg yet well it was the same way with the war of smith who is now seated at the table the war of grandmother news to you that we had a war with the indians smith that s right the blackhawk war i ve heard of it grandmother heard of it smith were your men in that war grandmother i was in that war i threw an indian in the cellar and stood on the door i was heavier then smith those were stirring times grandmother more stirring than you ll ever see this war lincoln s war it s all a cut and dried business now we used to fight with anything we could lay hands on dish water whatever was handy smith i guess you believe the saying that the only good indian is a dead indian grandmother i dunno we roiled them up considerable they was mostly friendly when let be didn t want to give up their land but i ve noticed something of the same nature in white folks smith your son has something of that nature hasn t he grandmother he s not keen to sell why should he it ll never be worth less smith but since he has more land than any man can use and if he gets his price grandmother that what you ve come to talk to him about smith i yes grandmother well you re not the first many a man older than you has come to argue it smith smiling they thought they d try a young one grandmother some one that knew him thought that up silas d help a young one if he could what is it you re set on buying smith oh i don t know that we re set on buying anything if we could have the hill looking off to the right at a fair price grandmother the hill above the town silas d rather sell me and the cat smith but what s he going to do with it grandmother maybe he s going to climb it once a week smith but if the development of the town demands its use grandmother smiling you the development of the town smith i represent it this town has been growing so fast grandmother this town began to grow the day i got here smith you you began it grandmother my husband and i began it and our baby silas smith when was that grandmother that was smith and you mean you were here all alone grandmother no we weren t alone we had the owens ten miles down the river smith but how did you get here grandmother got here in a wagon how do you s pose gaily think we flew smith but wasn t it unsafe grandmother them set on safety stayed back in ohio smith but one family i should think the indians would have wiped you out grandmother the way they wiped us out was to bring fish and corn we d have starved to death that first winter hadn t been for the indians smith but they were such good neighbours why did you throw dish water at them grandmother that was after other white folks had roiled them up white folks that didn t know how to treat em this very land land you want to buy was the land they loved blackhawk and his indians they came here for their games this was where their fathers as they called em were buried i ve seen my husband and blackhawk climb that hill together a backward point right he used to love that hill blackhawk he talked how the red man and the white man could live together but poor old blackhawk what he didn t know was how many white man there was after the war when he was beaten but not conquered in his heart they took him east washington philadelphia new york and when he saw the white man s cities it was a different indian came back he just let his heart break without ever turning a hand smith but we paid them for their lands she looks at him paid them something grandmother something for fifteen million acres of this mississippi valley land best on this globe we paid two thousand two hundred and thirty four dollars and fifty cents and promised to deliver annually goods to the value of one thousand dollars not a fancy price even for them days children s voices are heard outside she leans forward and looks through the door left ira let that cat be smith looking from the window these i suppose are your grandchildren grandmother the boy s my grandson the little girl is madeline fejevary mr fejevary s youngest child smith the fejevary place adjoins on this side pointing right down grandmother yes we ve been neighbours ever since the fejevarys came here from hungary after he was a count at home and he s a man of learning but he was a refugee because he fought for freedom in his country nothing silas could do for him was too good silas sets great store by learning and freedom smith thinking of his own project looking off toward the hill the hill is not seen from the front i suppose then mr fejevary has great influence with your son grandmother more an anybody silas thinks twas a great thing for our family to have a family like theirs next place to well so twas for we ve had no time for the things their family was brought up on old mrs fejevary with her shrewd smile she weren t stuck up but she did have an awful ladylike way of feeding the chickens silas thinks oh my son has all kinds of notions though a harder worker never found his bed at night smith and mr fejevary is he a veteran too grandmother dryly you don t seem to know these parts well for one that s all stirred up about the development of the town yes felix fejevary and silas morton went off together down that road motioning with her hand right when them of their age was wanted fejevary came back with one arm less than he went with silas brought home everything he took and something he didn t rheumatiz so now they set more store by each other an ever seems nothing draws men together like killing other men a boy s voice teasingly imitating a cat madeline make ira let that cat be a whoop from the girl a boy s whoop looking there they go off for the creek if they set in it seems about to call after them gives this up well they re not the first rather dreams over this smith you must feel as if you pretty near owned this country grandmother we worked a country don t make itself when the sun was up we were up and when the sun went down we didn t as if this renews the self of those days here let me set out something for you to eat gets up with difficulty smith oh no please never mind i had something in town before i came out grandmother dunno as that s any reason you shouldn t have something here she goes off right he stands at the door looking toward the hill until she returns with a glass of milk a plate of cookies smith well this looks good grandmother i ve fed a lot of folks take it by and large i didn t care how many i had to feed in the daytime what s ten or fifteen more when you re up and around but to get up after sixteen hours on your feet i was willin but my bones complained some smith but did you keep a tavern grandmother keep a tavern i guess we did every house is a tavern when houses are sparse you think the way to settle a country is to go on ahead and build hotels that s all you folks know why i never went to bed without leaving something on the stove for the new ones that might be coming and we never went away from home without seein there was a plenty for them that might stop smith they d come right in and take your food grandmother what else could they do there was a woman i always wanted to know she made a kind of bread i never had before and left a plenty for our supper when we got back with the ducks and berries and she left the kitchen handier than it had ever been i often wondered about her where she came from and where she went as she dreams over this there is laughing and talking at the side of the house there come the boys mr fejevary comes in followed by silas morton they are men not far from sixty wearing their army uniforms carrying the muskets they used in the parade fejevary has a lean distinguished face his dark eyes are penetrating and rather wistful the left sleeve of his old uniform is empty silas morton is a strong man who has borne the burden of the land and not for himself alone the pioneer seeing the stranger he sets his musket against the wall and holds out his hand to him as mr fejevary goes up to grandmother morton silas how do stranger fejevary and how are you today mrs morton grandmother i m not abed and don t expect to be silas letting go of the balloons he has bought where s ira and madeline grandmother mr fejevary s delia brought them home with her they ve gone down to dam the creek i guess this young man s been waiting to see you silas smith yes i wanted to have a little talk with you silas well why not he is tying the gay balloons to his gun then as he talks hangs his hat in the corner closet we ve been having a little talk ourselves mother nat rice was there i ve not seen nat rice since the day we had to leave him on the road with his torn leg him cursing like a pirate i wanted to bring him home but he had to go back to chicago his wife s dead mother grandmother well i guess she s not sorry silas why mother grandmother why mother nat rice is a mean stingy complaining man his leg notwithstanding where d you leave the folks silas oh scattered around everybody visitin with anybody that ll visit with them wish you could have gone grandmother i ve heard it all to fejevary your folks well fejevary all well mrs morton and my boy felix is home he ll stop in here to see you by and by silas oh he s a fine looking boy mother and think of what he knows cordially including the young man mr fejevary s son has been to harvard college smith well well quite a trip well mr morton i hope this is not a bad time for me to present a little matter to you silas genially that depends of course on what you re going to present attracted by a sound outside mind if i present a little matter to your horse like to uncheck him so s he can geta a bit o grass smith why yes i suppose he would like that silas going out you bet he d like it wouldn t you old boy smith your son is fond of animals grandmother lots of people s fond of em and good to em silas i dunno it s as if he was that animal fejevary he has imagination grandmother with surprise think so silas returning and sitting down at the table by the young man now what s in your mind my boy smith this town is growing very fast mr morton silas yes slyly with humour i know that smith i presume you as one of the early settlers as in fact a son of the earliest settler feel a certain responsibility about the welfare of silas i haven t got in mind to do the town a bit of harm so what s your point smith more people more homes and homes must be in the healthiest places the the most beautiful places isn t it true mr fejevary that it means a great deal to people to have a beautiful outlook from their homes a well an expanse silas what is it they want to buy these fellows that are figuring on making something out of expanse a gesture for expanse then a reassuring gesture it s all right but just what is it smith i am prepared to make you an offer a gilt edged offer for that pointing toward it hill above the town silas shaking his head with the smile of the strong man who is a dreamer the hill is not for sale smith but wouldn t you consider a particularly good offer mr morton silas who has turned so he can look out at the hill slowly shakes his head smith do you feel you have the right the moral right to hold it silas it s not for myself i m holding it smith oh for the children silas yes the children smith but if you ll excuse me there are other investments might do the children even more good silas this seems to me the best investment smith but after all there are other people s children to consider silas yes i know that s it smith i wonder if i understand you mr morton silas kindly i don t believe you do i don t see how you could and i can t explain myself just now so the hill is not for sale i m not making anybody homeless there s land enough for all all sides round but the hill smith rising is yours silas you ll see smith i am prepared to offer you silas you re not prepared to offer me anything i d consider alongside what i am considering so i wish you good luck in your business undertakings smith sorry you won t let us try to help the town silas don t sit up nights worrying about my chokin the town smith we could make you a rich man mr morton do you think what you have in mind will make you so much richer silas much richer smith well good bye good day sir good day ma am silas following him to the door nice horse you ve got smith yes seems all right silas stands in the doorway and looks off at the hill grandmother what are you going to do with the hill silas silas after i get a little glass of wine to celebrate felix and me being here instead of farther south i d like to tell you what i want for the hill to fejevary rather bashfully i ve been wanting to tell you fejevary i want to know silas getting the wine from the closet just a little something to show our gratitude with goes off right for glasses grandmother i dunno maybe it d be better to sell the hill while they re anxious fejevary he seems to have another plan for it grandmother yes well i hope the other plan does bring him something silas has worked all the days of his life fejevary i know grandmother you don t know the hull of it but i know rather to herself know too well to think about it grandmother as silas returns i ll get more cookies silas i ll get them mother grandmother get em myself pity if a woman can t get out her own cookies silas seeing how hard it is for her i wish mother would let us do things for her fejevary that strength is a flame frailness can t put out it s a great thing for us to have her this touch with the life behind us silas yes and it s a great thing for us to have you who can see those things and say them what a lot i d a missed if i hadn t had what you ve seen fejevary oh you only think that because you ve got to be generous silas i m not generous i m seeing something now something about you i ve been thinking of it a good deal lately it s got something to do with with the hill i ve been thinkin what it s meant all these years to have a family like yours next place to they did something pretty nice for the corn belt when they drove you out of hungary funny how things don t end the way they begin i mean what begins don t end it s another thing ends set out to do something for your own country and maybe you don t quite do the thing you set out to do fejevary no silas but do something for a country a long way off fejevary i m afraid i ve not done much for any country silas brusquely where s your left arm may i be so bold as to inquire though your left arm s nothing alongside what can t be measured fejevary when i think of what i dreamed as a young man it seems to me my life has failed silas raising his glass well if your life s failed i like failure grandmother morton returns with her cookies grandmother there s two kinds mr fejevary these have seeds in em fejevary thank you i ll try a seed cookie first silas mother you ll have a glass of wine grandmother i don t need wine silas well i don t know as we need it grandmother no i don t know as you do but i didn t go to war fejevary then have a little wine to celebrate that grandmother well just a mite to warm me up not that it s cold fejevary brings it to her and the cookies the indians used to like cookies i was talking to that young whippersnapper about the indians one time i saw an indian watching me from a bush points right out there i was never afraid of indians when you could see the whole of em but when you could see nothin but their bright eyes movin through leaves i declare they made me nervous after he d been there an hour i couldn t seem to put my mind on my work so i thought red or white a man s a man i ll take him some cookies fejevary it succeeded grandmother so well that those leaves had eyes next day but he brought me a fish to trade he was a nice boy silas probably we killed him grandmother i dunno maybe he killed us will owens family was massacred just after this like as not my cookie indian helped out there something kind of uncertain about the indians silas i guess they found something kind of uncertain about us grandmother six o one and half a dozen of another usually is silas to fejevary i wonder if i m wrong you see i never went to school grandmother i don t know why you say that silas there was two winters you went to school silas yes mother and i m glad i did for i learned to read there and liked the geography globe it made the earth so nice to think about and one day the teacher told us all about the stars and i had that to think of when i was driving at night the other boys didn t believe it was so but i knew it was so but i mean school the way mr fejevary went to school he went to universities in his own countries in other countries all the things men have found out the wisest and finest things men have thought since first they began to think all that was put before them fejevary with a gentle smile i fear i left a good deal of it untouched silas you took a plenty tell in your eyes you ve thought lots about what s been thought and that s what i was setting out to say it makes something of men learning a house that s full of books makes a different kind of people oh of course if the books aren t there just to show off grandmother like in mary baldwin s new house silas trying hard to see it it s not the learning itself it s the life that grows up from learning learning s like soil like like fertilizer get richer see more feel more you believe that fejevary culture should do it silas does in your house you somehow know how it is for the other fellow more n we do grandmother well silas morton when you ve your wood to chop an your water to carry when you kill your own cattle and hogs tend your own horses and hens make your butter soap and cook for whoever the lord sends there s none too many hours of the day left to be polite in silas you re right mother it had to be that way but now that we buy our soap we don t want to say what soap making made us grandmother we re honest silas yes in a way but there s another kind o honesty seems to me goes with that more seein kind of kindness our honesty with the indians was little to brag on grandmother you fret more about the indians than anybody else does silas to look out at that hill sometimes makes me ashamed grandmother land sakes you didn t do it it was the government and what a government does is nothing for a person to be ashamed of silas i don t know about that why is he here why is felix fejevary not rich and grand in hungary to day cause he was ashamed of what his government was grandmother well that was a foreign government silas a seeing how tis for the other person a bein that other person kind of honesty joke of it twould do something for you twould a done something for us to have been indians a little more my father used to talk about blackhawk they was friends i saw blackhawk once when i was a boy to fejevary guess i told you you know what he looked like he looked like the great of the earth noble noble like the forests and the mississippi and the stars his face was long and thin and you could see the bones and the bones were beautiful looked like something that s never been caught he was something many nights in his canoe had made him sometimes i feel that the land itself has got a mind that the land would rather have had the indians grandmother well don t let folks hear you say it they d think you was plum crazy silas i s pose they would turning to fejevary but after you ve walked a long time over the earth and you all alone didn t you ever feel something coming up from it that s like thought fejevary i m afraid i never did but i wish i had silas i love land this land i suppose that s why i never have the feeling that i own it grandmother if you don t own it i want to know what do you think we come here for your father and me what do you think we left our folks for left the world of white folks schools and stores and doctors and set out in a covered wagon for we didn t know what we lost a horse lost our way weeks longer than we thought twould be you were born in that covered wagon you know that but what you don t know is what that s like without your own roof or fire without she turns her face away silas no no mother of course not now now isn t this too bad i don t say things right it s because i never went to school grandmother her face shielded you went to school two winters silas yes yes mother so i did and i m glad i did grandmother with the determination of one who will not have her own pain looked at mrs fejevary s pansy bed doing well this summer fejevary it s beautiful this summer she was so pleased with the new purple kind you gave her i do wish you could get over to see them grandmother yes well i ve seen lots of pansies suppose it was pretty fine sounding speeches they had in town fejevary too fine sounding to seem much like the war silas i d like to go to a war celebration where they never mentioned war there d be a way to celebrate victory hearing a step looking out mother here s felix felix a well dressed young man comes in grandmother how do felix felix and how do you do grandmother morton grandmother well i m still here felix of course you are it wouldn t be coming home if you weren t grandmother i ve got some cookies for you felix i set em out so you wouldn t have to steal them john and felix was hard on the cookie jar felix where is john silas who is pouring a glass of wine for felix you ve not seen john yet he was in town for the exercises i bet those young devils ran off to the race track i heard whisperin goin round but everybody ll be home some time mary and the girls don t ask me where they are they ll drive old bess all over the country before they drive her to the bam your father and i come on home cause i wanted to have a talk with him felix getting into the old uniforms makes you want to talk it all over again silas the war well we did do that but all that makes me want to talk about what s to come about what twas all for great things are to come felix and before you are through felix i ve been thinking about them myself walking around the town to day it s grown so much this year and in a way that means more growing that big glucose plant going up down the river the new lumber mill all that means many more people fejevary and they ve even bought ground for a steel works silas yes a city will rise from these cornfields a big rich place that s bound to be it s written in the lay o the land and the way the river flows but first tell us about harvard college felix ain t it a fine thing for us all to have felix coming home from that wonderful place felix you make it seem wonderful silas ah you know it s wonderful know it so well you don t have to say it it s something you ve got but to me it s wonderful the way the stars are wonderful this place where all that the world has learned is to be drawn from me like a spring felix you almost say what matthew arnold says a distinguished new english writer who speaks of the best that has been thought and said in the world silas the best that has been thought and said in the world slowly rising and as if the dream of years is bringing him to his feet that s what that hill is for pointing don t you see it end of our trail we climb a hill and plant a college plant a college so s after we are gone that college says for us says in people learning has made more that is why we took this land grandmother incredulous you mean silas you re going to give the hill away silas the hill at the end of our trail how could we keep that grandmother well i want to know why not hill or level land s land and not a thing you give away silas well don t scold me i m not giving it away it s giving itself away get down to it grandmother don t talk to me as if i was feeble minded silas i m talking with all the mind i ve got if there s not mind in what i say it s because i ve got no mind but i have got a mind to fejevary humorously haven t i you ought to know seeing as you gave it to me fejevary ah no i didn t give it to you silas well you made me know twas there you said things that woke things in me and i thought about them as i ploughed and that made me know there had to be a college there wake things in minds so ploughing s more than ploughing what do you say felix felix it it s a big idea uncle silas i love the way you put it it s only that i m wondering silas wondering how it can ever be a harvard college well it can t and it needn t be stubbornly it s a college in the cornfields where the indian maize once grew and it s for the boys of the cornfields and the girls there s few can go to harvard college but more can climb that hill turn of the head from the hill to felix harvard on a hill as felix smiles no silas turns back to the hill a college should be on a hill they can see it then from far around see it as they go out to the barn in the morning see it when they re shutting up at night twill make a difference even to them that never go grandmother now silas don t be hasty silas hasty it s been company to me for years came to me one night must a been ten years ago middle of a starry night as i was comin home from your place to fejevary i d gone over to lend a hand with a sick horse an fejevary with a grateful smile that was nothing new silas well say i d sit up with a sick horse that belonged to the meanest man unhung but there were stars that night had never been there before leastways i d not seen em and the hill felix in all your travels east did you ever see anything more beautiful than that hill felix it s like sculpture silas hm the wistfulness with which he speaks of that outside his knowledge i s pose tis it s the way it rises somehow as if it knew it rose from wide and fertile lands i climbed the hill that night to fejevary you d been talkin as we waited between medicines you told me about your life as a young man all you d lived through seemed to open up to you that night way things do at times guess it was cause you thought you was goin to lose your horse see that was colonel the sorrel wasn t it fejevary yes good old colonel silas you d had a long run o off luck hadn t got things back in shape since the war but say you didn t lose him did you fejevary thanks to you silas thanks to the medicine i keep in the back kitchen fejevary you encouraged him grandmother silas has a way with all the beasts silas we ve got the same kind of minds the beasts and me grandmother silas i wish you wouldn t talk like that and with felix just home from harvard college silas same kind of minds except that mine goes on a little farther grandmother well i m glad to hear you say that silas well there we sat you an me middle of a starry night out beside your barn and i guess it came over you kind of funny you should be there with me way off the mississippi tryin to save a sick horse seemed to bring your life to life again you told me what you studied in that fine old university you loved the vienna and why you became a revolutionist the old dreams took hold o you and you talked way you used to i suppose the years o course had rubbed some of it off your face as you went on about the vision you called it vision of what life could be i knew that night there was things i never got wind of when i went away knew i ought to go home to bed hayin at daybreak go to bed i said to myself strike this dead when you ve never had it before may never have it again i climbed the hill blackhawk was there grandmother why he was dead silas he was there on his own old hill with me and the stars and i said to him grandmother silas silas says i to him yes that s true it s more yours than mine you had it first and loved it best but it s neither yours nor mine though both yours and mine not my hill not your hill but hill of vision said i to him here shall come visions of a better world than was ever seen by you or me old indian chief oh i was drunk plum drunk grandmother i should think you was and what about the next day s hay silas a day in the hayfield is a day s hayin but a night on the hill felix we don t have them often do we uncle silas silas i wouldn t a had that one but for your father felix thank god they drove you out o hungary and it s all so dog gone queer ain t it queer how things blow from mind to mind like seeds lord a mighty you don t know where they ll take hold children s voices off grandmother there come those children up from the creek soppin wet i warrant well i don t know how children ever get raised but we raise more of em than we used to i buried three first ten years i was here needn t a happened if we d known what we know now and if we hadn t been alone with all her strength i don t know what you mean the hill s not yours silas it s the future s mother so s we can know more than we know now grandmother we know it now twas then we didn t know it i worked for that hill and i tell you to leave it to your own children silas there s other land for my own children this is for all the children grandmother what s all the children to you silas derisively oh mother what a thing for you to say you who were never too tired to give up your own bed so the stranger could have a better bed grandmother that was different they was folks on their way fejevary so are we silas turns to him with quick appreciation grandmother that s just talk we re settled now children of other old settlers are getting rich i should think you d want yours to silas i want other things more i want to pay my debts fore i m too old to know they re debts grandmother momentarily startled debts huh more talk you don t owe any man silas i owe him nodding to fejevary and the red boys here before me grandmother fiddlesticks felix you haven t read darwin have you uncle silas silas who felix darwin the great new man and his theory of the survival of the fittest silas no no i don t know things like that felix felix i think he might make you feel better about the indians in the struggle for existence many must go down the fittest survive this had to be silas us and the indians guess i don t know what you mean fittest felix he calls it that best fitted to the place in which one finds one s self having the qualities that can best cope with conditions do things from the beginning of life it s been like that he shows the growth of life from forms that were hardly alive the lowest animal forms jellyfish up to man silas oh yes that s the thing the churches are so upset about that we come from monkeys felix yes one family of ape is the direct ancestor of man grandmother you d better read your bible felix silas do people believe this felix the whole intellectual world is at war about it the best scientists accept it teachers are losing their positions for believing it of course ministers can t believe it grandmother i should think not anyway what s the use believing a thing that s so discouraging fejevary gently but is it that it almost seems to me we have to accept it because it is so encouraging holding out his hand why have we hands grandmother cause god gave them to us i s pose fejevary but that s rather general and there isn t much in it to give us self confidence but when you think we have hands because ages back before life had taken form as man there was an impulse to do what had never been done when you think that we have hands today because from the first of life there have been adventurers those of best brain and courage who wanted to be more than life had been and that from aspiration has come doing and doing has shaped the thing with which to do it gives our hand a history which should make us want to use it well silas breathed from deep well by god and you ve known this all this while dog gone you why didn t you tell me fejevary i ve been thinking about it i haven t known what to believe this hurts beliefs of earlier years felix the things it hurts will have to go fejevary i don t know about that felix perhaps in time we ll find truth in them felix oh if you feel that way father fejevary don t be kind to me my boy i m not that old silas but think what it is you ve said if it s true that we made ourselves made ourselves out of the wanting to be more created ourselves you might say by our own courage our what is it aspiration why i can t take it in i haven t got the mind to take it in and what mind i have got says no it s too fejevary it fights with what s there silas nodding but it s like i got this very slowly other way around from underneath as if i d known it all along but have just found out i know it yes the earth told me the beasts told me grandmother fine place to learn things from silas anyhow haven t i seen it to fejevary in your face haven t i seen thinking make a finer face how long has this taken felix to well you might say bring us where we are now felix oh we don t know how many millions of years since earth first stirred silas then we are what we are because through all that time there ve been them that wanted to be more than life had been felix that s it uncle silas silas but why then we aren t finished yet fejevary no we take it on from here silas slowly then if we don t be the most we can be if we don t be more than life has been we go back on all that life behind us go back on the unable to formulate it he looks to fejevary fejevary go back on the dreaming and the daring of a million years after a moment s pause silas gets up opens the closet door grandmother silas what you doing silas who has taken out a box i m lookin for the deed to the hill grandmother what you going to do with it silas i m going to get it out of my hands grandmother get it out of your hands he has it now deed your father got from the government the very year the government got it from the indians rising give me that she turns to fejevary tell him he s crazy we got the best land cause we was first here we got a right to keep it fejevary going soothingly to her it s true silas it is a serious thing to give away one s land silas you ought to know you did it are you sorry you did it fejevary no but wasn t that different silas how was it different yours was a fight to make life more wasn t it well let this be our way grandmother what s all that got to do with giving up the land that should provide for our own children silas isn t it providing for them to give them a better world to live in felix you re young i ask you ain t it providing for them to give them a chance to be more than we are felix i think you re entirely right uncle silas but it s the practical question that silas if you re right the practical question is just a thing to fix up fejevary i fear you don t realize the immense amount of money required to finance a college the land would be a start you would have to interest rich men you d have to have a community in sympathy with the thing you wanted to do grandmother can t you see silas that we re all against you silas all against me to fejevary but how can you be look at the land we walked in and took was there ever such a chance to make life more why the buffalo here before us was more than we if we do nothing but prosper god damn us if we sit here rich and fat and forget man s in the makin affirming against this there will one day be a college in these cornfields by the mississippi because long ago a great dream was fought for in hungary and i say to that old dream wake up old dream wake up and fight you say rich men holding it out but it is not taken i give you this deed to take to rich men to show them one man believes enough in this to give the best land he s got that ought to make rich men stop and think grandmother stop and think he s a fool silas to fejevary it s you can make them know he s not a fool when you tell this way you can tell it they ll feel in you what s more than them they ll listen grandmother i tell you silas folks are too busy silas too busy too busy bein nothin if it s true that we created ourselves out of the thoughts that came then thought is not something outside the business of life thought with his gift for wonder why thought s our chance i know now why i can t forget the indians we killed their joy before we killed them we made them less to fejevary and as if sure he is now making it clear i got to give it back their hill i give it back to joy a better joy joy o aspiration fejevary moved but unconvinced but my friend there are men who have no aspiration that s why to me this is as a light shining from too far grandmother old things waked in her light shining from far we used to do that we never pulled the curtain i used to want to you like to be to yourself when night conies but we always left a lighted window for the traveller who d lost his way felix i should think that would have exposed you to the indians grandmother yes impatiently well you can t put out a light just because it may light the wrong person fejevary no and this is as a light to him he turns to the hill no silas with gentleness and profoundly that s it look again maybe your eyes are stronger now don t you see it i see that college rising as from the soil itself as if it was what come at the last of that thinking that breathes from the earth i see it but i want to know it s real before i stop knowing then maybe i can lie under the same sod with the red boys and not be ashamed we re not old let s fight wake in other men what you woke in me fejevary and so could i pay my debt to america his hand goes out silas giving him the deed and to the dreams of a million years standing near the open door their hands are gripped in compact curtain act ii scene a corridor in the library of morton college october of the year upon the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of its founding this is an open place in the stacks of books which are seen at both sides there is a reading table before the big rear window this window opens out but does not extend to the floor only a part of its height is seen indicating a very high window outside is seen the top of a tree this outer wall of the building is on a slant so that the entrance right is near and the left is front right front is a section of a huge square column on the rear of this facing the window is hung a picture of silas morton two men are standing before this portrait senator lewis is the midwestern state senator he is not of the city from which morton college rises but of a more country community farther in state felix fejevary now nearing the age of his father in the first act is an american of the more sophisticated type prosperous having the poise of success in affairs and place in society senator and this was the boy who founded the place eh it was his idea fejevary yes and his hill i was there the afternoon he told my father there must be a college here i wasn t any older then than my boy is now as if himself surprised by this senator well he enlisted a good man when he let you in on it i ve been told the college wouldn t be what it is today but for you mr fejevary fejevary i have a sentiment about it and where our sentiment is there our work goes also senator yes well it was those mainsprings of sentiment that won the war he is pleased with this fejevary nodding morton college did her part in winning the war senator i know a fine showing fejevary and we re holding up our end right along you ll see the boys drill this afternoon it s a great place for them here on the hill shows up from so far around they re a fine lot of fellows you know i presume that they went in as strike breakers during the trouble down here at the steel works the plant would have had to close but for morton college that s one reason i venture to propose this thing of a state appropriation for enlargement why don t we sit down a moment there s no conflict with the state university they have their territory we have ours ours is an important one industrially speaking the state will lose nothing in having a good strong college here a one hundred per cent american college senator i admit i am very favourably impressed fejevary i hope you ll tell your committee so and let me have a chance to talk to them senator let s see haven t you a pretty radical man here fejevary i wonder if you mean holden senator holden s the man i ve read things that make me question his americanism fejevary oh gesture of depreciation i don t think he is so much a radical as a particularly human human being senator but we don t want radical human beings fejevary he has a genuine sympathy with youth that s invaluable in a teacher you know and then he s a scholar he betrays here his feeling of superiority to his companion but too subtly for his companion to get it senator oh scholar we can get scholars enough what we want is americans fejevary americans who are scholars senator you can pick em off every bush pay them a little more than they re paid in some other cheap john college excuse me i don t mean this is a cheap john college fejevary of course not one couldn t think that of morton college but that pay them a little more interests me that s another reason i want to talk to your committee on appropriations we claim to value education and then we let highly trained gifted men fall behind the plumber senator well that s the plumber s fault let the teachers talk to the plumber fejevary with a smile no better not let them talk to the plumber he might tell them what to do about it in fact is telling them senator that s ridiculous they can t serve both god and mammon fejevary then let god give them mammon i mean let the state appropriate senator of course this state mr fejevary appropriates no money for radicals excuse me but why do you keep this man holden fejevary in the scholar s world we re known because of him and really holden s not a radical in the worst sense what he doesn t see is expediency not enough the man of affairs to realize that we can t always have literally what we have theoretically he s an idealist something of the man of vision senator if he had the right vision he d see that we don t every minute have literally what we have theoretically because we re fighting to keep the thing we have oh i sometimes think the man of affairs has the only vision take you mr fejevary a banker these teachers books books pushing all books back why if they had to take for one day the responsibility that falls on your shoulders big decisions to make man among men and all the time worries irritations particularly now with labour riding the high horse like a fool i know something about these things i went to the state house because my community persuaded me it was my duty but i m the man of affairs myself fejevary oh yes i know your company did much to develop that whole northern part of the state senator i think i may say we did well that s why after three sessions i m chairman of the appropriations committee i know how to use money to promote the state so teacher that would be a perpetual vacation to me now if you want my advice mr fejevary i think your case before the state would be stronger if you let this fellow holden go fejevary i m going to have a talk with professor holden senator tell him it s for his own good the idea of a college professor standing up for conscientious objectors fejevary that doesn t quite state the case fred jordan was one of holden s students a student he valued he felt jordan was perfectly sincere in his objection senator sincere in his objections the nerve of him thinking it was his business to be sincere fejevary he was expelled from college you may remember that was how we felt about it senator i should hope so fejevary holden fought that but within the college what brought him into the papers was his protest against the way the boy has been treated in prison senator what s the difference how he s treated you know how i d treat him a movement as though pulling a trigger if i didn t know you for the american you are i wouldn t understand your speaking so calmly fejevary i m simply trying to see it all sides around senator makes me see red fejevary with a smile but we mustn t meet red with red senator what s holden fussing about that they don t give him caviare on toast fejevary that they didn t give him books holden felt it was his business to fuss about that senator well when your own boy stead of whining around about his conscience stood up and offered his life fejevary yes and my nephew gave his life senator that so fejevary silas morton s grandson died in france my sister madeline married ira morton son of silas morton senator i knew there was a family connection between you and the mortons fejevary speaking with reserve they played together as children and married as soon as they were grown up senator so this was your sister s boy fejevary nods one of the mothers to give her son fejevary speaking of her with effort my sister died long ago pulled to an old feeling with an effort releasing himself but ira is still out at the old place place the mortons took up when they reached the end of their trail as uncle silas used to put it why it s a hundred years ago that grandmother morton began making cookies here she was the first white woman in this country senator proud woman to have begun the life of this state oh our pioneers if they could only see us now and know what they did fejevary is silent he does not look quite happy i suppose silas morton s son is active in the college management fejevary no ira is not a social being fred s death about finished him he had been strange for years ever since my sister died when the children were little it was again pulled back to that old feeling under pretty terrible circumstances senator i can see that you thought a great deal of your sister mr fejevary fejevary oh she was beautiful and bitterly it shouldn t have gone like that senator seems to me i ve heard something about silas morton s son though perhaps it wasn t this one fejevary ira is the only one living here now the others have gone farther west senator isn t there something about corn fejevary yes his corn has several years taken the prize best in the state he s experimented with it created a new kind they ve given it his name morton corn it seems corn is rather fascinating to work with very mutable stuff it s a good thing ira has it for it s about the only thing he does care for now oh madeline of course he has a daughter here in the college madeline morton senior this year one of our best students i d like to have you meet madeline she s a great girl though peculiar senator well that makes a girl interesting if she isn t peculiar the wrong way sounds as if her home life might make her a little peculiar fejevary madeline stays here in town with us a good part of the time mrs fejevary is devoted to her we all are a boy starts to come through from right hello see who s here this is my boy horace this is senator lewis who is interested in the college horace shaking hands how do you do senator lewis senator pleased to see you my boy horace am i butting in fejevary not seriously but what are you doing in the library i thought this was a day off horace i m looking for a book fejevary affectionately bantering you are horace now how does that happen horace i want the speeches of abraham lincoln senator you couldn t do better horace i ll show those dirty dagoes where they get off fejevary you couldn t show them a little more elegantly horace i m going to sick the legion on em fejevary are you talking about the hindus horace yes the dirty dagoes fejevary hindus aren t dagoes you know horace horace well what s the difference this foreign element gets my goat senator my boy you talk like an american but what do you mean hindus fejevary there are two young hindus here as students and they re good students horace sissies fejevary but they must preach the gospel of free india non british india senator oh that won t do horace they re nothing but reds i ll say well one of em s going back to get his grins fejevary there were three of them last year one of them is wanted back home senator i remember now he s to be deported horace and when they get him movement as of pulling a rope they hang there fejevary the other two protest against our not fighting the deportation of their comrade they insist it means death to him brushing off a thing that is inclined to worry him but we can t handle india s affairs senator i should think not horace why england s our ally that s what i told them but you can t argue with people like that just wait till i find the speeches of abraham lincoln passes through to left senator fine boy you have mr fejevary fejevary he s a live one you should see him in a football game wouldn t hurt my feelings in the least to have him a little more of a student but senator oh well you want him to be a regular fellow don t you and grow into a man among men fejevary he ll do that i think it was he who organized our boys for the steel strike went right in himself and took a striker s job he came home with a black eye one night presented to him by a picket who started something by calling him a scab but horace wasn t thinking about his eye according to him it was not in the class with the striker s upper lip father he said i gave him more red than he could swallow the blood just well i ll spare you but horace s muscle is one hundred per cent american going to the window let me show you something you can see the old morton place off on that first little hill pointing left the first rise beyond the valley senator the long low house fejevary that s it you see the town for the most part swung around the other side of the hill so the morton place is still a farm senator but you re growing all the while the town ll take the cornfield yet fejevary yes our steel works is making us a city senator and this old boy turning to the portrait of silas morton can look out on his old home and watch the valley grow fejevary yes that was my idea his picture really should be in memorial hall but i thought uncle silas would like to be up here among the books and facing the old place with a laugh i confess to being a little sentimental senator we americans have lots of sentiment mr fejevary it s what makes us what we are fejevary does not speak there are times when the senator seems to trouble him well this is a great site for a college you can see it from the whole country round fejevary yes that was uncle silas idea he had a reverence for education it grew in part out of his feeling for my father he was a poet really uncle silas looking at the picture he gave this hill for a college that we might become a deeper more sensitive people two girls convulsed with the giggles come tumbling in doris confused oh oh excuse us fussie foolishly we didn t know anybody was here mr fejevary looks at them sternly the girls retreat senator laughing oh well girls will be girls i ve got three of my own horace comes back carrying an open book horace say this must be a misprint fejevary glancing at the back of the book oh i think not horace from his first inaugural address to congress march reads this country with its institutions belong to the people who inhabit it well that s all right whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it after a brief consideration i suppose that that s all right but listen or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it fejevary he was speaking in another age an age of different values senator terms change their significance from generation to generation horace i suppose they do but that puts me in bad with these lice they quoted this and i said they were liars senator and what s the idea they re weary of our existing government and are about to dismember or overthrow it horace i guess that s the dope fejevary look here horace speak accurately was it in relation to america they quoted this horace well maybe they were talking about india then but they were standing up for being revolutionists we were giving them an earful about it and then they spring lincoln on us got their nerve i ll say quoting lincoln to us senator the fact that they are quoting it shows it s being misapplied horace approvingly i ll tell them that but gee lincoln oughta been more careful what he said ignorant people don t know how to take such things goes back with book fejevary want to take a look through the rest of the library we haven t been up this way yet motioning left we need a better scientific library they are leaving now oh we simply must have more money the whole thing is fairly bursting its shell doris venturing in cautiously from the other side looking back beckoning they ve gone fussie sure doris well are they here and i saw them i tell you they went up to science fussie moving the senator s hat on the table but they ll come back doris what if they do we re only looking at a book running her hand along the books matthew arnold takes a paper from fussie puts it in the book they are bent with giggling as horace returns horace for the love o pete what s the joke taking the book from the helpless girl matthew arnold my idea of nowhere to go for a laugh when i wrote my theme on him last week he was so dry i had to go out and get a morton sundee the girls are freshly attacked though all of this in a subdued way mindful of others in the library say how d you get that way doris now horace don t you tell horace what d i tell except seeing the paper um hum what s this doris trying to get it from him horace now don t you a tussle you great strong mean thing fussie make him stop she gets the paper by tearing it horace my dad s around here showing the college off to a politician if you don t come across with that sheet of mystery i ll back you both out there starts to do it and doris horace you re just horrid horace sure i m horrid that s the way i want to be takes the paper reads to eben you are the idol of my dreams i worship from afar what is this fussie now listen horace and don t you tell you know eben weeks he s the homeliest man in school wouldn t you say so horace awful jay like to get some of the jays out of here doris but listen of course no girl would look at him so we ve thought up the most killing joke stopped by giggles from herself and fussie now he hasn t handed in his matthew arnold dope i heard old mac hold him up for it and what d you think he said that he d been ploughing said he was trying to run a farm and go to college at the same time isn t it a scream horace we oughta make it more unpleasant for some of those jays gives the school a bad name fussie but listen horace honest you ll just die he said he was going to get the book this afternoon now you know what he looks like but he turns to both girls are convulsed doris it ll get him all fussed up and for nothing at all horace too bad that class of people come here i think i ll go to harvard next year haven t broken it to my parents but i ve about made up my mind doris don t you think morton s a good school horace horace morton s all right fine for the kindly people who would naturally come here but one gets an acquaintance at harvard wher d y want these passionate lines fussie and doris are off again convulsed horace eye falling on the page where he opens the book say old bones could spill the english what listen to this flyer for when we say that culture is to know the best that has been thought and said in the world we simply imply that for culture a system directly tending to that end is necessary in our reading he reads it with mock solemnity delighting fussie and doris the best that has been thought and said in the world madeline morton comes in from right she carries a tennis racket madeline both critical and good humoured you haven t made a large contribution to that have you horace horace madeline you don t want to let this sarcastic habit grow on you madeline thanks for the tip fussie oh madeline holds out her hand to take the book from horace and shows it to madeline you know doris s h don t be silly to cover this who you playing with horace want me to play with you madeline madeline genially i d rather play with you than talk to you horace same here fussie aren t cousins affectionate madeline moving through to the other part of the library but first i m looking for a book horace well i can tell you without your looking it up he did say it but that was an age of different values anyway the fact that they re quoting it shows it s being misapplied madeline smiling father said so horace on his dignity oh of course if you don t want to be serious madeline laughs and passes on through doris what are you two talking about horace madeline happened to overhear a little discussion down on the campus fussie listen you know something sometimes i think madeline morton is a highbrow in disguise horace say you don t want to start anything like that madeline s all right she and i treat each other rough but that s being in the family fussie well i ll tell you something i heard professor holden say madeline morton has a great deal more mind than she d let herself know horace oh well holden he s erratic look at how popular madeline is doris i should say what s the matter with you fussie fussie oh i didn t mean it really hurt her horace guess it don t hurt her much at a dance say what s this new jazz they were springing last night doris i know now look here horace l me show you she shows him a step horace i get you he begins to dance with her the book he holds slips to the floor he kicks it under the table fussie be careful they ll be coming back here glances off left doris keep an eye out fussie fussie from her post they re coming i tell you they re coming doris horace come on he teasingly keeps hold of her continuing the dance at sound of voices they run off right fussie considers rescuing the book decides she has not time senator at first speaking off yes it could be done there is that surplus and as long as morton college is socially valuable right here above the steel works and making this feature of military training he has picked up his hat but your americanism must be unimpeachable mr fejevary this man holden stands in the way fejevary i m going to have a talk with professor holden this afternoon if he remains he will it is not easy for him to say give no trouble madeline returns oh here s madeline silas morton s granddaughter madeline fejevary morton this is senator lewis madeline senator holding out his hand how do you do miss morton i suppose this is a great day for you madeline why i don t know senator the fortieth anniversary of the founding of your grandfather s college you must be very proud of your illustrious ancestor madeline i get a bit bored with him senator bored with him my dear young lady madeline i suppose because i ve heard so many speeches about him the sainted pioneer the grand old man of the prairies i m sure i haven t any idea what he really was like fejevary i ve tried to tell you madeline madeline yes senator i should think you would be proud to be the granddaughter of this man of vision madeline her smile flashing wouldn t you hate to be the granddaughter of a phrase fejevary trying to laugh it off madeline how absurd madeline well i m off for tennis nods good bye and passes on fejevary calling to her oh madeline if your aunt isabel is out there will you tell her where we are madeline calling back all right fejevary after a look at his companion queer girl madeline rather moody senator disapprovingly well yes fejevary again trying to laugh it off she s been hearing a great many speeches about her grandfather senator she should be proud to hear them fejevary of course she should looking in the direction madeline has gone i want you to meet my wife senator lewis senator i should be pleased to meet mrs fejevary i have heard what she means to the college socially fejevary i think she has given it something it wouldn t have had without her certainly a place in the town that is good for it and you haven t met our president yet senator guess i ve met the real president fejevary oh no i m merely president of the board of trustees senator merely fejevary i want you to know president welling he s very much the cultivated gentleman senator cultivated gentlemen are all right i d hate to see a world they ran fejevary with a laugh i ll just take a look up here then we can go down the shorter way he goes out right senator lewis turns and examines the books fussie slips in looks at him hesitates and then stoops under the table for the matthew arnold and her poem which horace has kicked there he turns fussie not out from under the table oh i was just looking for a book senator quite a place to look for a book fussie crawling out yes it got there i thought i d put it back somebody might want it senator i see young lady that you have a regard for books fussie oh yes i do have a regard for them senator holding out his hand and what is your book fussie oh it s it s nothing as he continues to hold out his hand she reluctantly gives the book senator solemnly matthew arnold nothing fussie oh i didn t mean him senator a master of english i am glad young woman that you value this book fussie oh yes i m awfully fond of it growing more and more nervous as in turning the pages he nears the poem senator i am interested in you young people of morton college fussie that s so good of you senator what is your favourite

the book back holding out her hand senator no i ll just look it over a bit sits down fussie unable to think of any way of getting it this is where it belongs senator thank you reluctantly she goes out senator lewis pursues matthew arnold with the conscious air of a half literate man reading a great book the fejevarys come in fejevary i found my wife senator lewis aunt isabel she is a woman of social distinction and charm how do you do senator lewis they shake hands senator it s a great pleasure to meet you mrs fejevary aunt isabel why don t we carry senator lewis home for lunch senator why you re very kind aunt isabel i m sure there s a great deal to talk about so why not talk comfortably and really get acquainted and we want to tell you the whole story of morton college the good old american spirit behind it senator i am glad to find you an american mrs fejevary aunt isabel oh we are that morton college is one hundred per cent american our boys her boy horace rushes in horace wildly father will you go after madeline the police have got her fejevary what aunt isabel as he is getting his breath what absurd thing are you saying horace horace awful row down on the campus the hindus i told them to keep their mouths shut about abraham lincoln i told them the fact they were quoting him fejevary never mind what you told them what happened horace we started to rustle them along a bit why they had handbills holding one up as if presenting incriminating evidence the senator takes it from him telling america what to do about deportation not on this campus i say so we were we were putting a stop to it they resisted particularly the fat one the cop at the corner saw the row came up he took hold of bakhshish and when the dirty anarchist didn t move along fast enough he took hold of him well a bit rough you might say when up rushes madeline and calls to the cop let that boy alone gee i don t know just what did happen awful mix up next thing i knew madeline hauled off and pasted the policeman a fierce one with her tennis racket senator she struck the officer horace i should say she did twice the second time aunt isabel horace looking at her husband i i can t believe it horace i could have squared it even then but for madeline herself i told the policeman that she didn t understand that i was her cousin and apologized for her and she called over at me better apologize for yourself as if there was any sense to that that she she looked like a tiger honest everybody was afraid of her i kept right on trying to square it told the cop she was the granddaughter of the man that founded the college that you were her uncle he would have gone off with just the hindu fixed this up later but madeline balled it up again didn t care who was her uncle gee he throws open the window there you can see them at the foot of the hill a nice thing member of our family led off to the police station fejevary to the senator will you excuse me aunt isabel trying to return to the manner of pleasant social things senator lewis will go on home with me and you he is hurrying out come when you can to the senator madeline is such a high spirited girl senator if she had no regard for the living she might on this day of all others have considered her grandfather s memory raises his eyes to the picture of silas morton horace gee wouldn t you say so curtain act iii scene the same as act ii three hours later professor holden is seated at the table books before him he is a man in the fifties at the moment his care worn face is lighted by that lift of the spirit which sometimes rewards the scholar who has imaginative feeling harry a student clerk comes hurrying in looks back harry here s professor holden mr fejevary holden mr fejevary is looking for me harry yes he goes back a moment later mr fejevary enters he has his hat gloves stick seems tired and disturbed holden was i mistaken i thought our appointment was for five fejevary quite right but things have changed so i wondered if i might have a little talk with you now holden to be sure rising shall we go downstairs fejevary i don t know nice and quiet up here to harry who is now passing through harry the library is closed now is it harry yes it s locked fejevary and there s no one in here harry no i ve been all through fejevary there s a committee downstairs oh this is a terrible day putting his things on the table we d better stay up here harry when my niece when miss morton arrives i want you to come and let me know ask her not to leave the building without seeing me harry yes sir he goes out fejevary well wearily it s been a day not the day i was looking for holden no fejevary you re very serene up here holden yes i wanted to be serene for a little while fejevary looking at the books emerson whitman with a smile have they anything new to say on economics holden perhaps not but i wanted to forget economics for a time i came up here by myself to try and celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the founding of morton college answering the other man s look yes i confess i ve been disappointed in the anniversary as i left memorial hall after the exercises this morning emerson s words came into my mind give me truth for i am tired of surfaces and die of inanition well then i went home stops troubled fejevary how is mrs holden holden better thank you but not strong fejevary she needs the very best of care for a time doesn t she holden yes silent a moment then this is something more than the fortieth anniversary you know it s the first of the month fejevary and illness hasn t reduced the bills holden shaking his head i didn t want this day to go like that so i came up here to try and touch what used to be here fejevary but you speak despondently of us and there s been such a fine note of optimism in the exercises speaks with the heartiness of one who would keep himself assured holden i didn t seem to want a fine note of optimism with roughness i wanted a gleam from reality fejevary to me this is reality the robust spirit created by all these young people holden do you think it is robust hand affectionately on the book before him i ve been reading whitman fejevary this day has to be itself certain things go others come life is change holden perhaps it s myself i m discouraged with do you remember the tenth anniversary of the founding of morton college fejevary the tenth oh yes that was when this library was opened holden i shall never forget your father mr fejevary as he stood out there and said the few words which gave these books to the students not many books but he seemed to baptize them in the very spirit from which books are born fejevary he died the following year holden one felt death near but that didn t seem the important thing a student who had fought for liberty for mind of course his face would be sensitive you must be very proud of your heritage fejevary yes a little testily well i have certainly worked for the college i m doing my best now to keep it a part of these times holden as if this has not reached him it was later that same afternoon i talked with silas morton we stood at this window and looked out over the valley to the lower hill that was his home he told me how from that hill he had for years looked up to this one and why there had to be a college here i never felt america as that old farmer made me feel it fejevary drawn by this then shifting in irritation because he is drawn i m sorry to break in with practical things but alas i am a practical man forced to be i too have made a fight though the fight to finance never appears an idealistic one but i m deep in that now and i must have a little help at least i must not have stumbling blocks holden am i a stumbling block fejevary candidly with a smile you are a little hard to finance here s the situation the time for being a little college has passed we must take our place as one of the important colleges i make bold to say one of the important universities of the middle west but we have to enlarge before we can grow answering holden s smile yes it is ironic but that s the way of it it was a nice thing to open the anniversary with fifty thousand from the steel works but fifty thousand dollars nowadays to an institution waves the fifty thousand aside they ll do more later i think when they see us coming into our own meanwhile as you know there s this chance for an appropriation from the state i find that the legislature the members who count are very friendly to morton college they like the spirit we have here well now i come to you and you are one of the big reasons for my wanting to put this over your salary makes me blush it s all wrong that a man like you should have these petty worries particularly with mrs holden so in need of the things a little money can do now this man lewis is a reactionary so naturally he doesn t approve of you holden so naturally i am to go fejevary go not at all what have i just been saying holden be silent then fejevary not that either not not really but be a little more discreet seeing him harden this is what i want to put up to you why not give things a chance to mature in your own mind candidly i don t feel you know just what you do think is it so awfully important to express confusion holden the only man who knows just what he thinks at the present moment is the man who hasn t done any new thinking in the past ten years fejevary with a soothing gesture you and i needn t quarrel about it i understand you but i find it a little hard to interpret you to a man like lewis holden then why not let a man like lewis go to thunder fejevary and let the college go to thunder i m not willing to do that i ve made a good many sacrifices for this college given more money than i could afford to give given time and thought that i could have used for personal gain holden that s true i know fejevary i don t know just why i ve done it sentiment i suppose i had a very strong feeling about my father professor holden and this friend silas morton this college is the child of that friendship those are noble words in our manifesto morton college was born because there came to this valley a man who held his vision for mankind above his own advantage and because that man found in this valley a man who wanted beauty for his fellow men as he wanted no other thing holden taking it up born of the fight for freedom and the aspiration to richer living we believe that morton college rising as from the soil itself may strengthen all those here and everywhere who fight for the life there is in freedom and may to the measure it can loosen for america the beauty that breathes from knowledge moved by the words he has spoken do you know i would rather do that really do that than grow big fejevary yes but you see or rather what you don t see is you have to look at the world in which you find yourself the only way to stay alive is to grow big it s been hard but i have tried to carry on holden and so have i tried to carry on but it is very hard carrying on a dream fejevary well i m trying to make it easier holden make it easier by destroying the dream fejevary not at all what i want is scope for dreams holden are you sure we d have the dreams after we ve paid this price for the scope fejevary now let s not get rhetorical with one another holden mr fejevary you have got to let me be as honest with you as you say you are being with me you have got to let me say what i feel fejevary certainly that s why i wanted this talk with you holden you say you have made sacrifices for morton college so have i fejevary how well i know that holden you don t know all of it i m not sure you understand any of it fejevary charmingly oh i think you re hard on me holden i spoke of the tenth anniversary i was a young man then just home from athens pulled back into an old feeling i don t know why i felt i had to go to greece i knew then that i was going to teach something within sociology and i didn t want anything i felt about beauty to be left out of what i formulated about society the greeks fejevary as holden has paused before what he sees i remember you told me the greeks were the passion of your student days holden not so much because they created beauty but because they were able to let beauty flow into their lives to create themselves in beauty so as a romantic young man smiles it seemed if i could go where they had been what i had felt might take form anyway i had a wonderful time there oh what wouldn t i give to have again that feeling of life s infinite possibilities fejevary nodding a youthful feeling holden softly i like youth well i was just back visiting my sister here at the time of the tenth anniversary i had a chance then to go to harvard as instructor a good chance for i would have been under a man who liked me but that afternoon i heard your father speak about books i talked with silas morton i found myself telling him about greece no one had ever felt it as he felt it it seemed to become of the very bone of him fejevary affectionately i know how he used to do holden he put his hands on my shoulders he said young man don t go away we need you here give us this great thing you ve got and so i stayed for i felt that here was soil in which i could grow and that one s whole life was not too much to give to a place with roots like that a little bitterly forgive me if this seems rhetoric fejevary a gesture of protest silent a moment you make it hard for me with exasperation don t you think i d like to indulge myself in an exalted mood and why don t i i can t afford it not now won t you have a little patience and faith faith that the thing we want will be there for us after we ve worked our way through the woods we are in the woods now it s going to take our combined brains to get us out i don t mean just morton college holden no america as to getting out i think you are all wrong fejevary that s one of your sweeping statements holden nobody s all wrong even you aren t holden and in what ways am i wrong from the standpoint of your senator lewis fejevary he s not my senator lewis he s the state s and we have to take him as he is why he objects of course to your radical activities he spoke of your defence of conscientious objectors holden slowly i think a man who is willing to go to prison for what he believes has stuff in him no college needs turn its back on fejevary well he doesn t agree with you nor do i holden still quietly and i think a society which permits things to go on which i can prove go on in our federal prisons had better stop and take a fresh look at itself to stand for that and then talk of democracy and idealism oh it shows no mentality for one thing fejevary easily i presume the prisons do need a cleaning up as to fred jordan you can t expect me to share your admiration our own fred my nephew fred morton went to france and gave his life there s some little courage holden in doing that holden i m not trying to belittle it but he had the whole spirit of his age with him fortunate boy the man who stands outside the idealism of this time fejevary takes a good deal upon himself i should say holden there isn t any other such loneliness you know in your heart it s a noble courage fejevary it lacks humility holden laughs scoffingly and i think you lack it i m asking you to co operate with me for the good of morton college holden why not do it the other way you say enlarge that we may grow that s false it isn t of the nature of growth why not do it the way of silas morton and walt whitman each man being his purest and intensest self i was full of this fervour when you came in i m more and more disappointed in our students they re empty flippant no sensitive moment opens them to beauty no exaltation makes them what they hadn t known they were i concluded some of the fault must be mine the only students i reach are the hindus perhaps madeline morton i don t quite make her out i too must have gone into a dead stratum but i can get back here alone this afternoon softly i was back fejevary i think we ll have to let the hindus go holden astonished go our best students fejevary this college is for americans i m not going to have foreign revolutionists come here and block the things i ve spent my life working for holden i don t seem to know what you mean at all fejevary why that disgraceful performance this morning i can settle madeline all right looking at his watch she should be here by now but i m convinced our case before the legislature will be stronger with the hindus out of here holden well i seem to have missed something disgraceful performance the hindus madeline stops bewildered fejevary you mean to say you don t know about the disturbance out here holden i went right home after the address then came up here alone fejevary upon my word you do lead a serene life while you ve been sitting here in contemplation i ve been to the police court trying to get my niece out of jail that s what comes of having radicals around holden what happened fejevary one of our beloved hindus made himself obnoxious on the campus giving out handbills about freedom for india howling over deportation our american boys wouldn t stand for it a policeman saw the fuss came up and started to put the hindu in his place then madeline rushes in and it ended in her pounding the policeman with her tennis racket holden madeline morton did that fejevary sharply you seem pleased holden i am interested fejevary well i m not interested i m disgusted my niece mixing up in a free for all fight and getting taken to the police station it s the first disgrace we ve ever had in our family holden as one who has been given courage wasn t there another disgrace fejevary what do you mean holden when your father fought his government and was banished from his country fejevary that was not a disgrace holden as if in surprise wasn t it fejevary see here holden you can t talk to me like that holden i don t admit you can talk to me as you please and that i can t talk to you i m a professor not a servant fejevary yes and you re a damned difficult professor i certainly have tried to holden smiling handle me fejevary i ask you this do you know any other institution where you could sit and talk with the executive head as you have here with me holden i don t know perhaps not fejevary then be reasonable no one is entirely free that s na ve it s rather egotistical to want to be we re held by our relations to others by our obligations to the vaguely the ultimate thing come now you admit certain dissatisfactions with yourself so why not go with intensity into just the things you teach and not touch quite so many other things holden i couldn t teach anything if i didn t feel free to go wherever that thing took me thirty years ago i was asked to come to this college precisely because my science was not in isolation because of my vivid feeling of us as a moment in a long sweep because of my faith in the greater beauty our further living may unfold harry enters harry excuse me miss morton is here now mr fejevary fejevary frowns hesitates ask her to come up here in five minutes after harry has gone i think we ve thrown a scare into madeline i thought as long as she d been taken to jail it would be no worse for us to have her stay there awhile she s been held since one o clock that ought to teach her reason holden is there a case against her fejevary no i got it fixed up explained that it was just college girl foolishness wouldn t happen again one reason i wanted this talk with you first if i do have any trouble with madeline i want you to help me holden oh i can t do that fejevary you aren t running out and clubbing the police tell her she ll have to think things over and express herself with a little more dignity holden i ask to be excused from being present while you talk with her fejevary but why not stay in the library in case i should need you just take your books over to the east alcove and go on with what you were doing when i came in holden with a faint smile i fear i can hardly do that as to madeline fejevary you don t want to see the girl destroy herself do you i confess i ve always worried about madeline if my sister had lived but madeline s mother died you know when she was a baby her father well you and i talked that over just the other day there s no getting to him fred never worried me a bit just the fine normal boy but madeline with an effort throwing it off oh it ll be all right i haven t a doubt and it ll be all right between you and me won t it caution over a hard strip of the road then bigger things ahead holden slowly knowing what it may mean i shall continue to do all i can toward getting fred jordan out of prison it s a disgrace to america that two years after the war closes he should be kept there much of the time in solitary confinement because he couldn t believe in war it s small vengeful it s the russia of the czars i shall do what is in my power to fight the deportation of gurkul singh and certainly i shall leave no stone unturned if you persist in your amazing idea of dismissing the other hindus from college for what i ask you dismissed for what because they love liberty enough to give their lives to it the day you dismiss them burn our high sounding manifesto mr fejevary and admit that morton college now sells her soul to the committee on appropriations fejevary well you force me to be as specific as you are if you do these things i can no longer fight for you holden very well then i go fejevary go where holden i don t know at the moment fejevary i fear you ll find it harder than you know meanwhile what of your family holden we will have to manage some way fejevary it is not easy for a woman whose health in fact whose life is a matter of the best of care to manage some way with real feeling what is an intellectual position alongside that reality you d like of course to be just what you want to be but isn t there something selfish in that satisfaction i m talking as a friend now you must know that you and i have a good many ties holden i don t believe you know how much mrs fejevary thinks of mrs holden holden she has been very very good to her fejevary and will be she cares for her and our children have been growing up together i love to watch it isn t that the reality doing for them as best we can making sacrifices of of every kind don t let some tenuous remote thing destroy this flesh and blood thing holden as one fighting to keep his head above water honesty is not a tenuous remote thing fejevary there s a kind of honesty in selfishness we can t always have it oh i used to go through things but i ve struck a pace one does and goes ahead holden forgive me but i don t think you ve had certain temptations to selfishness fejevary how do you know what i ve had you have no way of knowing what s in me what other thing i might have been you know my heritage you think that s left nothing but i find myself here in america i love those dependent on me my wife who s used to a certain manner of living my children who are to become part of the america of their time i ve never said this to another human being i ve never looked at myself but it s pretty arrogant to think you re the only man who has made a sacrifice to fit himself into the age in which he lives i hear madeline this hasn t left me in very good form for talking with her please don t go away just madeline comes in right she has her tennis racket nods to the two men holden goes out left madeline looking after holden feeling something going on then turning to her uncle who is still looking after holden you wanted to speak to me uncle felix fejevary of course i want to speak to you madeline i feel just awfully sorry about banging up my racket like this the second time it came down on this club why do they carry those things perfectly fantastic i ll say going around with a club but as long as you were asking me what i wanted for my birthday fejevary madeline i am not here to discuss your birthday madeline i m sorry smiles to hear that fejevary you don t seem much chastened madeline chastened was that the idea well if you think that keeping a person where she doesn t want to be chastens her i never felt less chastened than when i walked out of that slimy spot and looked across the street at your nice bank i should think you d hate to with friendly concern why uncle felix you look tired out fejevary i am tired out madeline i ve had a nerve racking day madeline isn t that too bad those speeches were so boresome and that old senator person wasn t he a stuff but can t you go home now and let auntie give you tea and fejevary sharply madeline have you no intelligence hasn t it occurred to you that your performance would worry me a little madeline i suppose it was a nuisance and on such a busy day changing but if you re going to worry horace is the one you should worry about answering his look why he got it all up he made me ashamed fejevary and you re not at all ashamed of what you have done madeline ashamed why no fejevary then you d better be a girl who rushes in and assaults an officer madeline earnestly explaining it but uncle felix i had to stop him no one else did fejevary madeline i don t know whether you re trying to be na ve madeline angrily well i m not i like that i think i ll go home fejevary i think you will not it s stupid of you not to know this is serious you could be dismissed from school for what you did madeline well i m good and ready to be dismissed from any school that would dismiss for that fejevary in a new manner quietly from feeling madeline have you no love for this place madeline doggedly after thinking yes i have she sits down and i don t know why i have fejevary certainly it s not strange if ever a girl had a background morton college is madeline fejevary morton s background he too now seated by the table do you remember your grandfather morton madeline not very well a quality which seems sullenness i couldn t bear to look at him he shook so fejevary turning away real pain oh how cruel madeline surprised gently cruel me cruel fejevary not just you the way it passes to himself so fast it passes madeline i m sorry troubled you see he was too old then fejevary his hand up to stop her i wish i could bring him back for a moment so you could see what he was before he bitterly shook so he was a powerful man who was as real as the earth he was strangely of the earth as if something went from it to him looking at her intently queer you should be the one to have no sentiment about him for you and he sometimes when i m with you it s as if he were near he had no personal ambition madeline he was ambitious for the earth and its people i wonder if you can realize what it meant to my father in a strange land where he might so easily have been misunderstood pushed down to find a friend like that it wasn t so much the material things though uncle silas was always making them right and as if oh hardly conscious what he was doing so little it mattered it was the way he got father and by that very valuing kept alive what was there to value why he literally laid this country at my father s feet as if that was what this country was for as if it made up for the hard early things for the wrong things madeline he must really have been a pretty nice old party no doubt i would have hit it off with him all right i don t seem to hit it off with the speeches about him somehow i want to say oh give us a rest fejevary offended and that i presume is what you want to say to me madeline no no i didn t mean you uncle though hesitatingly i was wondering how you could think you were talking on your side fejevary what do you mean my side madeline oh i don t exactly that s nice about him being of the earth sometimes when i m out for a tramp way off by myself yes i know and i wonder if that doesn t explain his feeling about the indians father told me how grandfather took it to heart about the indians fejevary he felt it as you d feel it if it were your brother so he must give his choicest land to the thing we might become then maybe i can lie under the same sod with the red boys and not be ashamed madeline nods appreciatively madeline yes that s really all right fejevary irritated by what seems charily stated approval all right well i am not willing to let this man s name pass from our time and it seems rather bitter that silas morton s granddaughter should be the one to stand in my way madeline why uncle felix i m not standing in your way of course i wouldn t do that i rather bashfully i love the hill i was thinking about it in jail i got fuddled on direction in there so i asked the woman who hung around which way was college hill right through there she said a blank wall i sat and looked through that wall long time she looks front again looking through that blank wall it was all kind of funny then later she came and told me you were out there and i thought it was corking of you to come and tell them they couldn t put that over on college hill and i know bakhshish will appreciate it too i wonder where he went fejevary went i fancy he won t go much of anywhere to night madeline what do you mean fejevary why he s held for this hearing of course madeline you mean you came and got just me and left him there fejevary certainly madeline rising then i ll have to go and get him fejevary madeline don t be so absurd you don t get people out of jail by stopping in and calling for them madeline but you got me fejevary because of years of influence at that it wasn t simple things of this nature are pretty serious nowadays it was only your ignorance got you out madeline i do seem ignorant while you were fixing it up for me why didn t you arrange for him too fejevary because i am not in the business of getting foreign revolutionists out of jail madeline but he didn t do as much as i did fejevary it isn t what he did it s what he is we don t want him here madeline well i guess i m not for that fejevary may i ask why you have appointed yourself guardian of these strangers madeline perhaps because they are strangers fejevary well they re the wrong kind of strangers madeline is it true that the hindu who was here last year is to be deported is america going to turn him over to the government he fought fejevary i have an idea they will all be deported i m not so sorry this thing happened it will get them into the courts and i don t think they have money to fight madeline giving it clean and straight gee i think that s rotten fejevary quite likely your inelegance will not affect it one way or the other madeline she has taken her seat again is thinking it out i m twenty one next tuesday isn t it on my twenty first birthday i get that money grandfather morton left me fejevary what are you driving at madeline simply they can have my money fejevary are you crazy what are these people to you madeline they re people from the other side of the world who came here believing in us drawn from the far side of the world by things we say about ourselves well i m going to pretend just for fun that the things we say about ourselves are true so if you ll arrange so i can get it uncle felix as soon as it s mine fejevary and this is what you say to me at the close of my years of trusteeship if you could know how i ve nursed that little legacy along until now it is breaking off in anger i shall not permit you to destroy yourself madeline quietly i don t see how you can keep me from destroying myself fejevary looking at her seeing that this may be true in genuine amazement and hurt why but it s incredible have i has my house been nothing to you all these years madeline i ve had my best times at your house things wouldn t have been very gay for me without you all though horace gets my goat fejevary and does your aunt isabel get your goat madeline i love auntie rather resentfully you know that what has that got to do with it fejevary so you are going to use silas morton s money to knife his college madeline oh uncle felix that s silly fejevary it s a long way from silly you know a little about what i m trying to do this appropriation that would assure our future if silas morton s granddaughter casts in her lot with revolutionists morton college will get no help from the state do you know enough about what you are doing to assume this responsibility madeline i am not casting in my lot with revolutionists if it s true as you say that you have to have money in order to get justice fejevary i didn t say it madeline why you did uncle felix you said so and if it s true that these strangers in our country are going to be abused because they re poor what else could i do with my money and not feel like a skunk fejevary trying a different tack laughing oh you re a romantic girl madeline skunk and all rather nice at that but the thing is perfectly fantastic from every standpoint you speak as if you had millions and if you did it wouldn t matter not really you are going against the spirit of this country with or without money that can t be done take a man like professor holden he s radical in his sympathies but does he run out and club the police madeline in a smouldering way i thought america was a democracy fejevary we have just fought a great war for democracy madeline well is that any reason for not having it fejevary i should think you would have a little emotion about the war about america when you consider where your brother is madeline fred had all kinds of reasons for going to france he wanted a trip answering his exclamation why he said so heavens fred didn t make speeches about himself wanted to see paris poor kid he never did see paris wanted to be with a lot of fellows knock the kaiser s block off end war get a french girl it was all mixed up the way things are but fred was a pretty decent sort i ll say so he had such kind honest eyes this has somehow said itself her own eyes close and what her shut eyes see makes feeling hot one thing i do know fred never went over the top and out to back up the argument you re making now fejevary stiffly very well i will discontinue the argument i m making now i ve been trying to save you from pretty serious things the regret of having stood in the way of morton college his voice falling the horror of having driven your father insane madeline what fejevary one more thing would do it just the other day i was talking with professor holden about your father his idea of him relates back to the pioneer life another price paid for this country the lives back of him were too hard your great grandmother morton the first white woman in this region she dared too much was too lonely feared and bore too much they did it for the task gave them a courage for the task but it left a scar madeline and father is that can hardly say it scar fighting the idea but grandfather morton was not like that fejevary no he had the vision of the future he was robust with feeling for others gently but holden feels your father is the dwarfed pioneer child the way he concentrates on corn excludes all else as if unable to free himself from their old battle with the earth madeline almost crying i think it s pretty terrible to wish all that on poor father fejevary well my dear child it s life has wished it on him it s just one other way of paying the price for his country we needn t get it for nothing i feel that all our chivalry should go to your father in his heritage of loneliness madeline father couldn t always have been dwarfed mother wouldn t have cared for him if he had always been like that fejevary no if he could have had love to live in but no endurance for losing it too much had been endured just before life got to him madeline do you know uncle felix i m afraid that s true he nods sometimes when i m with father i feel those things near the the too much the too hard feel them as you d feel the cold and now that it s different easier he can t come into the world that s been earned oh i wish i could help him as they sit there together now for the first time really together there is a shrill shout of derision from outside madeline what s that a whistled call horace that s horace s call that s for his gang are they going to start something now that will get atma in jail fejevary more likely he s trying to start something they are both listening intently i don t think our boys will stand much more a scoffing whoop madeline springs to the window he reaches it ahead and holds it fejevary this window stays closed she starts to go away he takes hold of her madeline you think you can keep me in here fejevary listen madeline plain straight truth if you go out there and get in trouble a second time i can t make it right for you madeline you needn t fejevary you don t know what it means these things are not child s play not today you could get twenty years in prison for things you ll say if you rush out there now she laughs you laugh because you re ignorant do you know that in america today there are women in our prisons for saying no more than you ve said here to me madeline then you ought to be ashamed of yourself fejevary i ashamed of myself madeline yes aren t you an american a whistle isn t that a policeman s whistle are they coming back are they hanging around here to pulling away from her uncle as he turns to look she jumps up in the deep sill and throws open the window calling down here officer you let that boy alone fejevary going left calling sharply holden professor holden here quick voice coming up from below outside who says so madeline i say so voice and who are you talking for madeline i am talking for morton college fejevary returning followed reluctantly by holden indeed you are not close that window or you ll be expelled from morton college sounds of a growing crowd outside voice didn t i see you at the station madeline sure you saw me at the station and you ll see me there again if you come bullying around here you re not what this place is for her uncle comes up behind right and tries to close the window she holds it out my grandfather gave this hill to morton college a place where anybody from any land can come and say what he believes to be true why you poor simp this is america beat it from here atna don t let him take hold of you like that he has no right to oh let me down there springs down would go off right her uncle spreads out his arms to block that passage she turns to go the other way fejevary holden bring her to her senses stand there holden has not moved from the place he entered left and so blocks the doorway don t let her pass shouts of derision outside madeline you think you can keep me in here with that going on out there moves nearer holden stands there before him taut looking him straight in the eye after a moment slowly as one compelled he steps aside for her to pass sound of her running footsteps the two men s eyes meet a door slams curtain act iv scene at the morton place the same room in which silas morton told his friend felix fejevary of his plan for the hill the room has not altogether changed since that day in the table around which they dreamed for the race is in its old place one of the old chairs is there the other two are modern chairs in a corner is the rocker in which grandmother morton sat this is early afternoon a week after the events of act ii madeline is sitting at the table in her hand a torn wrinkled piece of brown paper peering at writing almost too fine to read after a moment her hand goes out to a beautiful dish on the table an old dish of coloured hungarian glass she is about to take something from this but instead lets her hand rest an instant on the dish itself then turns and through the open door looks out at the hill sitting where her grandfather morton sat when he looked out at the hill her father ira morton appears outside walking past the window left he enters carrying a grain sack partly filled he seems hardly aware of madeline but taking a chair near the door turned from her opens the sack and takes out a couple of ears of corn as he is bent over them examining in a shrewd greedy way madeline looks at that lean tormented rather desperate profile the look of one confirming a thing she fears then takes up her piece of paper madeline do you remember fred jordan father friend of our fred and of mine ira not wanting to take his mind from the corn no i don t remember him his voice has that timbre of one not related to others madeline he s in prison now ira well i can t help that after taking out another ear this is the best corn i ever had he says it gloatingly to himself madeline he got this letter out to me written on this scrap of paper they don t give him paper peering written so fine i can hardly read it he s in what they call the hold father a punishment cell with difficulty reading it it s two and a half feet at one end three feet at the other and six feet long he d been there ten days when he wrote this he gets two slices of bread a day he gets water that s all he gets this because he balled the deputy warden out for chaining another prisoner up by the wrists ira well he d better a minded his own business and you better mind yours i ve got no money to spend in the courts with excitement i ll not mortgage this farm it s been clear since the day my father s father got it from the government and it stays clear till i m gone it grows the best corn in the state best corn in the mississippi valley not for anything you hear me would i mortgage this farm my father handed down to me madeline hurt well father i m not asking you to ira then go and see your uncle felix make it up with him he ll help you if you say you re sorry madeline i ll not go to uncle felix ira who will you go to then pause who will help you then again he waits you come before this united states commissioner with no one behind you he ll hold you for the grand jury judge watkins told felix there s not a doubt of it you know what that means it means you re on your way to a cell nice thing for a morton people who ve had their own land since we got it from the indians what s the matter with your uncle ain t he always been good to you i d like to know what things would a been for you without felix and isabel and all their friends you want to think a little you like good times too well to throw all that away madeline i do like good times so does fred jordan like good times smooths the wrinkled paper i don t know anybody unless it is myself loves to be out as he does she tries to look out but can not sits very still seeing what it is pain to see rises goes to that corner closet the same one from which silas morton took the deed to the hill she gets a yard stick looks in a box and finds a piece of chalk on the floor she marks off fred jordan s cell slowly at the end left unchalked as for a door she goes in her hand goes up as against a wall looks at her other hand sees it is out too far brings it in giving herself the width of the cell walks its length halts looks up and one window too high up to see out in the moment she stands there she is in that cell she is all the people who are in those cells emil johnson appears from outside he is the young man brought up on a farm a crudely americanized swede madeline stepping out of the cell door and around it hello emil emil how are you madeline how do mr morton ira barely nods and does not turn in an excited manner he begins gathering up the corn he has taken from the sack emil turns back to madeline well i m just from the courthouse looks like you and i might take a ride together madeline you come before the commissioner at four ira what have you got to do with it madeline oh emil has a courthouse job now father he s part of the law ira well he s not going to take you to the law anybody else not emil johnson madeline astonished and gently to make up for his rudeness why father why not emil since i m going i think it s nice to go in with someone i know with a neighbour like emil ira if this is what he lived for if this is why he twists the ear of corn until some of the kernels drip off madeline and emil look at one another in bewilderment emil it s too bad anybody has to take madeline in i should think your uncle could fix it up low and with your father taking it like this to help ira that s fine corn mr morton my corn s getting better all the time but i d like to get some of this for seed ira rising and turning on him you get my corn i raise this corn for you not to them his mind now going where it is shut off from any other mind if i could make the wind stand still i want to turn the wind around madeline going to him why father i don t understand at all ira don t understand nobody understands a curse with a sob in it god damn the wind sits down his back to them emil after a silence well i ll go but he continues to look at ira who is holding the sack of com shut as if someone may take it too bad stopped by a sign from madeline not to speak of it well i was saying i have go on to beard s crossing i ll stop for you on my way back confidentially couldn t you telephone your uncle he could do something you don t know what you re going up against you heard what the hindus got i suppose madeline no i haven t seen anyone to day emil they re held for the grand jury they re locked up now no bail for them i ve got the inside dope about them they re going to get what this country can hand em then after we ve given them a nice little taste of prison life in america they re going to be sent back home to see what india can treat them to madeline why are you so pleased about this emil emil pleased it s nothin to me i m just telling you guess you don t know much about the espionage act or you d go and make a little friendly call on your uncle when your case comes to trial and judge lenon may be on the bench whistles he s one fiend for americanism but if your uncle was to tell the right parties that you re just a girl and didn t realize what you were saying madeline i did realize what i was saying and every word you ve just said makes me know i meant what i said i said if this was what our country has come to then i m not for our country i said that and a plenty more and i ll say it again emil well gee you don t know what it means madeline i do know what it means but it means not being a coward emil oh well lord you can t say everything you think if everybody did that things d be worse off than they are now madeline once in a while you have to say what you think or hate yourself emil with a grin then hate yourself madeline smiling too no thank you it spoils my fun emil well look a here madeline aren t you spoiling your fun now you re a girl who liked to be out ain t i seen you from our place with this one and that one sometimes all by yourself strikin out over the country as if you was crazy about it how d you like to be where you couldn t even see out madeline a step nearer the cell there oughtn t to be such places emil oh well jesus if you re going to talk about that you can t change the way things are madeline quietly why can t i emil well say who do you think you are madeline i think i m an american and for that reason i think i have something to say about america emil huh america ll lock you up for your pains madeline all right if it s come to that maybe i d rather be a locked up american than a free american emil i don t think you d like the place madeline there s not much tennis played there jesus what s hindus madeline you aren t really asking jesus are you emil smiles you mightn t like his answer emil from the door take a tip telephone your uncle he goes ira not looking at her there might be a fine and they d come down on me and take my land madeline oh no father i think not anyway i have a little money of my own grandfather morton left me something have you forgotten that ira no no i know he left you something the words seem to bother him i know he left you something madeline i get it to day wistfully this is my birthday father i m twenty one ira your birthday twenty one in pain was that twenty one years ago it is not to his daughter this has turned him madeline it s the first birthday i can remember that i haven t had a party ira it was your aunt isabel gave you your parties madeline yes ira well you see now madeline stoutly oh well i don t need a party i m grown up now she reaches out for the old hungarian dish on the table holding it she looks to her father whose back is still turned her face tender she is about to speak when he speaks ira grown up now and going off and leaving me alone you too the last one and what for turning looking around the room as for those long gone there used to be so many in this house my grandmother she sat there pointing to the place near the open door fine days like this in that chair points to the rocker she d sit there tell me stories of the indians father it wasn t ever lonely where father was then madeline fejevary my madeline came to this house lived with me in this house then one day she walked out of this house through that door through the field out of this house bitter silence then fred out of this house now you with emil johnson insanely and almost with relief at leaving things more sane don t let him touch my corn if he touches one kernel of this corn with the suspicion of the tormented mind i wonder where he went how do i know he went where he said he was going getting up i dunno as that south bin s locked madeline oh father ira i ll find out how do i know what he s doing he goes out turning left madeline goes to the window and looks after him a moment later hearing someone at the door she turns and finds her aunt isabel who has appeared from right goes swiftly to her hands out madeline oh auntie i m glad you came it s my birthday and i m lonely aunt isabel you dear little girl again giving her a hug which madeline returns lovingly don t i know it s your birthday don t think that day will ever get by while your aunt isabel s around just see what s here for your birthday hands her the package she is carrying madeline with a gasp suspecting from its shape oh her face aglow why is it aunt isabel laughing affectionately foolish child open it and see madeline loosens the paper and pulls out a tennis racket madeline excited and moved oh aunt isabel that was dear of you i shouldn t have thought you d quite do that aunt isabel i couldn t imagine madeline without a racket gathering up the paper lightly reproachful but be a little careful of it madeline it s meant for tennis balls they laugh together madeline making a return with it it s a peach changing wonder where i ll play now aunt isabel why you ll play on the courts at morton college who has a better right madeline oh i don t know it s pretty much balled up isn t it aunt isabel yes we ll have to get it straightened out gently it was really dreadful of you madeline to rush out a second time it isn t as if they were people who were anything to you madeline but auntie they are something to me aunt isabel oh dear that s what horace said madeline what s what horace said aunt isabel that you must have a case on one of them madeline that s what horace would say that makes me sore aunt isabel i m sorry i spoke of it horace is absurd in some ways madeline he s a aunt isabel stopping it with her hand no he isn t he s a headstrong boy but a very loving one he s dear with me madeline madeline yes you are good to each other her eyes are drawn to the cell aunt isabel of course we are we d be a pretty poor sort if we weren t and these are days when we have to stand together all of us who are the same kind of people must stand together because the thing that makes us the same kind of people is threatened madeline don t you think we re rather threatening it ourselves auntie aunt isabel why no we re fighting for it madeline fighting for what aunt isabel for americanism for democracy madeline horace is fighting for it aunt isabel well horace does go at it as if it were a football game but his heart s in the right place madeline somehow i don t seem to see my heart in that place aunt isabel in what place madeline where horace s heart is aunt isabel it s too bad you and horace quarrel but you and i don t quarrel madeline madeline again drawn to the cell no you and i don t quarrel she is troubled aunt isabel funny child do you want us to madeline turns laughing a little takes the dish from the table holds it out to her aunt madeline have some fudge auntie aunt isabel taking the dish do you use them the old hungarian dishes laughingly i m not allowed to your uncle is so choice of the few pieces we have and here are you with fudge in one of them madeline i made the fudge because oh i don t know i had to do something to celebrate my birthday aunt isabel under her breath dearie madeline and then that didn t seem to make a birthday so i happened to see this way up on a top shelf and i remembered that it was my mother s it was nice to get it down and use it almost as if mother was giving me a birthday present aunt isabel and how she would love to give you a birthday present madeline it was her mother s i suppose and they brought it from hungary aunt isabel yes they brought only a very few things with them and left oh so many beautiful ones behind madeline quietly rather nice of them wasn t it her aunt waits inquiringly to leave their own beautiful things their own beautiful life behind simply because they believed life should be more beautiful for more people aunt isabel with constraint yes gayly turning it well now as to the birthday what do you suppose sarah is doing this instant putting red frosting on white frosting writing it with her finger madeline and what do you suppose horace is doing this a little reproachfully running around buying twenty one red candles twenty two one to grow on big birthday cake party to night madeline but auntie i don t see how i can be there aunt isabel listen dear now we ve got to use our wits and all pull together of course we d do anything in the world rather than see you left to outsiders i ve never seen your uncle as worried and truly madeline as sad oh my dear it s these human things that count what would life be without the love we have for each other madeline the love we have for each other aunt isabel why yes dearest don t turn away from me madeline don t don t be strange i wonder if you realize how your uncle has worked to have life a happy thing for all of us be a little generous to him he s had this great burden of bringing something from another day on into this day it is not as simple as it may seem he s done it as best he could it will hurt him as nothing has ever hurt him if you now undo that work of his life truly dear do you feel you know enough about it to do that another thing people are a little absurd out of their own places we need to be held in our relationships against our background or we are i don t know grotesque come now madeline where s your sense of humour isn t it a little absurd for you to leave home over india s form of government madeline it s not india it s america a sense of humour is nothing to hide behind aunt isabel with a laugh i knew i wouldn t be a success at world affairs better leave that to professor holden a quick keen look from madeline they ve driven on to the river they ll be back for me and then he wants to stop in for a visit with you while i take mrs holden for a further ride i m worried about her she doesn t gain strength at all since her operation i m going to try keeping her out in the air all i can madeline it s dreadful about families aunt isabel dreadful professor holden s devotion to his wife is one of the most beautiful things i ve ever seen madeline and is that all you see it in aunt isabel you mean the responsibility it brings oh well that s what life is doing for one another sacrificing for one another madeline i hope i never have a family aunt isabel well i hope you do you ll miss the best of life if you don t anyway you have a family where is your father madeline i don t know aunt isabel i d like to see him madeline there s no use seeing him today aunt isabel he s madeline strange shut in afraid something s going to be taken from him aunt isabel poor ira so much has been taken from him and now you don t hurt him again madeline he can t bear it you see what it does to him madeline he has the wrong idea about things aunt isabel the wrong idea oh my child that s awfully young and hard it s so much deeper than that life has made him into something something he can t escape madeline with what seems sullenness well i don t want to be made into that thing aunt isabel of course not but you want to help him don t you now dear about your birthday party madeline the united states commissioner is giving me my birthday party aunt isabel well he ll have to put his party off your uncle has been thinking it all out we re to go to his office and you ll have a talk with him and with judge watkins he s off the state supreme bench now practising again and as a favour to your uncle he will be your lawyer you don t know how relieved we are at this for judge watkins can do anything he wants to do practically then you and i will go on home and call up some of the crowd to come in and dance to night we have some beautiful new records there s a hungarian waltz madeline and what s the price of all this auntie aunt isabel the oh you mean why simply say you felt sorry for the hindu students because they seemed rather alone that you hadn t realized what they were hadn t thought out what you were saying madeline and that i m sorry and will never do it again aunt isabel i don t know that you need say that it would be gracious i think to indicate it madeline i m sorry you had the cake made i suppose you can eat it anyway i turning away can t eat it aunt isabel why madeline seeing how she has hurt her madeline goes out to her aunt madeline auntie dear i m sorry if i hurt your feelings aunt isabel quick to hold out a loving hand laughing a little they ve been good birthday cakes haven t they madeline madeline she now trying not to cry i don t know what i d have done without them don t know what i will do without them i don t see it aunt isabel don t try to please don t see it just let me go on helping you that s all i ask she draws madeline to her ah dearie i held you when you were a little baby without your mother all those years count for something madeline there s just nothing to life if years of love don t count for something listening i think i hear them and here are we weeping like two idiots madeline brushes away tears aunt isabel arranges her veil regaining her usual poise professor holden was hoping you d take a tramp with him wouldn t that do you good anyway a talk with him will be nice i know he admires you immensely and really perhaps i shouldn t let you know this sympathizes with your feeling so i think his maturer way of looking at things will show you just the adjustment you need to become a really big and useful person there s so much to be done in the world madeline of course we ought to make it a better world in a manner of agreement with madeline i feel very strongly about all that perhaps we can do some things together i d love that don t think i m hopeless way down deep we have the same feeling yes here s professor holden holden comes in he seems older holden and how are you madeline holding out his hand madeline i m all right holden many happy returns of the day embarrassed by her half laugh the birthday aunt isabel and did you have a nice look up the river holden i never saw this country as lovely as it is to day mary is just drinking it in aunt isabel you don t think the further ride will be too much holden oh no not in that car aunt isabel then we ll go on perhaps as far as laughing creek if you two decide on a tramp take that road and we ll pick you up smiling warmly she goes out holden how good she is madeline yes that s just the trouble holden with difficulty getting past this how about a little tramp there ll never be another such day madeline i used to tramp with fred jordan this is where he is now stepping inside the cell he doesn t even see out holden it s all wrong that he should be where he is but for you to stay indoors won t help him madeline madeline it won t help him but today i can t go out holden i m sorry my child when this sense of wrongs done first comes down upon one it does crush madeline and later you get used to it and don t care holden you care you try not to destroy yourself needlessly he turns from her look madeline play safe holden if it s playing safe it s that one you love more than yourself be safe it would be a luxury to destroy one s self madeline that sounds like uncle felix seeing she has hurt him she goes over and sits across from him at the table i m sorry i say the wrong things today holden i don t know that you do madeline but isn t uncle funny his left mind doesn t know what his right mind is doing he has to think of himself as a person of sentiment idealism and quite a job at times clever how he gets away with it the war must have been a godsend to people who were in danger of getting on to themselves but i should think you could fool all of yourself all the time holden you don t he is rubbing his hand on the table madeline grandfather morton made this table i suppose he and grandfather fejevary used to sit here and talk they were great old pals slowly holden turns and looks out at the hill yes how beautiful the hill must have been before there was a college there he looks away from the hill did you know grandfather morton holden yes i knew him speaking of it against his will i had a wonderful talk with him once about greece and the cornfields and life madeline i d like to have been a pioneer some ways they had it fierce but think of the fun they had a whole big land to open up a big new life to begin her hands closing in from wideness to a smaller thing why did so much get shut out just a little way back anything might have been what happened holden speaking with difficulty it got set too soon madeline all of her mind open trying to know and why did it prosperous i suppose that seems to set things set them in fear silas morton wasn t afraid of felix fejevary the hungarian revolutionist he laid this country at that refugee s feet that s what uncle felix says himself with the left half of his mind now the hindu revolutionists pause i took a walk late yesterday afternoon night came and for some reason i thought of how many nights have come nights the earth has known long before we knew the earth the moon came up and i thought of how moonlight made this country beautiful before any man knew that moonlight was beautiful it gave me a feeling of coming from something a long way back moving toward what will be here when i m not here moving we seem here now in america to have forgotten we re moving think it s just us just now of course that would make us afraid and ridiculous her father comes in ira your aunt isabel did she go away and leave you madeline she s coming back ira for you madeline she wants me to go with her this is professor holden father holden how do you do mr morton ira nods not noticing holden s offered hand how do when is she coming back madeline soon ira and then you re going with her madeline i don t know ira i say you go with her you want them all to come down on us to holden what are you here for madeline aunt isabel brought professor holden father ira oh then you you tell her what to do you make her do it he goes into the room at left madeline sadly after a silence father s like something touched by an early frost holden yes seeing his opening and forcing himself to take it but do you know madeline there are other ways of that happening touched by an early frost i ve seen it happen to people i know people of fine and daring mind they do a thing that puts them apart it may be the big brave thing but the apartness does something to them i ve seen it many times so many times so many times i fear for you you do this thing and you ll find yourself with people who in many ways you don t care for at all find yourself apart from people who in most ways are your own people you re many sided madeline moves her tennis racket i don t know about it s all going to one side i hate to see you so young close a door on so much life i m being just as honest with you as i know how i myself am making compromises to stay within i don t like it but there are reasons for doing it i can t see you leave that main body without telling you all it is you are leaving it s not a clean cut case the side of the world or the side of the angels i hate to see you lose the fullness of life madeline a slight start as she realizes the pause as one recalled from far i m sorry i was listening to what you were saying but all the time something else was happening grandfather morton big and oh terrible he was here and we went to that walled up hole in the ground rising and pointing down at the chalked cell where they keep fred jordan on bread and water because he couldn t be a part of nations of men killing each other and silas morton only he was all that is back of us tore open that cell it was his voice tore it open his voice as he cried god damn you this is america sitting down as if rallying from a tremendous experience i m sorry it should have happened while you were speaking won t you go on holden that s a pretty hard thing to go on against after a moment i can t go on madeline you were thinking of leaving the college and then decided to stay he nods and you feel there s more fullness of life for you inside the college than outside holden no not exactly again a pause it s very hard for me to talk to you madeline gently perhaps we needn t do it holden something in him forcing him to say it i m staying for financial reasons madeline kind but not going to let the truth get away you don t think that having to stay within or deciding to rather makes you think these things of the blight of being without holden i think there is danger to you in so young becoming alien to society madeline as great as the danger of staying within and becoming like the thing i m within holden you wouldn t become like it madeline why wouldn t i that s what it does to the rest of you i don t see it this fullness of life business i don t see that uncle felix has got it or even aunt isabel and you i think that in buying it you re losing it holden i don t think you know what a cruel thing you are saying madeline there must be something pretty rotten about morton college if you have to sell your soul to stay in it holden you don t sell your soul you persuade yourself to wait madeline unable to look at him as if feeling shame you have had a talk with uncle felix since that day in the library you stepped aside for me to pass holden yes and with my wife s physician if you sell your soul it s to love you sell it madeline low that s strange it s love that brings life along and then it s love holds life back holden and all the time with this effort against hopelessness leaving me out of it i d like to see you give yourself a little more chance for detachment you need a better intellectual equipment if you re going to fight the world you find yourself in i think you will count for more if you wait and when you strike strike more maturely madeline detachment pause this is one thing they do at this place she moves to the open door chain them up to the bars just like this in the doorway where her two grandfathers once pledged faith with the dreams of a million years she raises clasped hands as high as
