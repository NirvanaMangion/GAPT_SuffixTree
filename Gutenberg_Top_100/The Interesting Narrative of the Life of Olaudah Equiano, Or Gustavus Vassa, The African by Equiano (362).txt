permit me  with the greatest deference and respect  to lay at your
feet the following genuine narrative  the chief design of which is to
excite in your august assemblies a sense of compassion for the
miseries which the slave trade has entailed on my unfortunate
countrymen  by the horrors of that trade was i first torn away from
all the tender connexions that were naturally dear to my heart  but
these  through the mysterious ways of providence  i ought to regard as
infinitely more than compensated by the introduction i have thence
obtained to the knowledge of the christian religion  and of a nation
which  by its liberal sentiments  its humanity  the glorious freedom
of its government  and its proficiency in arts and sciences  has
exalted the dignity of human nature 

i am sensible i ought to entreat your pardon for addressing to you a
work so wholly devoid of literary merit  but  as the production of an
unlettered african  who is actuated by the hope of becoming an
instrument towards the relief of his suffering countrymen  i trust
that  such a man   pleading in  such a cause   will be acquitted of
boldness and presumption 

may the god of heaven inspire your hearts with peculiar benevolence on
that important day when the question of abolition is to be discussed 
when thousands  in consequence of your determination  are to look for
happiness or misery

i believe it is difficult for those who publish their own memoirs to
escape the imputation of vanity  nor is this the only disadvantage
under which they labour  it is also their misfortune  that what is
uncommon is rarely  if ever  believed  and what is obvious we are apt
to turn from with disgust  and to charge the writer with impertinence 
people generally think those memoirs only worthy to be read or
remembered which abound in great or striking events  those  in short 
which in a high degree excite either admiration or pity  all others
they consign to contempt and oblivion  it is therefore  i confess  not
a little hazardous in a private and obscure individual  and a stranger
too  thus to solicit the indulgent attention of the public  especially
when i own i offer here the history of neither a saint  a hero  nor a
tyrant  i believe there are few events in my life  which have not
happened to many  it is true the incidents of it are numerous  and 
did i consider myself an european  i might say my sufferings were
great  but when i compare my lot with that of most of my countrymen  i
regard myself as a  particular favourite of heaven   and acknowledge
the mercies of providence in every occurrence of my life  if then the
following narrative does not appear sufficiently interesting to engage
general attention  let my motive be some excuse for its publication  i
am not so foolishly vain as to expect from it either immortality or
literary reputation  if it affords any satisfaction to my numerous
friends  at whose request it has been written  or in the smallest
degree promotes the interests of humanity  the ends for which it was
undertaken will be fully attained  and every wish of my heart
gratified  let it therefore be remembered  that  in wishing to avoid
censure  i do not aspire to praise 

that part of africa  known by the name of guinea  to which the trade
for slaves is carried on  extends along the coast above      miles 
from the senegal to angola  and includes a variety of kingdoms  of
these the most considerable is the kingdom of benen  both as to extent
and wealth  the richness and cultivation of the soil  the power of its
king  and the number and warlike disposition of the inhabitants  it is
situated nearly under the line  and extends along the coast about    
miles  but runs back into the interior part of africa to a distance
hitherto i believe unexplored by any traveller  and seems only
terminated at length by the empire of abyssinia  near      miles from
its beginning  this kingdom is divided into many provinces or
districts  in one of the most remote and fertile of which  called
eboe  i was born  in the year       in a charming fruitful vale  named
essaka  the distance of this province from the capital of benin and
the sea coast must be very considerable  for i had never heard of
white men or europeans  nor of the sea  and our subjection to the king
of benin was little more than nominal  for every transaction of the
government  as far as my slender observation extended  was conducted
by the chiefs or elders of the place  the manners and government of a
people who have little commerce with other countries are generally
very simple  and the history of what passes in one family or village
may serve as a specimen of a nation  my father was one of those elders
or chiefs i have spoken of  and was styled embrenche  a term  as i
remember  importing the highest distinction  and signifying in our
language a  mark  of grandeur  this mark is conferred on the person
entitled to it  by cutting the skin across at the top of the forehead 
and drawing it down to the eye brows  and while it is in this
situation applying a warm hand  and rubbing it until it shrinks up
into a thick  weal  across the lower part of the forehead  most of the
judges and senators were thus marked  my father had long born it  i
had seen it conferred on one of my brothers  and i was also
 destined  to receive it by my parents  those embrence  or chief men 
decided disputes and punished crimes  for which purpose they always
assembled together  the proceedings were generally short  and in most
cases the law of retaliation prevailed  i remember a man was brought
before my father  and the other judges  for kidnapping a boy  and 
although he was the son of a chief or senator  he was condemned to
make recompense by a man or woman slave  adultery  however  was
sometimes punished with slavery or death  a punishment which i believe
is inflicted on it throughout most of the nations of africa a   so
sacred among them is the honour of the marriage bed  and so jealous
are they of the fidelity of their wives  of this i recollect an
instance   a woman was convicted before the judges of adultery  and
delivered over  as the custom was  to her husband to be punished 
accordingly he determined to put her to death  but it being found 
just before her execution  that she had an infant at her breast  and
no woman being prevailed on to perform the part of a nurse  she was
spared on account of the child  the men  however  do not preserve the
same constancy to their wives  which they expect from them  for they
indulge in a plurality  though seldom in more than two  their mode of
marriage is thus   both parties are usually betrothed when young by
their parents   though i have known the males to betroth themselves  
on this occasion a feast is prepared  and the bride and bridegroom
stand up in the midst of all their friends  who are assembled for the
purpose  while he declares she is thenceforth to be looked upon as his
wife  and that no other person is to pay any addresses to her  this is
also immediately proclaimed in the vicinity  on which the bride
retires from the assembly  some time after she is brought home to her
husband  and then another feast is made  to which the relations of
both parties are invited  her parents then deliver her to the
bridegroom  accompanied with a number of blessings  and at the same
time they tie round her waist a cotton string of the thickness of a
goose quill  which none but married women are permitted to wear  she
is now considered as completely his wife  and at this time the dowry
is given to the new married pair  which generally consists of portions
of land  slaves  and cattle  household goods  and implements of
husbandry  these are offered by the friends of both parties  besides
which the parents of the bridegroom present gifts to those of the
bride  whose property she is looked upon before marriage  but after it
she is esteemed the sole property of her husband  the ceremony being
now ended the festival begins  which is celebrated with bonefires  and
loud acclamations of joy  accompanied with music and dancing 

we are almost a nation of dancers  musicians  and poets  thus every
great event  such as a triumphant return from battle  or other cause
of public rejoicing is celebrated in public dances  which are
accompanied with songs and music suited to the occasion  the assembly
is separated into four divisions  which dance either apart or in
succession  and each with a character peculiar to itself  the first
division contains the married men  who in their dances frequently
exhibit feats of arms  and the representation of a battle  to these
succeed the married women  who dance in the second division  the young
men occupy the third  and the maidens the fourth  each represents some
interesting scene of real life  such as a great achievement  domestic
employment  a pathetic story  or some rural sport  and as the subject
is generally founded on some recent event  it is therefore ever new 
this gives our dances a spirit and variety which i have scarcely seen
elsewhere b   we have many musical instruments  particularly drums of
different kinds  a piece of music which resembles a guitar  and
another much like a stickado  these last are chiefly used by betrothed
virgins  who play on them on all grand festivals 

as our manners are simple  our luxuries are few  the dress of both
sexes is nearly the same  it generally consists of a long piece of
callico  or muslin  wrapped loosely round the body  somewhat in the
form of a highland plaid  this is usually dyed blue  which is our
favourite colour  it is extracted from a berry  and is brighter and
richer than any i have seen in europe  besides this  our women of
distinction wear golden ornaments  which they dispose with some
profusion on their arms and legs  when our women are not employed with
the men in tillage  their usual occupation is spinning and weaving
cotton  which they afterwards dye  and make it into garments  they
also manufacture earthen vessels  of which we have many kinds  among
the rest tobacco pipes  made after the same fashion  and used in the
same manner  as those in turkey c  

our manner of living is entirely plain  for as yet the natives are
unacquainted with those refinements in cookery which debauch the
taste  bullocks  goats  and poultry  supply the greatest part of their
food  these constitute likewise the principal wealth of the country 
and the chief articles of its commerce  the flesh is usually stewed in
a pan  to make it savoury we sometimes use also pepper  and other
spices  and we have salt made of wood ashes  our vegetables are mostly
plantains  eadas  yams  beans  and indian corn  the head of the family
usually eats alone  his wives and slaves have also their separate
tables  before we taste food we always wash our hands  indeed our
cleanliness on all occasions is extreme  but on this it is an
indispensable ceremony  after washing  libation is made  by pouring
out a small portion of the food  in a certain place  for the spirits
of departed relations  which the natives suppose to preside over their
conduct  and guard them from evil  they are totally unacquainted with
strong or spirituous liquours  and their principal beverage is palm
wine  this is gotten from a tree of that name by tapping it at the
top  and fastening a large gourd to it  and sometimes one tree will
yield three or four gallons in a night  when just drawn it is of a
most delicious sweetness  but in a few days it acquires a tartish and
more spirituous flavour  though i never saw any one intoxicated by it 
the same tree also produces nuts and oil  our principal luxury is in
perfumes  one sort of these is an odoriferous wood of delicious
fragrance  the other a kind of earth  a small portion of which thrown
into the fire diffuses a most powerful odour d   we beat this wood
into powder  and mix it with palm oil  with which both men and women
perfume themselves 

in our buildings we study convenience rather than ornament  each
master of a family has a large square piece of ground  surrounded with
a moat or fence  or enclosed with a wall made of red earth tempered 
which  when dry  is as hard as brick  within this are his houses to
accommodate his family and slaves  which  if numerous  frequently
present the appearance of a village  in the middle stands the
principal building  appropriated to the sole use of the master  and
consisting of two apartments  in one of which he sits in the day with
his family  the other is left apart for the reception of his friends 
he has besides these a distinct apartment in which he sleeps  together
with his male children  on each side are the apartments of his wives 
who have also their separate day and night houses  the habitations of
the slaves and their families are distributed throughout the rest of
the enclosure  these houses never exceed one story in height  they are
always built of wood  or stakes driven into the ground  crossed with
wattles  and neatly plastered within  and without  the roof is
thatched with reeds  our day houses are left open at the sides  but
those in which we sleep are always covered  and plastered in the
inside  with a composition mixed with cow dung  to keep off the
different insects  which annoy us during the night  the walls and
floors also of these are generally covered with mats  our beds consist
of a platform  raised three or four feet from the ground  on which are
laid skins  and different parts of a spungy tree called plaintain  our
covering is calico or muslin  the same as our dress  the usual seats
are a few logs of wood  but we have benches  which are generally
perfumed  to accommodate strangers  these compose the greater part of
our household furniture  houses so constructed and furnished require
but little skill to erect them  every man is a sufficient architect
for the purpose  the whole neighbourhood afford their unanimous
assistance in building them and in return receive  and expect no other
recompense than a feast 

as we live in a country where nature is prodigal of her favours  our
wants are few and easily supplied  of course we have few manufactures 
they consist for the most part of calicoes  earthern ware  ornaments 
and instruments of war and husbandry  but these make no part of our
commerce  the principal articles of which  as i have observed  are
provisions  in such a state money is of little use  however we have
some small pieces of coin  if i may call them such  they are made
something like an anchor  but i do not remember either their value or
denomination  we have also markets  at which i have been frequently
with my mother  these are sometimes visited by stout mahogany coloured
men from the south west of us  we call them oye eboe  which term
signifies red men living at a distance  they generally bring us
fire arms  gunpowder  hats  beads  and dried fish  the last we
esteemed a great rarity  as our waters were only brooks and springs 
these articles they barter with us for odoriferous woods and earth 
and our salt of wood ashes  they always carry slaves through our land 
but the strictest account is exacted of their manner of procuring them
before they are suffered to pass  sometimes indeed we sold slaves to
them  but they were only prisoners of war  or such among us as had
been convicted of kidnapping  or adultery  and some other crimes 
which we esteemed heinous  this practice of kidnapping induces me to
think  that  notwithstanding all our strictness  their principal
business among us was to trepan our people  i remember too they
carried great sacks along with them  which not long after i had an
opportunity of fatally seeing applied to that infamous purpose 

our land is uncommonly rich and fruitful  and produces all kinds of
vegetables in great abundance  we have plenty of indian corn  and vast
quantities of cotton and tobacco  our pine apples grow without
culture  they are about the size of the largest sugar loaf  and finely
flavoured  we have also spices of different kinds  particularly
pepper  and a variety of delicious fruits which i have never seen in
europe  together with gums of various kinds  and honey in abundance 
all our industry is exerted to improve those blessings of nature 
agriculture is our chief employment  and every one  even the children
and women  are engaged in it  thus we are all habituated to labour
from our earliest years  every one contributes something to the common
stock  and as we are unacquainted with idleness  we have no beggars 
the benefits of such a mode of living are obvious  the west india
planters prefer the slaves of benin or eboe to those of any other part
of guinea  for their hardiness  intelligence  integrity  and zeal 
those benefits are felt by us in the general healthiness of the
people  and in their vigour and activity  i might have added too in
their comeliness  deformity is indeed unknown amongst us  i mean that
of shape  numbers of the natives of eboe now in london might be
brought in support of this assertion  for  in regard to complexion 
ideas of beauty are wholly relative  i remember while in africa to
have seen three negro children  who were tawny  and another quite
white  who were universally regarded by myself  and the natives in
general  as far as related to their complexions  as deformed  our
women too were in my eyes at least uncommonly graceful  alert  and
modest to a degree of bashfulness  nor do i remember to have ever
heard of an instance of incontinence amongst them before marriage 
they are also remarkably cheerful  indeed cheerfulness and affability
are two of the leading characteristics of our nation 

our tillage is exercised in a large plain or common  some hours walk
from our dwellings  and all the neighbours resort thither in a body 
they use no beasts of husbandry  and their only instruments are hoes 
axes  shovels  and beaks  or pointed iron to dig with  sometimes we
are visited by locusts  which come in large clouds  so as to darken
the air  and destroy our harvest  this however happens rarely  but
when it does  a famine is produced by it  i remember an instance or
two wherein this happened  this common is often the theatre of war 
and therefore when our people go out to till their land  they not only
go in a body  but generally take their arms with them for fear of a
surprise  and when they apprehend an invasion they guard the avenues
to their dwellings  by driving sticks into the ground  which are so
sharp at one end as to pierce the foot  and are generally dipt in
poison  from what i can recollect of these battles  they appear to
have been irruptions of one little state or district on the other  to
obtain prisoners or booty  perhaps they were incited to this by those
traders who brought the european goods i mentioned amongst us  such a
mode of obtaining slaves in africa is common  and i believe more are
procured this way  and by kidnapping  than any other e   when a trader
wants slaves  he applies to a chief for them  and tempts him with his
wares  it is not extraordinary  if on this occasion he yields to the
temptation with as little firmness  and accepts the price of his
fellow creatures liberty with as little reluctance as the enlightened
merchant  accordingly he falls on his neighbours  and a desperate
battle ensues  if he prevails and takes prisoners  he gratifies his
avarice by selling them  but  if his party be vanquished  and he falls
into the hands of the enemy  he is put to death  for  as he has been
known to foment their quarrels  it is thought dangerous to let him
survive  and no ransom can save him  though all other prisoners may be
redeemed  we have fire arms  bows and arrows  broad two edged swords
and javelins  we have shields also which cover a man from head to
foot  all are taught the use of these weapons  even our women are
warriors  and march boldly out to fight along with the men  our whole
district is a kind of militia  on a certain signal given  such as the
firing of a gun at night  they all rise in arms and rush upon their
enemy  it is perhaps something remarkable  that when our people march
to the field a red flag or banner is borne before them  i was once a
witness to a battle in our common  we had been all at work in it one
day as usual  when our people were suddenly attacked  i climbed a tree
at some distance  from which i beheld the fight  there were many women
as well as men on both sides  among others my mother was there  and
armed with a broad sword  after fighting for a considerable time with
great fury  and after many had been killed our people obtained the
victory  and took their enemy s chief prisoner  he was carried off in
great triumph  and  though he offered a large ransom for his life  he
was put to death  a virgin of note among our enemies had been slain in
the battle  and her arm was exposed in our market place  where our
trophies were always exhibited  the spoils were divided according to
the merit of the warriors  those prisoners which were not sold or
redeemed we kept as slaves  but how different was their condition from
that of the slaves in the west indies  with us they do no more work
than other members of the community  even their masters  their food 
clothing and lodging were nearly the same as theirs   except that they
were not permitted to eat with those who were free born   and there
was scarce any other difference between them  than a superior degree
of importance which the head of a family possesses in our state  and
that authority which  as such  he exercises over every part of his
household  some of these slaves have even slaves under them as their
own property  and for their own use 

as to religion  the natives believe that there is one creator of all
things  and that he lives in the sun  and is girted round with a belt
that he may never eat or drink  but  according to some  he smokes a
pipe  which is our own favourite luxury  they believe he governs
events  especially our deaths or captivity  but  as for the doctrine
of eternity  i do not remember to have ever heard of it  some however
believe in the transmigration of souls in a certain degree  those
spirits  which are not transmigrated  such as our dear friends or
relations  they believe always attend them  and guard them from the
bad spirits or their foes  for this reason they always before eating 
as i have observed  put some small portion of the meat  and pour some
of their drink  on the ground for them  and they often make oblations
of the blood of beasts or fowls at their graves  i was very fond of my
mother  and almost constantly with her  when she went to make these
oblations at her mother s tomb  which was a kind of small solitary
thatched house  i sometimes attended her  there she made her
libations  and spent most of the night in cries and lamentations  i
have been often extremely terrified on these occasions  the loneliness
of the place  the darkness of the night  and the ceremony of libation 
naturally awful and gloomy  were heightened by my mother s
lamentations  and these  concuring with the cries of doleful birds  by
which these places were frequented  gave an inexpressible terror to
the scene 

we compute the year from the day on which the sun crosses the line 
and on its setting that evening there is a general shout throughout
the land  at least i can speak from my own knowledge throughout our
vicinity  the people at the same time make a great noise with rattles 
not unlike the basket rattles used by children here  though much
larger  and hold up their hands to heaven for a blessing  it is then
the greatest offerings are made  and those children whom our wise men
foretel will be fortunate are then presented to different people  i
remember many used to come to see me  and i was carried about to
others for that purpose  they have many offerings  particularly at
full moons  generally two at harvest before the fruits are taken out
of the ground  and when any young animals are killed  sometimes they
offer up part of them as a sacrifice  these offerings  when made by
one of the heads of a family  serve for the whole  i remember we often
had them at my father s and my uncle s  and their families have been
present  some of our offerings are eaten with bitter herbs  we had a
saying among us to any one of a cross temper   that if they were to be
eaten  they should be eaten with bitter herbs  

we practised circumcision like the jews  and made offerings and feasts
on that occasion in the same manner as they did  like them also  our
children were named from some event  some circumstance  or fancied
foreboding at the time of their birth  i was named  olaudah   which 
in our language  signifies vicissitude or fortune also  one favoured 
and having a loud voice and well spoken  i remember we never polluted
the name of the object of our adoration  on the contrary  it was
always mentioned with the greatest reverence  and we were totally
unacquainted with swearing  and all those terms of abuse and reproach
which find their way so readily and copiously into the languages of
more civilized people  the only expressions of that kind i remember
were  may you rot  or may you swell  or may a beast take you  

i have before remarked that the natives of this part of africa are
extremely cleanly  this necessary habit of decency was with us a part
of religion  and therefore we had many purifications and washings 
indeed almost as many  and used on the same occasions  if my
recollection does not fail me  as the jews  those that touched the
dead at any time were obliged to wash and purify themselves before
they could enter a dwelling house  every woman too  at certain times 
was forbidden to come into a dwelling house  or touch any person  or
any thing we ate  i was so fond of my mother i could not keep from
her  or avoid touching her at some of those periods  in consequence of
which i was obliged to be kept out with her  in a little house made
for that purpose  till offering was made  and then we were purified 

though we had no places of public worship  we had priests and
magicians  or wise men  i do not remember whether they had different
offices  or whether they were united in the same persons  but they
were held in great reverence by the people  they calculated our time 
and foretold events  as their name imported  for we called them
ah affoe way cah  which signifies calculators or yearly men  our year
being called ah affoe  they wore their beards  and when they died they
were succeeded by their sons  most of their implements and things of
value were interred along with them  pipes and tobacco were also put
into the grave with the corpse  which was always perfumed and
ornamented  and animals were offered in sacrifice to them  none
accompanied their funerals but those of the same profession or tribe 
these buried them after sunset  and always returned from the grave by
a different way from that which they went 

these magicians were also our doctors or physicians  they practised
bleeding by cupping  and were very successful in healing wounds and
expelling poisons  they had likewise some extraordinary method of
discovering jealousy  theft  and poisoning  the success of which no
doubt they derived from their unbounded influence over the credulity
and superstition of the people  i do not remember what those methods
were  except that as to poisoning  i recollect an instance or two 
which i hope it will not be deemed impertinent here to insert  as it
may serve as a kind of specimen of the rest  and is still used by the
negroes in the west indies  a virgin had been poisoned  but it was not
known by whom  the doctors ordered the corpse to be taken up by some
persons  and carried to the grave  as soon as the bearers had raised
it on their shoulders  they seemed seized with some f  sudden
impulse  and ran to and fro unable to stop themselves  at last  after
having passed through a number of thorns and prickly bushes unhurt 
the corpse fell from them close to a house  and defaced it in the
fall  and  the owner being taken up  he immediately confessed the
poisoning g  

the natives are extremely cautious about poison  when they buy any
eatable the seller kisses it all round before the buyer  to shew him
it is not poisoned  and the same is done when any meat or drink is
presented  particularly to a stranger  we have serpents of different
kinds  some of which are esteemed ominous when they appear in our
houses  and these we never molest  i remember two of those ominous
snakes  each of which was as thick as the calf of a man s leg  and in
colour resembling a dolphin in the water  crept at different times
into my mother s night house  where i always lay with her  and coiled
themselves into folds  and each time they crowed like a cock  i was
desired by some of our wise men to touch these  that i might be
interested in the good omens  which i did  for they were quite
harmless  and would tamely suffer themselves to be handled  and then
they were put into a large open earthen pan  and set on one side of
the highway  some of our snakes  however  were poisonous  one of them
crossed the road one day when i was standing on it  and passed between
my feet without offering to touch me  to the great surprise of many
who saw it  and these incidents were accounted by the wise men  and
therefore by my mother and the rest of the people  as remarkable omens
in my favour 

such is the imperfect sketch my memory has furnished me with of the
manners and customs of a people among whom i first drew my breath  and
here i cannot forbear suggesting what has long struck me very
forcibly  namely  the strong analogy which even by this sketch 
imperfect as it is  appears to prevail in the manners and customs of
my countrymen and those of the jews  before they reached the land of
promise  and particularly the patriarchs while they were yet in that
pastoral state which is described in genesis  an analogy  which alone
would induce me to think that the one people had sprung from the
other  indeed this is the opinion of dr  gill  who  in his commentary
on genesis  very ably deduces the pedigree of the africans from afer
and afra  the descendants of abraham by keturah his wife and concubine
 for both these titles are applied to her   it is also conformable to
the sentiments of dr  john clarke  formerly dean of sarum  in his
truth of the christian religion  both these authors concur in
ascribing to us this original  the reasonings of these gentlemen are
still further confirmed by the scripture chronology  and if any
further corroboration were required  this resemblance in so many
respects is a strong evidence in support of the opinion  like the
israelites in their primitive state  our government was conducted by
our chiefs or judges  our wise men and elders  and the head of a
family with us enjoyed a similar authority over his household with
that which is ascribed to abraham and the other patriarchs  the law of
retaliation obtained almost universally with us as with them  and even
their religion appeared to have shed upon us a ray of its glory 
though broken and spent in its passage  or eclipsed by the cloud with
which time  tradition  and ignorance might have enveloped it  for we
had our circumcision  a rule i believe peculiar to that people   we
had also our sacrifices and burnt offerings  our washings and
purifications  on the same occasions as they had 

as to the difference of colour between the eboan africans and the
modern jews  i shall not presume to account for it  it is a subject
which has engaged the pens of men of both genius and learning  and is
far above my strength  the most able and reverend mr  t  clarkson 
however  in his much admired essay on the slavery and commerce of the
human species  has ascertained the cause  in a manner that at once
solves every objection on that account  and  on my mind at least  has
produced the fullest conviction  i shall therefore refer to that
performance for the theory h   contenting myself with extracting a
fact as related by dr  mitchel i    the spaniards  who have inhabited
america  under the torrid zone  for any time  are become as dark
coloured as our native indians of virginia  of which  i myself have
been a witness    there is also another instance j  of a portuguese
settlement at mitomba  a river in sierra leona  where the inhabitants
are bred from a mixture of the first portuguese discoverers with the
natives  and are now become in their complexion  and in the woolly
quality of their hair   perfect negroes   retaining however a
smattering of the portuguese language 

these instances  and a great many more which might be adduced  while
they shew how the complexions of the same persons vary in different
climates  it is hoped may tend also to remove the prejudice that some
conceive against the natives of africa on account of their colour 
surely the minds of the spaniards did not change with their
complexions  are there not causes enough to which the apparent
inferiority of an african may be ascribed  without limiting the
goodness of god  and supposing he forbore to stamp understanding on
certainly his own image  because  carved in ebony   might it not
naturally be ascribed to their situation  when they come among
europeans  they are ignorant of their language  religion  manners  and
customs  are any pains taken to teach them these  are they treated as
men  does not slavery itself depress the mind  and extinguish all its
fire and every noble sentiment  but  above all  what advantages do not
a refined people possess over those who are rude and uncultivated  let
the polished and haughty european recollect that his ancestors were
once  like the africans  uncivilized  and even barbarous  did nature
make  them  inferior to their sons  and should  they too  have been
made slaves  every rational mind answers  no  let such reflections as
these melt the pride of their superiority into sympathy for the wants
and miseries of their sable brethren  and compel them to acknowledge 
that understanding is not confined to feature or colour  if  when they
look round the world  they feel exultation  let it be tempered with
benevolence to others  and gratitude to god   who hath made of one
blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth k  
and whose wisdom is not our wisdom  neither are our ways his ways

i hope the reader will not think i have trespassed on his
patience in introducing myself to him with some account of the manners
and customs of my country  they had been implanted in me with great
care  and made an impression on my mind  which time could not erase 
and which all the adversity and variety of fortune i have since
experienced served only to rivet and record  for  whether the love of
one s country be real or imaginary  or a lesson of reason  or an
instinct of nature  i still look back with pleasure on the first
scenes of my life  though that pleasure has been for the most part
mingled with sorrow 

i have already acquainted the reader with the time and place of my
birth  my father  besides many slaves  had a numerous family  of which
seven lived to grow up  including myself and a sister  who was the
only daughter  as i was the youngest of the sons  i became  of course 
the greatest favourite with my mother  and was always with her  and
she used to take particular pains to form my mind  i was trained up
from my earliest years in the art of war  my daily exercise was
shooting and throwing javelins  and my mother adorned me with emblems 
after the manner of our greatest warriors  in this way i grew up till
i was turned the age of eleven  when an end was put to my happiness in
the following manner   generally when the grown people in the
neighbourhood were gone far in the fields to labour  the children
assembled together in some of the neighbours  premises to play  and
commonly some of us used to get up a tree to look out for any
assailant  or kidnapper  that might come upon us  for they sometimes
took those opportunities of our parents  absence to attack and carry
off as many as they could seize  one day  as i was watching at the top
of a tree in our yard  i saw one of those people come into the yard of
our next neighbour but one  to kidnap  there being many stout young
people in it  immediately on this i gave the alarm of the rogue  and
he was surrounded by the stoutest of them  who entangled him with
cords  so that he could not escape till some of the grown people came
and secured him  but alas  ere long it was my fate to be thus
attacked  and to be carried off  when none of the grown people were
nigh  one day  when all our people were gone out to their works as
usual  and only i and my dear sister were left to mind the house  two
men and a woman got over our walls  and in a moment seized us both 
and  without giving us time to cry out  or make resistance  they
stopped our mouths  and ran off with us into the nearest wood  here
they tied our hands  and continued to carry us as far as they could 
till night came on  when we reached a small house  where the robbers
halted for refreshment  and spent the night  we were then unbound  but
were unable to take any food  and  being quite overpowered by fatigue
and grief  our only relief was some sleep  which allayed our
misfortune for a short time  the next morning we left the house  and
continued travelling all the day  for a long time we had kept the
woods  but at last we came into a road which i believed i knew  i had
now some hopes of being delivered  for we had advanced but a little
way before i discovered some people at a distance  on which i began to
cry out for their assistance  but my cries had no other effect than to
make them tie me faster and stop my mouth  and then they put me into a
large sack  they also stopped my sister s mouth  and tied her hands 
and in this manner we proceeded till we were out of the sight of these
people  when we went to rest the following night they offered us some
victuals  but we refused it  and the only comfort we had was in being
in one another s arms all that night  and bathing each other with our
tears  but alas  we were soon deprived of even the small comfort of
weeping together  the next day proved a day of greater sorrow than i
had yet experienced  for my sister and i were then separated  while we
lay clasped in each other s arms  it was in vain that we besought them
not to part us  she was torn from me  and immediately carried away 
while i was left in a state of distraction not to be described  i
cried and grieved continually  and for several days i did not eat any
thing but what they forced into my mouth  at length  after many days
travelling  during which i had often changed masters  i got into the
hands of a chieftain  in a very pleasant country  this man had two
wives and some children  and they all used me extremely well  and did
all they could to comfort me  particularly the first wife  who was
something like my mother  although i was a great many days journey
from my father s house  yet these people spoke exactly the same
language with us  this first master of mine  as i may call him  was a
smith  and my principal employment was working his bellows  which were
the same kind as i had seen in my vicinity  they were in some respects
not unlike the stoves here in gentlemen s kitchens  and were covered
over with leather  and in the middle of that leather a stick was
fixed  and a person stood up  and worked it  in the same manner as is
done to pump water out of a cask with a hand pump  i believe it was
gold he worked  for it was of a lovely bright yellow colour  and was
worn by the women on their wrists and ancles  i was there i suppose
about a month  and they at last used to trust me some little distance
from the house  this liberty i used in embracing every opportunity to
inquire the way to my own home  and i also sometimes  for the same
purpose  went with the maidens  in the cool of the evenings  to bring
pitchers of water from the springs for the use of the house  i had
also remarked where the sun rose in the morning  and set in the
evening  as i had travelled along  and i had observed that my father s
house was towards the rising of the sun  i therefore determined to
seize the first opportunity of making my escape  and to shape my
course for that quarter  for i was quite oppressed and weighed down by
grief after my mother and friends  and my love of liberty  ever great 
was strengthened by the mortifying circumstance of not daring to eat
with the free born children  although i was mostly their companion 
while i was projecting my escape  one day an unlucky event happened 
which quite disconcerted my plan  and put an end to my hopes  i used
to be sometimes employed in assisting an elderly woman slave to cook
and take care of the poultry  and one morning  while i was feeding
some chickens  i happened to toss a small pebble at one of them 
which hit it on the middle and directly killed it  the old slave 
having soon after missed the chicken  inquired after it  and on my
relating the accident  for i told her the truth  because my mother
would never suffer me to tell a lie  she flew into a violent passion 
threatened that i should suffer for it  and  my master being out  she
immediately went and told her mistress what i had done  this alarmed
me very much  and i expected an instant flogging  which to me was
uncommonly dreadful  for i had seldom been beaten at home  i therefore
resolved to fly  and accordingly i ran into a thicket that was hard
by  and hid myself in the bushes  soon afterwards my mistress and the
slave returned  and  not seeing me  they searched all the house  but
not finding me  and i not making answer when they called to me  they
thought i had run away  and the whole neighbourhood was raised in the
pursuit of me  in that part of the country  as in ours  the houses and
villages were skirted with woods  or shrubberies  and the bushes were
so thick that a man could readily conceal himself in them  so as to
elude the strictest search  the neighbours continued the whole day
looking for me  and several times many of them came within a few yards
of the place where i lay hid  i then gave myself up for lost entirely 
and expected every moment  when i heard a rustling among the trees  to
be found out  and punished by my master  but they never discovered me 
though they were often so near that i even heard their conjectures as
they were looking about for me  and i now learned from them  that any
attempt to return home would be hopeless  most of them supposed i had
fled towards home  but the distance was so great  and the way so
intricate  that they thought i could never reach it  and that i should
be lost in the woods  when i heard this i was seized with a violent
panic  and abandoned myself to despair  night too began to approach 
and aggravated all my fears  i had before entertained hopes of getting
home  and i had determined when it should be dark to make the attempt 
but i was now convinced it was fruitless  and i began to consider
that  if possibly i could escape all other animals  i could not those
of the human kind  and that  not knowing the way  i must perish in the
woods  thus was i like the hunted deer 

       ev ry leaf and ev ry whisp ring breath
    convey d a foe  and ev ry foe a death  

i heard frequent rustlings among the leaves  and being pretty sure
they were snakes i expected every instant to be stung by them  this
increased my anguish  and the horror of my situation became now quite
insupportable  i at length quitted the thicket  very faint and hungry 
for i had not eaten or drank any thing all the day  and crept to my
master s kitchen  from whence i set out at first  and which was an
open shed  and laid myself down in the ashes with an anxious wish for
death to relieve me from all my pains  i was scarcely awake in the
morning when the old woman slave  who was the first up  came to light
the fire  and saw me in the fire place  she was very much surprised to
see me  and could scarcely believe her own eyes  she now promised to
intercede for me  and went for her master  who soon after came  and 
having slightly reprimanded me  ordered me to be taken care of  and
not to be ill treated 

soon after this my master s only daughter  and child by his first
wife  sickened and died  which affected him so much that for some time
he was almost frantic  and really would have killed himself  had he
not been watched and prevented  however  in a small time afterwards he
recovered  and i was again sold  i was now carried to the left of the
sun s rising  through many different countries  and a number of large
woods  the people i was sold to used to carry me very often  when i
was tired  either on their shoulders or on their backs  i saw many
convenient well built sheds along the roads  at proper distances  to
accommodate the merchants and travellers  who lay in those buildings
along with their wives  who often accompany them  and they always go
well armed 

from the time i left my own nation i always found somebody that
understood me till i came to the sea coast  the languages of different
nations did not totally differ  nor were they so copious as those of
the europeans  particularly the english  they were therefore easily
learned  and  while i was journeying thus through africa  i acquired
two or three different tongues  in this manner i had been travelling
for a considerable time  when one evening  to my great surprise  whom
should i see brought to the house where i was but my dear sister  as
soon as she saw me she gave a loud shriek  and ran into my arms  i was
quite overpowered  neither of us could speak  but  for a considerable
time  clung to each other in mutual embraces  unable to do any thing
but weep  our meeting affected all who saw us  and indeed i must
acknowledge  in honour of those sable destroyers of human rights  that
i never met with any ill treatment  or saw any offered to their
slaves  except tying them  when necessary  to keep them from running
away  when these people knew we were brother and sister they indulged
us together  and the man  to whom i supposed we belonged  lay with us 
he in the middle  while she and i held one another by the hands across
his breast all night  and thus for a while we forgot our misfortunes
in the joy of being together  but even this small comfort was soon to
have an end  for scarcely had the fatal morning appeared  when she was
again torn from me for ever  i was now more miserable  if possible 
than before  the small relief which her presence gave me from pain was
gone  and the wretchedness of my situation was redoubled by my anxiety
after her fate  and my apprehensions lest her sufferings should be
greater than mine  when i could not be with her to alleviate them 
yes  thou dear partner of all my childish sports  thou sharer of my
joys and sorrows  happy should i have ever esteemed myself to
encounter every misery for you  and to procure your freedom by the
sacrifice of my own  though you were early forced from my arms  your
image has been always rivetted in my heart  from which neither  time
nor fortune  have been able to remove it  so that  while the thoughts
of your sufferings have damped my prosperity  they have mingled with
adversity and increased its bitterness  to that heaven which protects
the weak from the strong  i commit the care of your innocence and
virtues  if they have not already received their full reward  and if
your youth and delicacy have not long since fallen victims to the
violence of the african trader  the pestilential stench of a guinea
ship  the seasoning in the european colonies  or the lash and lust of
a brutal and unrelenting overseer 

i did not long remain after my sister  i was again sold  and carried
through a number of places  till  after travelling a considerable
time  i came to a town called tinmah  in the most beautiful country i
have yet seen in africa  it was extremely rich  and there were many
rivulets which flowed through it  and supplied a large pond in the
centre of the town  where the people washed  here i first saw and
tasted cocoa nuts  which i thought superior to any nuts i had ever
tasted before  and the trees  which were loaded  were also
interspersed amongst the houses  which had commodious shades
adjoining  and were in the same manner as ours  the insides being
neatly plastered and whitewashed  here i also saw and tasted for the
first time sugar cane  their money consisted of little white shells 
the size of the finger nail  i was sold here for one hundred and
seventy two of them by a merchant who lived and brought me there  i
had been about two or three days at his house  when a wealthy widow  a
neighbour of his  came there one evening  and brought with her an only
son  a young gentleman about my own age and size  here they saw me 
and  having taken a fancy to me  i was bought of the merchant  and
went home with them  her house and premises were situated close to one
of those rivulets i have mentioned  and were the finest i ever saw in
africa  they were very extensive  and she had a number of slaves to
attend her  the next day i was washed and perfumed  and when meal time
came i was led into the presence of my mistress  and ate and drank
before her with her son  this filled me with astonishment  and i could
scarce help expressing my surprise that the young gentleman should
suffer me  who was bound  to eat with him who was free  and not only
so  but that he would not at any time either eat or drink till i had
taken first  because i was the eldest  which was agreeable to our
custom  indeed every thing here  and all their treatment of me  made
me forget that i was a slave  the language of these people resembled
ours so nearly  that we understood each other perfectly  they had also
the very same customs as we  there were likewise slaves daily to
attend us  while my young master and i with other boys sported with
our darts and bows and arrows  as i had been used to do at home  in
this resemblance to my former happy state i passed about two months 
and i now began to think i was to be adopted into the family  and was
beginning to be reconciled to my situation  and to forget by degrees
my misfortunes  when all at once the delusion vanished  for  without
the least previous knowledge  one morning early  while my dear master
and companion was still asleep  i was wakened out of my reverie to
fresh sorrow  and hurried away even amongst the uncircumcised 

thus  at the very moment i dreamed of the greatest happiness  i found
myself most miserable  and it seemed as if fortune wished to give me
this taste of joy  only to render the reverse more poignant  the
change i now experienced was as painful as it was sudden and
unexpected  it was a change indeed from a state of bliss to a scene
which is inexpressible by me  as it discovered to me an element i had
never before beheld  and till then had no idea of  and wherein such
instances of hardship and cruelty continually occurred as i can never
reflect on but with horror 

all the nations and people i had hitherto passed through resembled our
own in their manners  customs  and language  but i came at length to a
country  the inhabitants of which differed from us in all those
particulars  i was very much struck with this difference  especially
when i came among a people who did not circumcise  and ate without
washing their hands  they cooked also in iron pots  and had european
cutlasses and cross bows  which were unknown to us  and fought with
their fists amongst themselves  their women were not so modest as
ours  for they ate  and drank  and slept  with their men  but  above
all  i was amazed to see no sacrifices or offerings among them  in
some of those places the people ornamented themselves with scars  and
likewise filed their teeth very sharp  they wanted sometimes to
ornament me in the same manner  but i would not suffer them  hoping
that i might some time be among a people who did not thus disfigure
themselves  as i thought they did  at last i came to the banks of a
large river  which was covered with canoes  in which the people
appeared to live with their household utensils and provisions of all
kinds  i was beyond measure astonished at this  as i had never before
seen any water larger than a pond or a rivulet  and my surprise was
mingled with no small fear when i was put into one of these canoes 
and we began to paddle and move along the river  we continued going on
thus till night  and when we came to land  and made fires on the
banks  each family by themselves  some dragged their canoes on shore 
others stayed and cooked in theirs  and laid in them all night  those
on the land had mats  of which they made tents  some in the shape of
little houses  in these we slept  and after the morning meal we
embarked again and proceeded as before  i was often very much
astonished to see some of the women  as well as the men  jump into the
water  dive to the bottom  come up again  and swim about  thus i
continued to travel  sometimes by land  sometimes by water  through
different countries and various nations  till  at the end of six or
seven months after i had been kidnapped  i arrived at the sea coast 
it would be tedious and uninteresting to relate all the incidents
which befell me during this journey  and which i have not yet
forgotten  of the various hands i passed through  and the manners and
customs of all the different people among whom i lived  i shall
therefore only observe  that in all the places where i was the soil
was exceedingly rich  the pomkins  eadas  plantains  yams   c   c 
were in great abundance  and of incredible size  there were also vast
quantities of different gums  though not used for any purpose  and
every where a great deal of tobacco  the cotton even grew quite wild 
and there was plenty of redwood  i saw no mechanics whatever in all
the way  except such as i have mentioned  the chief employment in all
these countries was agriculture  and both the males and females  as
with us  were brought up to it  and trained in the arts of war 

the first object which saluted my eyes when i arrived on the coast was
the sea  and a slave ship  which was then riding at anchor  and
waiting for its cargo  these filled me with astonishment  which was
soon converted into terror when i was carried on board  i was
immediately handled and tossed up to see if i were sound by some of
the crew  and i was now persuaded that i had gotten into a world of
bad spirits  and that they were going to kill me  their complexions
too differing so much from ours  their long hair  and the language
they spoke   which was very different from any i had ever heard 
united to confirm me in this belief  indeed such were the horrors of
my views and fears at the moment  that  if ten thousand worlds had
been my own  i would have freely parted with them all to have
exchanged my condition with that of the meanest slave in my own
country  when i looked round the ship too and saw a large furnace or
copper boiling  and a multitude of black people of every description
chained together  every one of their countenances expressing dejection
and sorrow  i no longer doubted of my fate  and  quite overpowered
with horror and anguish  i fell motionless on the deck and fainted 
when i recovered a little i found some black people about me  who i
believed were some of those who brought me on board  and had been
receiving their pay  they talked to me in order to cheer me  but all
in vain  i asked them if we were not to be eaten by those white men
with horrible looks  red faces  and loose hair  they told me i was
not  and one of the crew brought me a small portion of spirituous
liquor in a wine glass  but  being afraid of him  i would not take it
out of his hand  one of the blacks therefore took it from him and gave
it to me  and i took a little down my palate  which  instead of
reviving me  as they thought it would  threw me into the greatest
consternation at the strange feeling it produced  having never tasted
any such liquor before  soon after this the blacks who brought me on
board went off  and left me abandoned to despair  i now saw myself
deprived of all chance of returning to my native country  or even the
least glimpse of hope of gaining the shore  which i now considered as
friendly  and i even wished for my former slavery in preference to my
present situation  which was filled with horrors of every kind  still
heightened by my ignorance of what i was to undergo  i was not long
suffered to indulge my grief  i was soon put down under the decks  and
there i received such a salutation in my nostrils as i had never
experienced in my life  so that  with the loathsomeness of the stench 
and crying together  i became so sick and low that i was not able to
eat  nor had i the least desire to taste any thing  i now wished for
the last friend  death  to relieve me  but soon  to my grief  two of
the white men offered me eatables  and  on my refusing to eat  one of
them held me fast by the hands  and laid me across i think the
windlass  and tied my feet  while the other flogged me severely  i had
never experienced any thing of this kind before  and although  not
being used to the water  i naturally feared that element the first
time i saw it  yet nevertheless  could i have got over the nettings 
i would have jumped over the side  but i could not  and  besides  the
crew used to watch us very closely who were not chained down to the
decks  lest we should leap into the water  and i have seen some of
these poor african prisoners most severely cut for attempting to do
so  and hourly whipped for not eating  this indeed was often the case
with myself  in a little time after  amongst the poor chained men  i
found some of my own nation  which in a small degree gave ease to my
mind  i inquired of these what was to be done with us  they gave me to
understand we were to be carried to these white people s country to
work for them  i then was a little revived  and thought  if it were no
worse than working  my situation was not so desperate  but still i
feared i should be put to death  the white people looked and acted  as
i thought  in so savage a manner  for i had never seen among any
people such instances of brutal cruelty  and this not only shewn
towards us blacks  but also to some of the whites themselves  one
white man in particular i saw  when we were permitted to be on deck 
flogged so unmercifully with a large rope near the foremast  that he
died in consequence of it  and they tossed him over the side as they
would have done a brute  this made me fear these people the more  and
i expected nothing less than to be treated in the same manner  i could
not help expressing my fears and apprehensions to some of my
countrymen  i asked them if these people had no country  but lived in
this hollow place  the ship   they told me they did not  but came from
a distant one   then   said i   how comes it in all our country we
never heard of them   they told me because they lived so very far off 
i then asked where were their women  had they any like themselves  i
was told they had   and why   said i   do we not see them   they
answered  because they were left behind  i asked how the vessel could
go  they told me they could not tell  but that there were cloths put
upon the masts by the help of the ropes i saw  and then the vessel
went on  and the white men had some spell or magic they put in the
water when they liked in order to stop the vessel  i was exceedingly
amazed at this account  and really thought they were spirits  i
therefore wished much to be from amongst them  for i expected they
would sacrifice me  but my wishes were vain  for we were so quartered
that it was impossible for any of us to make our escape  while we
stayed on the coast i was mostly on deck  and one day  to my great
astonishment  i saw one of these vessels coming in with the sails up 
as soon as the whites saw it  they gave a great shout  at which we
were amazed  and the more so as the vessel appeared larger by
approaching nearer  at last she came to an anchor in my sight  and
when the anchor was let go i and my countrymen who saw it were lost in
astonishment to observe the vessel stop  and were not convinced it was
done by magic  soon after this the other ship got her boats out  and
they came on board of us  and the people of both ships seemed very
glad to see each other  several of the strangers also shook hands with
us black people  and made motions with their hands  signifying i
suppose we were to go to their country  but we did not understand
them  at last  when the ship we were in had got in all her cargo  they
made ready with many fearful noises  and we were all put under deck 
so that we could not see how they managed the vessel  but this
disappointment was the least of my sorrow  the stench of the hold
while we were on the coast was so intolerably loathsome  that it was
dangerous to remain there for any time  and some of us had been
permitted to stay on the deck for the fresh air  but now that the
whole ship s cargo were confined together  it became absolutely
pestilential  the closeness of the place  and the heat of the climate 
added to the number in the ship  which was so crowded that each had
scarcely room to turn himself  almost suffocated us  this produced
copious perspirations  so that the air soon became unfit for
respiration  from a variety of loathsome smells  and brought on a
sickness among the slaves  of which many died  thus falling victims to
the improvident avarice  as i may call it  of their purchasers  this
wretched situation was again aggravated by the galling of the chains 
now become insupportable  and the filth of the necessary tubs  into
which the children often fell  and were almost suffocated  the shrieks
of the women  and the groans of the dying  rendered the whole a scene
of horror almost inconceivable  happily perhaps for myself i was soon
reduced so low here that it was thought necessary to keep me almost
always on deck  and from my extreme youth i was not put in fetters  in
this situation i expected every hour to share the fate of my
companions  some of whom were almost daily brought upon deck at the
point of death  which i began to hope would soon put an end to my
miseries  often did i think many of the inhabitants of the deep much
more happy than myself  i envied them the freedom they enjoyed  and as
often wished i could change my condition for theirs  every
circumstance i met with served only to render my state more painful 
and heighten my apprehensions  and my opinion of the cruelty of the
whites  one day they had taken a number of fishes  and when they had
killed and satisfied themselves with as many as they thought fit  to
our astonishment who were on the deck  rather than give any of them to
us to eat as we expected  they tossed the remaining fish into the sea
again  although we begged and prayed for some as well as we could  but
in vain  and some of my countrymen  being pressed by hunger  took an
opportunity  when they thought no one saw them  of trying to get a
little privately  but they were discovered  and the attempt procured
them some very severe floggings  one day  when we had a smooth sea and
moderate wind  two of my wearied countrymen who were chained together
 i was near them at the time   preferring death to such a life of
misery  somehow made through the nettings and jumped into the sea 
immediately another quite dejected fellow  who  on account of his
illness  was suffered to be out of irons  also followed their example 
and i believe many more would very soon have done the same if they had
not been prevented by the ship s crew  who were instantly alarmed 
those of us that were the most active were in a moment put down under
the deck  and there was such a noise and confusion amongst the people
of the ship as i never heard before  to stop her  and get the boat out
to go after the slaves  however two of the wretches were drowned  but
they got the other  and afterwards flogged him unmercifully for thus
attempting to prefer death to slavery  in this manner we continued to
undergo more hardships than i can now relate  hardships which are
inseparable from this accursed trade  many a time we were near
suffocation from the want of fresh air  which we were often without
for whole days together  this  and the stench of the necessary tubs 
carried off many  during our passage i first saw flying fishes  which
surprised me very much  they used frequently to fly across the ship 
and many of them fell on the deck  i also now first saw the use of the
quadrant  i had often with astonishment seen the mariners make
observations with it  and i could not think what it meant  they at
last took notice of my surprise  and one of them  willing to increase
it  as well as to gratify my curiosity  made me one day look through
it  the clouds appeared to me to be land  which disappeared as they
passed along  this heightened my wonder  and i was now more persuaded
than ever that i was in another world  and that every thing about me
was magic  at last we came in sight of the island of barbadoes  at
which the whites on board gave a great shout  and made many signs of
joy to us  we did not know what to think of this  but as the vessel
drew nearer we plainly saw the harbour  and other ships of different
kinds and sizes  and we soon anchored amongst them off bridge town 
many merchants and planters now came on board  though it was in the
evening  they put us in separate parcels  and examined us attentively 
they also made us jump  and pointed to the land  signifying we were to
go there  we thought by this we should be eaten by these ugly men  as
they appeared to us  and  when soon after we were all put down under
the deck again  there was much dread and trembling among us  and
nothing but bitter cries to be heard all the night from these
apprehensions  insomuch that at last the white people got some old
slaves from the land to pacify us  they told us we were not to be
eaten  but to work  and were soon to go on land  where we should see
many of our country people  this report eased us much  and sure
enough  soon after we were landed  there came to us africans of all
languages  we were conducted immediately to the merchant s yard  where
we were all pent up together like so many sheep in a fold  without
regard to sex or age  as every object was new to me every thing i saw
filled me with surprise  what struck me first was that the houses were
built with stories  and in every other respect different from those in
africa  but i was still more astonished on seeing people on horseback 
i did not know what this could mean  and indeed i thought these people
were full of nothing but magical arts  while i was in this
astonishment one of my fellow prisoners spoke to a countryman of his
about the horses  who said they were the same kind they had in their
country  i understood them  though they were from a distant part of
africa  and i thought it odd i had not seen any horses there  but
afterwards  when i came to converse with different africans  i found
they had many horses amongst them  and much larger than those i then
saw  we were not many days in the merchant s custody before we were
sold after their usual manner  which is this   on a signal given  as
the beat of a drum  the buyers rush at once into the yard where the
slaves are confined  and make choice of that parcel they like best 
the noise and clamour with which this is attended  and the eagerness
visible in the countenances of the buyers  serve not a little to
increase the apprehensions of the terrified africans  who may well be
supposed to consider them as the ministers of that destruction to
which they think themselves devoted  in this manner  without scruple 
are relations and friends separated  most of them never to see each
other again  i remember in the vessel in which i was brought over  in
the men s apartment  there were several brothers  who  in the sale 
were sold in different lots  and it was very moving on this occasion
to see and hear their cries at parting  o  ye nominal christians 
might not an african ask you  learned you this from your god  who says
unto you  do unto all men as you would men should do unto you  is it
not enough that we are torn from our country and friends to toil for
your luxury and lust of gain  must every tender feeling be likewise
sacrificed to your avarice  are the dearest friends and relations  now
rendered more dear by their separation from their kindred  still to be
parted from each other  and thus prevented from cheering the gloom of
slavery with the small comfort of being together and mingling their
sufferings and sorrows  why are parents to lose their children 
brothers their sisters  or husbands their wives  surely this is a new
refinement in cruelty  which  while it has no advantage to atone for
it  thus aggravates distress  and adds fresh horrors even to the
wretchedness of slavery

i now totally lost the small remains of comfort i had enjoyed in
conversing with my countrymen  the women too  who used to wash and
take care of me  were all gone different ways  and i never saw one of
them afterwards 

i stayed in this island for a few days  i believe it could not be
above a fortnight  when i and some few more slaves  that were not
saleable amongst the rest  from very much fretting  were shipped off
in a sloop for north america  on the passage we were better treated
than when we were coming from africa  and we had plenty of rice and
fat pork  we were landed up a river a good way from the sea  about
virginia county  where we saw few or none of our native africans  and
not one soul who could talk to me  i was a few weeks weeding grass 
and gathering stones in a plantation  and at last all my companions
were distributed different ways  and only myself was left  i was now
exceedingly miserable  and thought myself worse off than any of the
rest of my companions  for they could talk to each other  but i had no
person to speak to that i could understand  in this state i was
constantly grieving and pining  and wishing for death rather than any
thing else  while i was in this plantation the gentleman  to whom i
suppose the estate belonged  being unwell  i was one day sent for to
his dwelling house to fan him  when i came into the room where he was
i was very much affrighted at some things i saw  and the more so as i
had seen a black woman slave as i came through the house  who was
cooking the dinner  and the poor creature was cruelly loaded with
various kinds of iron machines  she had one particularly on her head 
which locked her mouth so fast that she could scarcely speak  and
could not eat nor drink  i was much astonished and shocked at this
contrivance  which i afterwards learned was called the iron muzzle 
soon after i had a fan put into my hand  to fan the gentleman while he
slept  and so i did indeed with great fear  while he was fast asleep i
indulged myself a great deal in looking about the room  which to me
appeared very fine and curious  the first object that engaged my
attention was a watch which hung on the chimney  and was going  i was
quite surprised at the noise it made  and was afraid it would tell the
gentleman any thing i might do amiss  and when i immediately after
observed a picture hanging in the room  which appeared constantly to
look at me  i was still more affrighted  having never seen such things
as these before  at one time i thought it was something relative to
magic  and not seeing it move i thought it might be some way the
whites had to keep their great men when they died  and offer them
libation as we used to do to our friendly spirits  in this state of
anxiety i remained till my master awoke  when i was dismissed out of
the room  to my no small satisfaction and relief  for i thought that
these people were all made up of wonders  in this place i was called
jacob  but on board the african snow i was called michael  i had been
some time in this miserable  forlorn  and much dejected state  without
having any one to talk to  which made my life a burden  when the kind
and unknown hand of the creator  who in very deed leads the blind in a
way they know not  now began to appear  to my comfort  for one day the
captain of a merchant ship  called the industrious bee  came on some
business to my master s house  this gentleman  whose name was michael
henry pascal  was a lieutenant in the royal navy  but now commanded
this trading ship  which was somewhere in the confines of the county
many miles off  while he was at my master s house it happened that he
saw me  and liked me so well that he made a purchase of me  i think i
have often heard him say he gave thirty or forty pounds sterling for
me  but i do not now remember which  however  he meant me for a
present to some of his friends in england  and i was sent accordingly
from the house of my then master  one mr  campbell  to the place where
the ship lay  i was conducted on horseback by an elderly black man   a
mode of travelling which appeared very odd to me   when i arrived i
was carried on board a fine large ship  loaded with tobacco   c  and
just ready to sail for england  i now thought my condition much
mended  i had sails to lie on  and plenty of good victuals to eat  and
every body on board used me very kindly  quite contrary to what i had
seen of any white people before  i therefore began to think that they
were not all of the same disposition  a few days after i was on board
we sailed for england  i was still at a loss to conjecture my destiny 
by this time  however  i could smatter a little imperfect english  and
i wanted to know as well as i could where we were going  some of the
people of the ship used to tell me they were going to carry me back to
my own country  and this made me very happy  i was quite rejoiced at
the sound of going back  and thought if i should get home what wonders
i should have to tell  but i was reserved for another fate  and was
soon undeceived when we came within sight of the english coast  while
i was on board this ship  my captain and master named me  gustavus
vassa   i at that time began to understand him a little  and refused to
be called so  and told him as well as i could that i would be called
jacob  but he said i should not  and still called me gustavus  and
when i refused to answer to my new name  which at first i did  it
gained me many a cuff  so at length i submitted  and was obliged to
bear the present name  by which i have been known ever since  the ship
had a very long passage  and on that account we had very short
allowance of provisions  towards the last we had only one pound and a
half of bread per week  and about the same quantity of meat  and one
quart of water a day  we spoke with only one vessel the whole time we
were at sea  and but once we caught a few fishes  in our extremities
the captain and people told me in jest they would kill and eat me  but
i thought them in earnest  and was depressed beyond measure  expecting
every moment to be my last  while i was in this situation one evening
they caught  with a good deal of trouble  a large shark  and got it on
board  this gladdened my poor heart exceedingly  as i thought it would
serve the people to eat instead of their eating me  but very soon  to
my astonishment  they cut off a small part of the tail  and tossed the
rest over the side  this renewed my consternation  and i did not know
what to think of these white people  though i very much feared they
would kill and eat me  there was on board the ship a young lad who had
never been at sea before  about four or five years older than myself 
his name was richard baker  he was a native of america  had received
an excellent education  and was of a most amiable temper  soon after i
went on board he shewed me a great deal of partiality and attention 
and in return i grew extremely fond of him  we at length became
inseparable  and  for the space of two years  he was of very great use
to me  and was my constant companion and instructor  although this
dear youth had many slaves of his own  yet he and i have gone through
many sufferings together on shipboard  and we have many nights lain in
each other s bosoms when we were in great distress  thus such a
friendship was cemented between us as we cherished till his death 
which  to my very great sorrow  happened in the year       when he was
up the archipelago  on board his majesty s ship the preston  an event
which i have never ceased to regret  as i lost at once a kind
interpreter  an agreeable companion  and a faithful friend  who  at
the age of fifteen  discovered a mind superior to prejudice  and who
was not ashamed to notice  to associate with  and to be the friend and
instructor of one who was ignorant  a stranger  of a different
complexion  and a slave  my master had lodged in his mother s house in
america  he respected him very much  and made him always eat with him
in the cabin  he used often to tell him jocularly that he would kill
me to eat  sometimes he would say to me  the black people were not
good to eat  and would ask me if we did not eat people in my country 
i said  no  then he said he would kill dick  as he always called him 
first  and afterwards me  though this hearing relieved my mind a
little as to myself  i was alarmed for dick and whenever he was called
i used to be very much afraid he was to be killed  and i would peep
and watch to see if they were going to kill him  nor was i free from
this consternation till we made the land  one night we lost a man
overboard  and the cries and noise were so great and confused  in
stopping the ship  that i  who did not know what was the matter 
began  as usual  to be very much afraid  and to think they were going
to make an offering with me  and perform some magic  which i still
believed they dealt in  as the waves were very high i thought the
ruler of the seas was angry  and i expected to be offered up to
appease him  this filled my mind with agony  and i could not any more
that night close my eyes again to rest  however  when daylight
appeared i was a little eased in my mind  but still every time i was
called i used to think it was to be killed  some time after this we
saw some very large fish  which i afterwards found were called
grampusses  they looked to me extremely terrible  and made their
appearance just at dusk  and were so near as to blow the water on the
ship s deck  i believed them to be the rulers of the sea  and  as the
white people did not make any offerings at any time  i thought they
were angry with them  and  at last  what confirmed my belief was  the
wind just then died away  and a calm ensued  and in consequence of it
the ship stopped going  i supposed that the fish had performed this 
and i hid myself in the fore part of the ship  through fear of being
offered up to appease them  every minute peeping and quaking  but my
good friend dick came shortly towards me  and i took an opportunity to
ask him  as well as i could  what these fish were  not being able to
talk much english  i could but just make him understand my question 
and not at all  when i asked him if any offerings were to be made to
them  however  he told me these fish would swallow any body  which
sufficiently alarmed me  here he was called away by the captain  who
was leaning over the quarter deck railing and looking at the fish  and
most of the people were busied in getting a barrel of pitch to light 
for them to play with  the captain now called me to him  having
learned some of my apprehensions from dick  and having diverted
himself and others for some time with my fears  which appeared
ludicrous enough in my crying and trembling  he dismissed me  the
barrel of pitch was now lighted and put over the side into the water 
by this time it was just dark  and the fish went after it  and  to my
great joy  i saw them no more 

however  all my alarms began to subside when we got sight of land  and
at last the ship arrived at falmouth  after a passage of thirteen
weeks  every heart on board seemed gladdened on our reaching the
shore  and none more than mine  the captain immediately went on shore 
and sent on board some fresh provisions  which we wanted very much 
we made good use of them  and our famine was soon turned into
feasting  almost without ending  it was about the beginning of the
spring      when i arrived in england  and i was near twelve years of
age at that time  i was very much struck with the buildings and the
pavement of the streets in falmouth  and  indeed  any object i saw
filled me with new surprise  one morning  when i got upon deck  i saw
it covered all over with the snow that fell over night  as i had never
seen any thing of the kind before  i thought it was salt  so i
immediately ran down to the mate and desired him  as well as i could 
to come and see how somebody in the night had thrown salt all over the
deck  he  knowing what it was  desired me to bring some of it down to
him  accordingly i took up a handful of it  which i found very cold
indeed  and when i brought it to him he desired me to taste it  i did
so  and i was surprised beyond measure  i then asked him what it was 
he told me it was snow  but i could not in anywise understand him  he
asked me if we had no such thing in my country  and i told him  no  i
then asked him the use of it  and who made it  he told me a great man
in the heavens  called god  but here again i was to all intents and
purposes at a loss to understand him  and the more so  when a little
after i saw the air filled with it  in a heavy shower  which fell down
on the same day  after this i went to church  and having never been at
such a place before  i was again amazed at seeing and hearing the
service  i asked all i could about it  and they gave me to understand
it was worshipping god  who made us and all things  i was still at a
great loss  and soon got into an endless field of inquiries  as well
as i was able to speak and ask about things  however  my little friend
dick used to be my best interpreter  for i could make free with him 
and he always instructed me with pleasure  and from what i could
understand by him of this god  and in seeing these white people did
not sell one another  as we did  i was much pleased  and in this i
thought they were much happier than we africans  i was astonished at
the wisdom of the white people in all things i saw  but was amazed at
their not sacrificing  or making any offerings  and eating with
unwashed hands  and touching the dead  i likewise could not help
remarking the particular slenderness of their women  which i did not
at first like  and i thought they were not so modest and shamefaced as
the african women 

i had often seen my master and dick employed in reading  and i had a
great curiosity to talk to the books  as i thought they did  and so to
learn how all things had a beginning  for that purpose i have often
taken up a book  and have talked to it  and then put my ears to it 
when alone  in hopes it would answer me  and i have been very much
concerned when i found it remained silent 

my master lodged at the house of a gentleman in falmouth  who had a
fine little daughter about six or seven years of age  and she grew
prodigiously fond of me  insomuch that we used to eat together  and
had servants to wait on us  i was so much caressed by this family that
it often reminded me of the treatment i had received from my little
noble african master  after i had been here a few days  i was sent on
board of the ship  but the child cried so much after me that nothing
could pacify her till i was sent for again  it is ludicrous enough 
that i began to fear i should be betrothed to this young lady  and
when my master asked me if i would stay there with her behind him  as
he was going away with the ship  which had taken in the tobacco again 
i cried immediately  and said i would not leave her  at last  by
stealth  one night i was sent on board the ship again  and in a little
time we sailed for guernsey  where she was in part owned by a
merchant  one nicholas doberry  as i was now amongst a people who had
not their faces scarred  like some of the african nations where i had
been  i was very glad i did not let them ornament me in that manner
when i was with them  when we arrived at guernsey  my master placed me
to board and lodge with one of his mates  who had a wife and family
there  and some months afterwards he went to england  and left me in
care of this mate  together with my friend dick  this mate had a
little daughter  aged about five or six years  with whom i used to be
much delighted  i had often observed that when her mother washed her
face it looked very rosy  but when she washed mine it did not look so 
i therefore tried oftentimes myself if i could not by washing make my
face of the same colour as my little play mate  mary   but it was all
in vain  and i now began to be mortified at the difference in our
complexions  this woman behaved to me with great kindness and
attention  and taught me every thing in the same manner as she did her
own child  and indeed in every respect treated me as such  i remained
here till the summer of the year       when my master  being appointed
first lieutenant of his majesty s ship the roebuck  sent for dick and
me  and his old mate  on this we all left guernsey  and set out for
england in a sloop bound for london  as we were coming up towards the
nore  where the roebuck lay  a man of war s boat came alongside to
press our people  on which each man ran to hide himself  i was very
much frightened at this  though i did not know what it meant  or what
to think or do  however i went and hid myself also under a hencoop 
immediately afterwards the press gang came on board with their swords
drawn  and searched all about  pulled the people out by force  and put
them into the boat  at last i was found out also  the man that found
me held me up by the heels while they all made their sport of me  i
roaring and crying out all the time most lustily  but at last the
mate  who was my conductor  seeing this  came to my assistance  and
did all he could to pacify me  but all to very little purpose  till i
had seen the boat go off  soon afterwards we came to the nore  where
the roebuck lay  and  to our great joy  my master came on board to us 
and brought us to the ship  when i went on board this large ship  i
was amazed indeed to see the quantity of men and the guns  however my
surprise began to diminish as my knowledge increased  and i ceased to
feel those apprehensions and alarms which had taken such strong
possession of me when i first came among the europeans  and for some
time after  i began now to pass to an opposite extreme  i was so far
from being afraid of any thing new which i saw  that  after i had been
some time in this ship  i even began to long for a battle  my griefs
too  which in young minds are not perpetual  were now wearing away 
and i soon enjoyed myself pretty well  and felt tolerably easy in my
present situation  there was a number of boys on board  which still
made it more agreeable  for we were always together  and a great part
of our time was spent in play  i remained in this ship a considerable
time  during which we made several cruises  and visited a variety of
places  among others we were twice in holland  and brought over
several persons of distinction from it  whose names i do not now
remember  on the passage  one day  for the diversion of those
gentlemen  all the boys were called on the quarter deck  and were
paired proportionably  and then made to fight  after which the
gentleman gave the combatants from five to nine shillings each  this
was the first time i ever fought with a white boy  and i never knew
what it was to have a bloody nose before  this made me fight most
desperately  i suppose considerably more than an hour  and at last 
both of us being weary  we were parted  i had a great deal of this
kind of sport afterwards  in which the captain and the ship s company
used very much to encourage me  sometime afterwards the ship went to
leith in scotland  and from thence to the orkneys  where i was
surprised in seeing scarcely any night  and from thence we sailed with
a great fleet  full of soldiers  for england  all this time we had
never come to an engagement  though we were frequently cruising off
the coast of france  during which we chased many vessels  and took in
all seventeen prizes  i had been learning many of the manoeuvres of
the ship during our cruise  and i was several times made to fire the
guns  one evening  off havre de grace  just as it was growing dark  we
were standing off shore  and met with a fine large french built
frigate  we got all things immediately ready for fighting  and i now
expected i should be gratified in seeing an engagement  which i had so
long wished for in vain  but the very moment the word of command was
given to fire we heard those on board the other ship cry  haul down
the jib   and in that instant she hoisted english colours  there was
instantly with us an amazing cry of  avast  or stop firing  and i
think one or two guns had been let off  but happily they did no
mischief  we had hailed them several times  but they not hearing  we
received no answer  which was the cause of our firing  the boat was
then sent on board of her  and she proved to be the ambuscade man of
war  to my no small disappointment  we returned to portsmouth  without
having been in any action  just at the trial of admiral byng  whom i
saw several times during it   and my master having left the ship  and
gone to london for promotion  dick and i were put on board the savage
sloop of war  and we went in her to assist in bringing off the st 
george man of war  that had ran ashore somewhere on the coast  after
staying a few weeks on board the savage  dick and i were sent on shore
at deal  where we remained some short time  till my master sent for us
to london  the place i had long desired exceedingly to see  we
therefore both with great pleasure got into a waggon  and came to
london  where we were received by a mr  guerin  a relation of my
master  this gentleman had two sisters  very amiable ladies  who took
much notice and great care of me  though i had desired so much to see
london  when i arrived in it i was unfortunately unable to gratify my
curiosity  for i had at this time the chilblains to such a degree that
i could not stand for several months  and i was obliged to be sent to
st  george s hospital  there i grew so ill  that the doctors wanted to
cut my left leg off at different times  apprehending a mortification 
but i always said i would rather die than suffer it  and happily  i
thank god  i recovered without the operation  after being there
several weeks  and just as i had recovered  the small pox broke out on
me  so that i was again confined  and i thought myself now
particularly unfortunate  however i soon recovered again  and by this
time my master having been promoted to be first lieutenant of the
preston man of war of fifty guns  then new at deptford  dick and i
were sent on board her  and soon after we went to holland to bring
over the late duke of      to england   while i was in this ship an
incident happened  which  though trifling  i beg leave to relate  as i
could not help taking particular notice of it  and considering it then
as a judgment of god  one morning a young man was looking up to the
fore top  and in a wicked tone  common on shipboard  d    d his eyes
about something  just at the moment some small particles of dirt fell
into his left eye  and by the evening it was very much inflamed  the
next day it grew worse  and within six or seven days he lost it  from
this ship my master was appointed a lieutenant on board the royal
george  when he was going he wished me to stay on board the preston 
to learn the french horn  but the ship being ordered for turkey i
could not think of leaving my master  to whom i was very warmly
attached  and i told him if he left me behind it would break my heart 
this prevailed on him to take me with him  but he left dick on board
the preston  whom i embraced at parting for the last time  the royal
george was the largest ship i had ever seen  so that when i came on
board of her i was surprised at the number of people  men  women  and
children  of every denomination  and the largeness of the guns  many
of them also of brass  which i had never seen before  here were also
shops or stalls of every kind of goods  and people crying their
different commodities about the ship as in a town  to me it appeared a
little world  into which i was again cast without a friend  for i had
no longer my dear companion dick  we did not stay long here  my master
was not many weeks on board before he got an appointment to be sixth
lieutenant of the namur  which was then at spithead  fitting up for
vice admiral boscawen  who was going with a large fleet on an
expedition against louisburgh  the crew of the royal george were
turned over to her  and the flag of that gallant admiral was hoisted
on board  the blue at the maintop gallant mast head  there was a very
great fleet of men of war of every description assembled together for
this expedition  and i was in hopes soon to have an opportunity of
being gratified with a sea fight  all things being now in readiness 
this mighty fleet  for there was also admiral cornish s fleet in
company  destined for the east indies  at last weighed anchor  and
sailed  the two fleets continued in company for several days  and then
parted  admiral cornish  in the lenox  having first saluted our
admiral in the namur  which he returned  we then steered for america 
but  by contrary winds  we were driven to teneriffe  where i was
struck with its noted peak  its prodigious height  and its form 
resembling a sugar loaf  filled me with wonder  we remained in sight
of this island some days  and then proceeded for america  which we
soon made  and got into a very commodious harbour called st  george 
in halifax  where we had fish in great plenty  and all other fresh
provisions  we were here joined by different men of war and transport
ships with soldiers  after which  our fleet being increased to a
prodigious number of ships of all kinds  we sailed for cape breton in
nova scotia  we had the good and gallant general wolfe on board our
ship  whose affability made him highly esteemed and beloved by all the
men  he often honoured me  as well as other boys  with marks of his
notice  and saved me once a flogging for fighting with a young
gentleman  we arrived at cape breton in the summer of       and here
the soldiers were to be landed  in order to make an attack upon
louisbourgh  my master had some part in superintending the landing 
and here i was in a small measure gratified in seeing an encounter
between our men and the enemy  the french were posted on the shore to
receive us  and disputed our landing for a long time  but at last they
were driven from their trenches  and a complete landing was effected 
our troops pursued them as far as the town of louisbourgh  in this
action many were killed on both sides  one thing remarkable i saw this
day   a lieutenant of the princess amelia  who  as well as my master 
superintended the landing  was giving the word of command  and while
his mouth was open a musquet ball went through it  and passed out at
his cheek  i had that day in my hand the scalp of an indian king  who
was killed in the engagement  the scalp had been taken off by an
highlander  i saw this king s ornaments too  which were very curious 
and made of feathers 

our land forces laid siege to the town of louisbourgh  while the
french men of war were blocked up in the harbour by the fleet  the
batteries at the same time playing upon them from the land  this they
did with such effect  that one day i saw some of the ships set on fire
by the shells from the batteries  and i believe two or three of them
were quite burnt  at another time  about fifty boats belonging to the
english men of war  commanded by captain george balfour of the  tna
fire ship  and another junior captain  laforey  attacked and boarded
the only two remaining french men of war in the harbour  they also set
fire to a seventy gun ship  but a sixty four  called the bienfaisant 
they brought off  during my stay here i had often an opportunity of
being near captain balfour  who was pleased to notice me  and liked me
so much that he often asked my master to let him have me  but he would
not part with me  and no consideration could have induced me to leave
him  at last louisbourgh was taken  and the english men of war came
into the harbour before it  to my very great joy  for i had now more
liberty of indulging myself  and i went often on shore  when the ships
were in the harbour we had the most beautiful procession on the water
i ever saw  all the admirals and captains of the men of war  full
dressed  and in their barges  well ornamented with pendants  came
alongside of the namur  the vice admiral then went on shore in his
barge  followed by the other officers in order of seniority  to take
possession  as i suppose  of the town and fort  some time after this
the french governor and his lady  and other persons of note  came on
board our ship to dine  on this occasion our ships were dressed with
colours of all kinds  from the topgallant mast head to the deck  and
this  with the firing of guns  formed a most grand and magnificent
spectacle 

as soon as every thing here was settled admiral boscawen sailed with
part of the fleet for england  leaving some ships behind with
rear admirals sir charles hardy and durell  it was now winter  and one
evening  during our passage home  about dusk  when we were in the
channel  or near soundings  and were beginning to look for land  we
descried seven sail of large men of war  which stood off shore 
several people on board of our ship said  as the two fleets were  in
forty minutes from the first sight  within hail of each other  that
they were english men of war  and some of our people even began to
name some of the ships  by this time both fleets began to mingle  and
our admiral ordered his flag to be hoisted  at that instant the other
fleet  which were french  hoisted their ensigns  and gave us a
broadside as they passed by  nothing could create greater surprise and
confusion among us than this  the wind was high  the sea rough  and we
had our lower and middle deck guns housed in  so that not a single gun
on board was ready to be fired at any of the french ships  however 
the royal william and the somerset being our sternmost ships  became a
little prepared  and each gave the french ships a broadside as they
passed by  i afterwards heard this was a french squadron  commanded by
mons  conflans  and certainly had the frenchmen known our condition 
and had a mind to fight us  they might have done us great mischief 
but we were not long before we were prepared for an engagement 
immediately many things were tossed overboard  the ships were made
ready for fighting as soon as possible  and about ten at night we had
bent a new main sail  the old one being split  being now in readiness
for fighting  we wore ship  and stood after the french fleet  who
were one or two ships in number more than we  however we gave them
chase  and continued pursuing them all night  and at daylight we saw
six of them  all large ships of the line  and an english east
indiaman  a prize they had taken  we chased them all day till between
three and four o clock in the evening  when we came up with  and
passed within a musquet shot of  one seventy four gun ship  and the
indiaman also  who now hoisted her colours  but immediately hauled
them down again  on this we made a signal for the other ships to take
possession of her  and  supposing the man of war would likewise
strike  we cheered  but she did not  though if we had fired into her 
from being so near  we must have taken her  to my utter surprise the
somerset  who was the next ship astern of the namur  made way
likewise  and  thinking they were sure of this french ship  they
cheered in the same manner  but still continued to follow us  the
french commodore was about a gun shot ahead of all  running from us
with all speed  and about four o clock he carried his foretopmast
overboard  this caused another loud cheer with us  and a little after
the topmast came close by us  but  to our great surprise  instead of
coming up with her  we found she went as fast as ever  if not faster 
the sea grew now much smoother  and the wind lulling  the seventy four
gun ship we had passed came again by us in the very same direction 
and so near  that we heard her people talk as she went by  yet not a
shot was fired on either side  and about five or six o clock  just as
it grew dark  she joined her commodore  we chased all night  but the
next day they were out of sight  so that we saw no more of them  and
we only had the old indiaman  called carnarvon i think  for our
trouble  after this we stood in for the channel  and soon made the
land  and  about the close of the year         we got safe to st 
helen s  here the namur ran aground  and also another large ship
astern of us  but  by starting our water  and tossing many things
overboard to lighten her  we got the ships off without any damage  we
stayed for a short time at spithead  and then went into portsmouth
harbour to refit  from whence the admiral went to london  and my
master and i soon followed  with a press gang  as we wanted some hands
to complete our complement

it was now between two and three years since i first came to england 
a great part of which i had spent at sea  so that i became inured to
that service  and began to consider myself as happily situated  for my
master treated me always extremely well  and my attachment and
gratitude to him were very great  from the various scenes i had beheld
on shipboard  i soon grew a stranger to terror of every kind  and was 
in that respect at least  almost an englishman  i have often reflected
with surprise that i never felt half the alarm at any of the numerous
dangers i have been in  that i was filled with at the first sight of
the europeans  and at every act of theirs  even the most trifling 
when i first came among them  and for some time afterwards  that fear 
however  which was the effect of my ignorance  wore away as i began to
know them  i could now speak english tolerably well  and i perfectly
understood every thing that was said  i now not only felt myself
quite easy with these new countrymen  but relished their society and
manners  i no longer looked upon them as spirits  but as men superior
to us  and therefore i had the stronger desire to resemble them  to
imbibe their spirit  and imitate their manners  i therefore embraced
every occasion of improvement  and every new thing that i observed i
treasured up in my memory  i had long wished to be able to read and
write  and for this purpose i took every opportunity to gain
instruction  but had made as yet very little progress  however  when i
went to london with my master  i had soon an opportunity of improving
myself  which i gladly embraced  shortly after my arrival  he sent me
to wait upon the miss guerins  who had treated me with much kindness
when i was there before  and they sent me to school 

while i was attending these ladies their servants told me i could not
go to heaven unless i was baptized  this made me very uneasy  for i
had now some faint idea of a future state  accordingly i communicated
my anxiety to the eldest miss guerin  with whom i was become a
favourite  and pressed her to have me baptized  when to my great joy
she told me i should  she had formerly asked my master to let me be
baptized  but he had refused  however she now insisted on it  and he
being under some obligation to her brother complied with her request 
so i was baptized in st  margaret s church  westminster  in february
      by my present name  the clergyman  at the same time  gave me a
book  called a guide to the indians  written by the bishop of sodor
and man  on this occasion miss guerin did me the honour to stand as
godmother  and afterwards gave me a treat  i used to attend these
ladies about the town  in which service i was extremely happy  as i
had thus many opportunities of seeing london  which i desired of all
things  i was sometimes  however  with my master at his
rendezvous house  which was at the foot of westminster bridge  here i
used to enjoy myself in playing about the bridge stairs  and often in
the watermen s wherries  with other boys  on one of these occasions
there was another boy with me in a wherry  and we went out into the
current of the river  while we were there two more stout boys came to
us in another wherry  and  abusing us for taking the boat  desired me
to get into the other wherry boat  accordingly i went to get out of
the wherry i was in  but just as i had got one of my feet into the
other boat the boys shoved it off  so that i fell into the thames 
and  not being able to swim  i should unavoidably have been drowned 
but for the assistance of some watermen who providentially came to my
relief 

the namur being again got ready for sea  my master  with his gang  was
ordered on board  and  to my no small grief  i was obliged to leave my
school master  whom i liked very much  and always attended while i
stayed in london  to repair on board with my master  nor did i leave
my kind patronesses  the miss guerins  without uneasiness and regret 
they often used to teach me to read  and took great pains to instruct
me in the principles of religion and the knowledge of god  i therefore
parted from those amiable ladies with reluctance  after receiving from
them many friendly cautions how to conduct myself  and some valuable
presents 

when i came to spithead  i found we were destined for the
mediterranean  with a large fleet  which was now ready to put to sea 
we only waited for the arrival of the admiral  who soon came on board 
and about the beginning of the spring       having weighed anchor  and
got under way  sailed for the mediterranean  and in eleven days  from
the land s end  we got to gibraltar  while we were here i used to be
often on shore  and got various fruits in great plenty  and very
cheap 

i had frequently told several people  in my excursions on shore  the
story of my being kidnapped with my sister  and of our being
separated  as i have related before  and i had as often expressed my
anxiety for her fate  and my sorrow at having never met her again  one
day  when i was on shore  and mentioning these circumstances to some
persons  one of them told me he knew where my sister was  and  if i
would accompany him  he would bring me to her  improbable as this
story was i believed it immediately  and agreed to go with him  while
my heart leaped for joy  and  indeed  he conducted me to a black young
woman  who was so like my sister  that  at first sight  i really
thought it was her  but i was quickly undeceived  and  on talking to
her  i found her to be of another nation 

while we lay here the preston came in from the levant  as soon as she
arrived  my master told me i should now see my old companion  dick 
who had gone in her when she sailed for turkey  i was much rejoiced at
this news  and expected every minute to embrace him  and when the
captain came on board of our ship  which he did immediately after  i
ran to inquire after my friend  but  with inexpressible sorrow  i
learned from the boat s crew that the dear youth was dead  and that
they had brought his chest  and all his other things  to my master 
these he afterwards gave to me  and i regarded them as a memorial of
my friend  whom i loved  and grieved for  as a brother 

while we were at gibraltar  i saw a soldier hanging by his heels  at
one of the moles l   i thought this a strange sight  as i had seen a
man hanged in london by his neck  at another time i saw the master of
a frigate towed to shore on a grating  by several of the men of war s
boats  and discharged the fleet  which i understood was a mark of
disgrace for cowardice  on board the same ship there was also a sailor
hung up at the yard arm 

after lying at gibraltar for some time  we sailed up the mediterranean
a considerable way above the gulf of lyons  where we were one night
overtaken with a terrible gale of wind  much greater than any i had
ever yet experienced  the sea ran so high that  though all the guns
were well housed  there was great reason to fear their getting loose 
the ship rolled so much  and if they had it must have proved our
destruction  after we had cruised here for a short time  we came to
barcelona  a spanish sea port  remarkable for its silk manufactures 
here the ships were all to be watered  and my master  who spoke
different languages  and used often to interpret for the admiral 
superintended the watering of ours  for that purpose he and the
officers of the other ships  who were on the same service  had tents
pitched in the bay  and the spanish soldiers were stationed along the
shore  i suppose to see that no depredations were committed by our
men 

i used constantly to attend my master  and i was charmed with this
place  all the time we stayed it was like a fair with the natives  who
brought us fruits of all kinds  and sold them to us much cheaper than
i got them in england  they used also to bring wine down to us in hog
and sheep skins  which diverted me very much  the spanish officers
here treated our officers with great politeness and attention  and
some of them  in particular  used to come often to my master s tent to
visit him  where they would sometimes divert themselves by mounting me
on the horses or mules  so that i could not fall  and setting them off
at full gallop  my imperfect skill in horsemanship all the while
affording them no small entertainment  after the ships were watered 
we returned to our old station of cruizing off toulon  for the purpose
of intercepting a fleet of french men of war that lay there  one
sunday  in our cruise  we came off a place where there were two small
french frigates lying in shore  and our admiral  thinking to take or
destroy them  sent two ships in after them  the culloden and the
conqueror  they soon came up to the frenchmen  and i saw a smart fight
here  both by sea and land  for the frigates were covered by
batteries  and they played upon our ships most furiously  which they
as furiously returned  and for a long time a constant firing was kept
up on all sides at an amazing rate  at last one frigate sunk  but the
people escaped  though not without much difficulty  and a little after
some of the people left the other frigate also  which was a mere
wreck  however  our ships did not venture to bring her away  they were
so much annoyed from the batteries  which raked them both in going and
coming  their topmasts were shot away  and they were otherwise so much
shattered  that the admiral was obliged to send in many boats to tow
them back to the fleet  i afterwards sailed with a man who fought in
one of the french batteries during the engagement  and he told me our
ships had done considerable mischief that day on shore and in the
batteries 

after this we sailed for gibraltar  and arrived there about august
      here we remained with all our sails unbent  while the fleet was
watering and doing other necessary things  while we were in this
situation  one day the admiral  with most of the principal officers 
and many people of all stations  being on shore  about seven o clock
in the evening we were alarmed by signals from the frigates stationed
for that purpose  and in an instant there was a general cry that the
french fleet was out  and just passing through the streights  the
admiral immediately came on board with some other officers  and it is
impossible to describe the noise  hurry and confusion throughout the
whole fleet  in bending their sails and slipping their cables  many
people and ships  boats were left on shore in the bustle  we had two
captains on board of our ship who came away in the hurry and left
their ships to follow  we shewed lights from the gun whale to the main
topmast head  and all our lieutenants were employed amongst the fleet
to tell the ships not to wait for their captains  but to put the sails
to the yards  slip their cables and follow us  and in this confusion
of making ready for fighting we set out for sea in the dark after the
french fleet  here i could have exclaimed with ajax 

     oh jove  o father  if it be thy will
    that we must perish  we thy will obey 
    but let us perish by the light of day  

they had got the start of us so far that we were not able to come up
with them during the night  but at daylight we saw seven sail of the
line of battle some miles ahead  we immediately chased them till about
four o clock in the evening  when our ships came up with them  and 
though we were about fifteen large ships  our gallant admiral only
fought them with his own division  which consisted of seven  so that
we were just ship for ship  we passed by the whole of the enemy s
fleet in order to come at their commander  mons  la clue  who was in
the ocean  an eighty four gun ship  as we passed they all fired on us 
and at one time three of them fired together  continuing to do so for
some time  notwithstanding which our admiral would not suffer a gun to
be fired at any of them  to my astonishment  but made us lie on our
bellies on the deck till we came quite close to the ocean  who was
ahead of them all  when we had orders to pour the whole three tiers
into her at once 

the engagement now commenced with great fury on both sides  the ocean
immediately returned our fire  and we continued engaged with each
other for some time  during which i was frequently stunned with the
thundering of the great guns  whose dreadful contents hurried many of
my companions into awful eternity  at last the french line was
entirely broken  and we obtained the victory  which was immediately
proclaimed with loud huzzas and acclamations  we took three prizes  la
modeste  of sixty four guns  and le temeraire and centaur  of
seventy four guns each  the rest of the french ships took to flight
with all the sail they could crowd  our ship being very much damaged 
and quite disabled from pursuing the enemy  the admiral immediately
quitted her  and went in the broken and only boat we had left on board
the newark  with which  and some other ships  he went after the
french  the ocean  and another large french ship  called the
redoubtable  endeavouring to escape  ran ashore at cape logas  on the
coast of portugal  and the french admiral and some of the crew got
ashore  but we  finding it impossible to get the ships off  set fire
to them both  about midnight i saw the ocean blow up  with a most
dreadful explosion  i never beheld a more awful scene  in less than a
minute the midnight for a certain space seemed turned into day by the
blaze  which was attended with a noise louder and more terrible than
thunder  that seemed to rend every element around us 

my station during the engagement was on the middle deck  where i was
quartered with another boy  to bring powder to the aftermost gun  and
here i was a witness of the dreadful fate of many of my companions 
who  in the twinkling of an eye  were dashed in pieces  and launched
into eternity  happily i escaped unhurt  though the shot and splinters
flew thick about me during the whole fight  towards the latter part of
it my master was wounded  and i saw him carried down to the surgeon 
but though i was much alarmed for him and wished to assist him i dared
not leave my post  at this station my gun mate  a partner in bringing
powder for the same gun  and i ran a very great risk for more than
half an hour of blowing up the ship  for  when we had taken the
cartridges out of the boxes  the bottoms of many of them proving
rotten  the powder ran all about the deck  near the match tub  we
scarcely had water enough at the last to throw on it  we were also 
from our employment  very much exposed to the enemy s shots  for we
had to go through nearly the whole length of the ship to bring the
powder  i expected therefore every minute to be my last  especially
when i saw our men fall so thick about me  but  wishing to guard as
much against the dangers as possible  at first i thought it would be
safest not to go for the powder till the frenchmen had fired their
broadside  and then  while they were charging  i could go and come
with my powder  but immediately afterwards i thought this caution was
fruitless  and  cheering myself with the reflection that there was a
time allotted for me to die as well as to be born  i instantly cast
off all fear or thought whatever of death  and went through the whole
of my duty with alacrity  pleasing myself with the hope  if i survived
the battle  of relating it and the dangers i had escaped to the dear
miss guerin  and others  when i should return to london 

our ship suffered very much in this engagement  for  besides the
number of our killed and wounded  she was almost torn to pieces  and
our rigging so much shattered  that our mizen mast and main yard   c 
hung over the side of the ship  so that we were obliged to get many
carpenters  and others from some of the ships of the fleet  to assist
in setting us in some tolerable order  and  notwithstanding  it took
us some time before we were completely refitted  after which we left
admiral broderick to command  and we  with the prizes  steered for
england  on the passage  and as soon as my master was something
recovered of his wounds  the admiral appointed him captain of the  tna
fire ship  on which he and i left the namur  and went on board of her
at sea  i liked this little ship very much  i now became the captain s
steward  in which situation i was very happy  for i was extremely well
treated by all on board  and i had leisure to improve myself in
reading and writing  the latter i had learned a little of before i
left the namur  as there was a school on board  when we arrived at
spithead the  tna went into portsmouth harbour to refit  which being
done  we returned to spithead and joined a large fleet that was
thought to be intended against the havannah  but about that time the
king died  whether that prevented the expedition i know not  but it
caused our ship to be stationed at cowes  in the isle of wight  till
the beginning of the year sixty one  here i spent my time very
pleasantly  i was much on shore all about this delightful island  and
found the inhabitants very civil 

while i was here  i met with a trifling incident  which surprised me
agreeably  i was one day in a field belonging to a gentleman who had
a black boy about my own size  this boy having observed me from his
master s house  was transported at the sight of one of his own
countrymen  and ran to meet me with the utmost haste  i not knowing
what he was about turned a little out of his way at first  but to no
purpose  he soon came close to me and caught hold of me in his arms as
if i had been his brother  though we had never seen each other before 
after we had talked together for some time he took me to his master s
house  where i was treated very kindly  this benevolent boy and i were
very happy in frequently seeing each other till about the month of
march       when our ship had orders to fit out again for another
expedition  when we got ready  we joined a very large fleet at
spithead  commanded by commodore keppel  which was destined against
belle isle  and with a number of transport ships with troops on board
to make a descent on the place  we sailed once more in quest of fame 
i longed to engage in new adventures and see fresh wonders 

i had a mind on which every thing uncommon made its full impression 
and every event which i considered as marvellous  every extraordinary
escape  or signal deliverance  either of myself or others  i looked
upon to be effected by the interposition of providence  we had not
been above ten days at sea before an incident of this kind happened 
which  whatever credit it may obtain from the reader  made no small
impression on my mind 

we had on board a gunner  whose name was john mondle  a man of very
indifferent morals  this man s cabin was between the decks  exactly
over where i lay  abreast of the quarter deck ladder  one night  the
  th of april  being terrified with a dream  he awoke in so great a
fright that he could not rest in his bed any longer  nor even remain
in his cabin  and he went upon deck about four o clock in the morning
extremely agitated  he immediately told those on the deck of the
agonies of his mind  and the dream which occasioned it  in which he
said he had seen many things very awful  and had been warned by st 
peter to repent  who told him time was short  this he said had greatly
alarmed him  and he was determined to alter his life  people generally
mock the fears of others when they are themselves in safety  and some
of his shipmates who heard him only laughed at him  however  he made
a vow that he never would drink strong liquors again  and he
immediately got a light  and gave away his sea stores of liquor  after
which  his agitation still continuing  he began to read the
scriptures  hoping to find some relief  and soon afterwards he laid
himself down again on his bed  and endeavoured to compose himself to
sleep  but to no purpose  his mind still continuing in a state of
agony  by this time it was exactly half after seven in the morning  i
was then under the half deck at the great cabin door  and all at once
i heard the people in the waist cry out  most fearfully   the lord
have mercy upon us  we are all lost  the lord have mercy upon us   mr 
mondle hearing the cries  immediately ran out of his cabin  and we
were instantly struck by the lynne  a forty gun ship  captain clark 
which nearly ran us down  this ship had just put about  and was by the
wind  but had not got full headway  or we must all have perished  for
the wind was brisk  however  before mr  mondle had got four steps from
his cabin door  she struck our ship with her cutwater right in the
middle of his bed and cabin  and ran it up to the combings of the
quarter deck hatchway  and above three feet below water  and in a
minute there was not a bit of wood to be seen where mr  mondle s cabin
stood  and he was so near being killed that some of the splinters tore
his face  as mr  mondle must inevitably have perished from this
accident had he not been alarmed in the very extraordinary way i have
related  i could not help regarding this as an awful interposition of
providence for his preservation  the two ships for some time swinged
alongside of each other  for ours being a fire ship  our
grappling irons caught the lynne every way  and the yards and rigging
went at an astonishing rate  our ship was in such a shocking condition
that we all thought she would instantly go down  and every one ran for
their lives  and got as well as they could on board the lynne  but our
lieutenant being the aggressor  he never quitted the ship  however 
when we found she did not sink immediately  the captain came on board
again  and encouraged our people to return and try to save her  many
on this came back  but some would not venture  some of the ships in
the fleet  seeing our situation  immediately sent their boats to our
assistance  but it took us the whole day to save the ship with all
their help  and by using every possible means  particularly frapping
her together with many hawsers  and putting a great quantity of tallow
below water where she was damaged  she was kept together  but it was
well we did not meet with any gales of wind  or we must have gone to
pieces  for we were in such a crazy condition that we had ships to
attend us till we arrived at belle isle  the place of our destination 
and then we had all things taken out of the ship  and she was properly
repaired  this escape of mr  mondle  which he  as well as myself 
always considered as a singular act of providence  i believe had a
great influence on his life and conduct ever afterwards 

now that i am on this subject i beg leave to relate another instance
or two which strongly raised my belief of the particular interposition
of heaven  and which might not otherwise have found a place here  from
their insignificance  i belonged for a few days in the year      to
the jason  of fifty four guns  at plymouth  and one night  when i was
on board  a woman  with a child at her breast  fell from the
upper deck down into the hold  near the keel  every one thought that
the mother and child must be both dashed to pieces  but  to our great
surprise  neither of them was hurt  i myself one day fell headlong
from the upper deck of the  tna down the after hold  when the ballast
was out  and all who saw me fall cried out i was killed  but i
received not the least injury  and in the same ship a man fell from
the mast head on the deck without being hurt  in these  and in many
more instances  i thought i could plainly trace the hand of god 
without whose permission a sparrow cannot fall  i began to raise my
fear from man to him alone  and to call daily on his holy name with
fear and reverence  and i trust he heard my supplications  and
graciously condescended to answer me according to his holy word  and
to implant the seeds of piety in me  even one of the meanest of his
creatures 

when we had refitted our ship  and all things were in readiness for
attacking the place  the troops on board the transports were ordered
to disembark  and my master  as a junior captain  had a share in the
command of the landing  this was on the  th of april  the french were
drawn up on the shore  and had made every disposition to oppose the
landing of our men  only a small part of them this day being able to
effect it  most of them  after fighting with great bravery  were cut
off  and general crawford  with a number of others  were taken
prisoners  in this day s engagement we had also our lieutenant killed 

on the   st of april we renewed our efforts to land the men  while all
the men of war were stationed along the shore to cover it  and fired
at the french batteries and breastworks from early in the morning till
about four o clock in the evening  when our soldiers effected a safe
landing  they immediately attacked the french  and  after a sharp
encounter  forced them from the batteries  before the enemy retreated
they blew up several of them  lest they should fall into our hands 
our men now proceeded to besiege the citadel  and my master was
ordered on shore to superintend the landing of all the materials
necessary for carrying on the siege  in which service i mostly
attended him  while i was there i went about to different parts of the
island  and one day  particularly  my curiosity almost cost me my
life  i wanted very much to see the mode of charging the mortars and
letting off the shells  and for that purpose i went to an english
battery that was but a very few yards from the walls of the citadel 
there  indeed  i had an opportunity of completely gratifying myself in
seeing the whole operation  and that not without running a very great
risk  both from the english shells that burst while i was there  but
likewise from those of the french  one of the largest of their shells
bursted within nine or ten yards of me  there was a single rock close
by  about the size of a butt  and i got instant shelter under it in
time to avoid the fury of the shell  where it burst the earth was torn
in such a manner that two or three butts might easily have gone into
the hole it made  and it threw great quantities of stones and dirt to
a considerable distance  three shot were also fired at me and another
boy who was along with me  one of them in particular seemed

     wing d with red lightning and impetuous rage  

for with a most dreadful sound it hissed close by me  and struck a
rock at a little distance  which it shattered to pieces  when i saw
what perilous circumstances i was in  i attempted to return the
nearest way i could find  and thereby i got between the english and
the french centinels  an english serjeant  who commanded the outposts 
seeing me  and surprised how i came there   which was by stealth along
the seashore   reprimanded me very severely for it  and instantly took
the centinel off his post into custody  for his negligence in
suffering me to pass the lines  while i was in this situation i
observed at a little distance a french horse  belonging to some
islanders  which i thought i would now mount  for the greater
expedition of getting off  accordingly i took some cord which i had
about me  and making a kind of bridle of it  i put it round the
horse s head  and the tame beast very quietly suffered me to tie him
thus and mount him  as soon as i was on the horse s back i began to
kick and beat him  and try every means to make him go quick  but all
to very little purpose  i could not drive him out of a slow pace 
while i was creeping along  still within reach of the enemy s shot  i
met with a servant well mounted on an english horse  i immediately
stopped  and  crying  told him my case  and begged of him to help me 
and this he effectually did  for  having a fine large whip  he began
to lash my horse with it so severely  that he set off full speed with
me towards the sea  while i was quite unable to hold or manage him  in
this manner i went along till i came to a craggy precipice  i now
could not stop my horse  and my mind was filled with apprehensions of
my deplorable fate should he go down the precipice  which he appeared
fully disposed to do  i therefore thought i had better throw myself
off him at once  which i did immediately with a great deal of
dexterity  and fortunately escaped unhurt  as soon as i found myself
at liberty i made the best of my way for the ship  determined i would
not be so fool hardy again in a hurry 

we continued to besiege the citadel till june  when it surrendered 
during the siege i have counted above sixty shells and carcases in the
air at once  when this place was taken i went through the citadel  and
in the bomb proofs under it  which were cut in the solid rock  and i
thought it a surprising place  both for strength and building 
notwithstanding which our shots and shells had made amazing
devastation  and ruinous heaps all around it 

after the taking of this island our ships  with some others commanded
by commodore stanhope in the swiftsure  went to basse road  where we
blocked up a french fleet  our ships were there from june till
february following  and in that time i saw a great many scenes of war 
and stratagems on both sides to destroy each others fleet  sometimes
we would attack the french with some ships of the line  at other times
with boats  and frequently we made prizes  once or twice the french
attacked us by throwing shells with their bomb vessels  and one day as
a french vessel was throwing shells at our ships she broke from her
springs  behind the isle of i de re  the tide being complicated  she
came within a gun shot of the nassau  but the nassau could not bring a
gun to bear upon her  and thereby the frenchman got off  we were twice
attacked by their fire floats  which they chained together  and then
let them float down with the tide  but each time we sent boats with
graplings  and towed them safe out of the fleet 

we had different commanders while we were at this place  commodores
stanhope  dennis  lord howe   c  from hence  before the spanish war
began  our ship and the wasp sloop were sent to st  sebastian in
spain  by commodore stanhope  and commodore dennis afterwards sent our
ship as a cartel to bayonne in france m   after which n  we went in
february in      to belle isle  and there stayed till the summer  when
we left it  and returned to portsmouth 

after our ship was fitted out again for service  in september she went
to guernsey  where i was very glad to see my old hostess  who was now
a widow  and my former little charming companion  her daughter  i
spent some time here very happily with them  till october  when we had
orders to repair to portsmouth  we parted from each other with a great
deal of affection  and i promised to return soon  and see them again 
not knowing what all powerful fate had determined for me  our ship
having arrived at portsmouth  we went into the harbour  and remained
there till the latter end of november  when we heard great talk about
peace  and  to our very great joy  in the beginning of december we had
orders to go up to london with our ship to be paid off  we received
this news with loud huzzas  and every other demonstration of gladness 
and nothing but mirth was to be seen throughout every part of the
ship  i too was not without my share of the general joy on this
occasion  i thought now of nothing but being freed  and working for
myself  and thereby getting money to enable me to get a good
education  for i always had a great desire to be able at least to read
and write  and while i was on shipboard i had endeavoured to improve
myself in both  while i was in the  tna particularly  the captain s
clerk taught me to write  and gave me a smattering of arithmetic as
far as the rule of three  there was also one daniel queen  about forty
years of age  a man very well educated  who messed with me on board
this ship  and he likewise dressed and attended the captain 
fortunately this man soon became very much attached to me  and took
very great pains to instruct me in many things  he taught me to shave
and dress hair a little  and also to read in the bible  explaining
many passages to me  which i did not comprehend  i was wonderfully
surprised to see the laws and rules of my country written almost
exactly here  a circumstance which i believe tended to impress our
manners and customs more deeply on my memory  i used to tell him of
this resemblance  and many a time we have sat up the whole night
together at this employment  in short  he was like a father to me  and
some even used to call me after his name  they also styled me the
black christian  indeed i almost loved him with the affection of a
son  many things i have denied myself that he might have them  and
when i used to play at marbles or any other game  and won a few
half pence  or got any little money  which i sometimes did  for
shaving any one  i used to buy him a little sugar or tobacco  as far
as my stock of money would go  he used to say  that he and i never
should part  and that when our ship was paid off  as i was as free as
himself or any other man on board  he would instruct me in his
business  by which i might gain a good livelihood  this gave me new
life and spirits  and my heart burned within me  while i thought the
time long till i obtained my freedom  for though my master had not
promised it to me  yet  besides the assurances i had received that he
had no right to detain me  he always treated me with the greatest
kindness  and reposed in me an unbounded confidence  he even paid
attention to my morals  and would never suffer me to deceive him  or
tell lies  of which he used to tell me the consequences  and that if i
did so god would not love me  so that  from all this tenderness  i had
never once supposed  in all my dreams of freedom  that he would think
of detaining me any longer than i wished 

in pursuance of our orders we sailed from portsmouth for the thames 
and arrived at deptford the   th of december  where we cast anchor
just as it was high water  the ship was up about half an hour  when my
master ordered the barge to be manned  and all in an instant  without
having before given me the least reason to suspect any thing of the
matter  he forced me into the barge  saying  i was going to leave him 
but he would take care i should not  i was so struck with the
unexpectedness of this proceeding  that for some time i did not make a
reply  only i made an offer to go for my books and chest of clothes 
but he swore i should not move out of his sight  and if i did he would
cut my throat  at the same time taking his hanger  i began  however 
to collect myself  and  plucking up courage  i told him i was free 
and he could not by law serve me so  but this only enraged him the
more  and he continued to swear  and said he would soon let me know
whether he would or not  and at that instant sprung himself into the
barge from the ship  to the astonishment and sorrow of all on board 
the tide  rather unluckily for me  had just turned downward  so that
we quickly fell down the river along with it  till we came among some
outward bound west indiamen  for he was resolved to put me on board
the first vessel he could get to receive me  the boat s crew  who
pulled against their will  became quite faint different times  and
would have gone ashore  but he would not let them  some of them strove
then to cheer me  and told me he could not sell me  and that they
would stand by me  which revived me a little  and i still entertained
hopes  for as they pulled along he asked some vessels to receive me 
but they could not  but  just as we had got a little below gravesend 
we came alongside of a ship which was going away the next tide for the
west indies  her name was the charming sally  captain james doran  and
my master went on board and agreed with him for me  and in a little
time i was sent for into the cabin  when i came there captain doran
asked me if i knew him  i answered that i did not   then   said he
 you are now my slave   i told him my master could not sell me to him 
nor to any one else   why   said he   did not your master buy you   i
confessed he did   but i have served him   said i   many years  and he
has taken all my wages and prize money  for i only got one sixpence
during the war  besides this i have been baptized  and by the laws of
the land no man has a right to sell me   and i added  that i had heard
a lawyer and others at different times tell my master so  they both
then said that those people who told me so were not my friends  but i
replied  it was very extraordinary that other people did not know the
law as well as they  upon this captain doran said i talked too much
english  and if i did not behave myself well  and be quiet  he had a
method on board to make me  i was too well convinced of his power over
me to doubt what he said  and my former sufferings in the slave ship
presenting themselves to my mind  the recollection of them made me
shudder  however  before i retired i told them that as i could not get
any right among men here i hoped i should hereafter in heaven  and i
immediately left the cabin  filled with resentment and sorrow  the
only coat i had with me my master took away with him  and said if my
prize money had been           he had a right to it all  and would have
taken it  i had about nine guineas  which  during my long sea faring
life  i had scraped together from trifling perquisites and little
ventures  and i hid it that instant  lest my master should take that
from me likewise  still hoping that by some means or other i should
make my escape to the shore  and indeed some of my old shipmates told
me not to despair  for they would get me back again  and that  as soon
as they could get their pay  they would immediately come to portsmouth
to me  where this ship was going  but  alas  all my hopes were
baffled  and the hour of my deliverance was yet far off  my master 
having soon concluded his bargain with the captain  came out of the
cabin  and he and his people got into the boat and put off  i followed
them with aching eyes as long as i could  and when they were out of
sight i threw myself on the deck  while my heart was ready to burst
with sorrow and anguish

thus  at the moment i expected all my toils to end  was i plunged  as
i supposed  in a new slavery  in comparison of which all my service
hitherto had been  perfect freedom   and whose horrors  always present
to my mind  now rushed on it with tenfold aggravation  i wept very
bitterly for some time  and began to think that i must have done
something to displease the lord  that he thus punished me so severely 
this filled me with painful reflections on my past conduct  i
recollected that on the morning of our arrival at deptford i had
rashly sworn that as soon as we reached london i would spend the day
in rambling and sport  my conscience smote me for this unguarded
expression  i felt that the lord was able to disappoint me in all
things  and immediately considered my present situation as a judgment
of heaven on account of my presumption in swearing  i therefore  with
contrition of heart  acknowledged my transgression to god  and poured
out my soul before him with unfeigned repentance  and with earnest
supplications i besought him not to abandon me in my distress  nor
cast me from his mercy for ever  in a little time my grief  spent with
its own violence  began to subside  and after the first confusion of
my thoughts was over i reflected with more calmness on my present
condition  i considered that trials and disappointments are sometimes
for our good  and i thought god might perhaps have permitted this in
order to teach me wisdom and resignation  for he had hitherto shadowed
me with the wings of his mercy  and by his invisible but powerful hand
brought me the way i knew not  these reflections gave me a little
comfort  and i rose at last from the deck with dejection and sorrow in
my countenance  yet mixed with some faint hope that the  lord would
appear  for my deliverance 

soon afterwards  as my new master was going ashore  he called me to
him  and told me to behave myself well  and do the business of the
ship the same as any of the rest of the boys  and that i should fare
the better for it  but i made him no answer  i was then asked if i
could swim  and i said  no  however i was made to go under the deck 
and was well watched  the next tide the ship got under way  and soon
after arrived at the mother bank  portsmouth  where she waited a few
days for some of the west india convoy  while i was here i tried every
means i could devise amongst the people of the ship to get me a boat
from the shore  as there was none suffered to come alongside of the
ship  and their own  whenever it was used  was hoisted in again
immediately  a sailor on board took a guinea from me on pretence of
getting me a boat  and promised me  time after time  that it was
hourly to come off  when he had the watch upon deck i watched also 
and looked long enough  but all in vain  i could never see either the
boat or my guinea again  and what i thought was still the worst of
all  the fellow gave information  as i afterwards found  all the while
to the mates  of my intention to go off  if i could in any way do it 
but  rogue like  he never told them he had got a guinea from me to
procure my escape  however  after we had sailed  and his trick was
made known to the ship s crew  i had some satisfaction in seeing him
detested and despised by them all for his behaviour to me  i was still
in hopes that my old shipmates would not forget their promise to come
for me to portsmouth  and  indeed  at last  but not till the day
before we sailed  some of them did come there  and sent me off some
oranges  and other tokens of their regard  they also sent me word they
would come off to me themselves the next day or the day after  and a
lady also  who lived in gosport  wrote to me that she would come and
take me out of the ship at the same time  this lady had been once very
intimate with my former master  i used to sell and take care of a
great deal of property for her  in different ships  and in return she
always shewed great friendship for me  and used to tell my master that
she would take me away to live with her  but  unfortunately for me  a
disagreement soon afterwards took place between them  and she was
succeeded in my master s good graces by another lady  who appeared
sole mistress of the  tna  and mostly lodged on board  i was not so
great a favourite with this lady as with the former  she had conceived
a pique against me on some occasion when she was on board  and she did
not fail to instigate my master to treat me in the manner he did o  

however  the next morning  the   th of december  the wind being brisk
and easterly  the oeolus frigate  which was to escort the convoy 
made a signal for sailing  all the ships then got up their anchors 
and  before any of my friends had an opportunity to come off to my
relief  to my inexpressible anguish our ship had got under way  what
tumultuous emotions agitated my soul when the convoy got under sail 
and i a prisoner on board  now without hope  i kept my swimming eyes
upon the land in a state of unutterable grief  not knowing what to do 
and despairing how to help myself  while my mind was in this situation
the fleet sailed on  and in one day s time i lost sight of the
wished for land  in the first expressions of my grief i reproached my
fate  and wished i had never been born  i was ready to curse the tide
that bore us  the gale that wafted my prison  and even the ship that
conducted us  and i called on death to relieve me from the horrors i
felt and dreaded  that i might be in that place

     where slaves are free  and men oppress no more 
    fool that i was  inur d so long to pain 
    to trust to hope  or dream of joy again 

                                            

    now dragg d once more beyond the western main 
    to groan beneath some dastard planter s chain 
    where my poor countrymen in bondage wait
    the long enfranchisement of ling ring fate 
    hard ling ring fate  while  ere the dawn of day 
    rous d by the lash they go their cheerless way 
    and as their souls with shame and anguish burn 
    salute with groans unwelcome morn s return 
    and  chiding ev ry hour the slow pac d sun 
    pursue their toils till all his race is run 
    no eye to mark their suff rings with a tear

    to stalls as wretched  and as coarse a fare 
    thank heaven one day of mis ry was o er 
    then sink to sleep  and wish to wake no more p   

the turbulence of my emotions however naturally gave way to calmer
thoughts  and i soon perceived what fate had decreed no mortal on
earth could prevent  the convoy sailed on without any accident  with a
pleasant gale and smooth sea  for six weeks  till february  when one
morning the oeolus ran down a brig  one of the convoy  and she
instantly went down and was ingulfed in the dark recesses of the
ocean  the convoy was immediately thrown into great confusion till it
was daylight  and the oeolus was illumined with lights to prevent
any farther mischief  on the   th of february       from the
mast head  we descried our destined island montserrat  and soon after
i beheld those

     regions of sorrow  doleful shades  where peace
    and rest can rarely dwell  hope never comes
    that comes to all  but torture without end
    still urges  

at the sight of this land of bondage  a fresh horror ran through all
my frame  and chilled me to the heart  my former slavery now rose in
dreadful review to my mind  and displayed nothing but misery  stripes 
and chains  and  in the first paroxysm of my grief  i called upon
god s thunder  and his avenging power  to direct the stroke of death
to me  rather than permit me to become a slave  and be sold from lord
to lord 

in this state of my mind our ship came to an anchor  and soon after
discharged her cargo  i now knew what it was to work hard  i was made
to help to unload and load the ship  and  to comfort me in my distress
in that time  two of the sailors robbed me of all my money  and ran
away from the ship  i had been so long used to an european climate
that at first i felt the scorching west india sun very painful  while
the dashing surf would toss the boat and the people in it frequently
above high water mark  sometimes our limbs were broken with this  or
even attended with instant death  and i was day by day mangled and
torn 

about the middle of may  when the ship was got ready to sail for
england  i all the time believing that fate s blackest clouds were
gathering over my head  and expecting their bursting would mix me with
the dead  captain doran sent for me ashore one morning  and i was told
by the messenger that my fate was then determined  with fluttering
steps and trembling heart i came to the captain  and found with him
one mr  robert king  a quaker  and the first merchant in the place 
the captain then told me my former master had sent me there to be
sold  but that he had desired him to get me the best master he could 
as he told him i was a very deserving boy  which captain doran said he
found to be true  and if he were to stay in the west indies he would
be glad to keep me himself  but he could not venture to take me to
london  for he was very sure that when i came there i would leave him 
i at that instant burst out a crying  and begged much of him to take
me to england with him  but all to no purpose  he told me he had got
me the very best master in the whole island  with whom i should be as
happy as if i were in england  and for that reason he chose to let him
have me  though he could sell me to his own brother in law for a great
deal more money than what he got from this gentleman  mr  king  my new
master  then made a reply  and said the reason he had bought me was on
account of my good character  and  as he had not the least doubt of my
good behaviour  i should be very well off with him  he also told me he
did not live in the west indies  but at philadelphia  where he was
going soon  and  as i understood something of the rules of
arithmetic  when we got there he would put me to school  and fit me
for a clerk  this conversation relieved my mind a little  and i left
those gentlemen considerably more at ease in myself than when i came
to them  and i was very grateful to captain doran  and even to my old
master  for the character they had given me  a character which i
afterwards found of infinite service to me  i went on board again  and
took leave of all my shipmates  and the next day the ship sailed  when
she weighed anchor i went to the waterside and looked at her with a
very wishful and aching heart  and followed her with my eyes and tears
until she was totally out of sight  i was so bowed down with grief
that i could not hold up my head for many months  and if my new master
had not been kind to me i believe i should have died under it at last 
and indeed i soon found that he fully deserved the good character
which captain doran had given me of him  for he possessed a most
amiable disposition and temper  and was very charitable and humane  if
any of his slaves behaved amiss he did not beat or use them ill  but
parted with them  this made them afraid of disobliging him  and as he
treated his slaves better than any other man on the island  so he was
better and more faithfully served by them in return  by his kind
treatment i did at last endeavour to compose myself  and with
fortitude  though moneyless  determined to face whatever fate had
decreed for me  mr  king soon asked me what i could do  and at the
same time said he did not mean to treat me as a common slave  i told
him i knew something of seamanship  and could shave and dress hair
pretty well  and i could refine wines  which i had learned on
shipboard  where i had often done it  and that i could write  and
understood arithmetic tolerably well as far as the rule of three  he
then asked me if i knew any thing of gauging  and  on my answering
that i did not  he said one of his clerks should teach me to gauge 

mr  king dealt in all manner of merchandize  and kept from one to six
clerks  he loaded many vessels in a year  particularly to
philadelphia  where he was born  and was connected with a great
mercantile house in that city  he had besides many vessels and
droggers  of different sizes  which used to go about the island  and
others to collect rum  sugar  and other goods  i understood pulling
and managing those boats very well  and this hard work  which was the
first that he set me to  in the sugar seasons used to be my constant
employment  i have rowed the boat  and slaved at the oars  from one
hour to sixteen in the twenty four  during which i had fifteen pence
sterling per day to live on  though sometimes only ten pence  however
this was considerably more than was allowed to other slaves that used
to work with me  and belonged to other gentlemen on the island  those
poor souls had never more than nine pence per day  and seldom more
than six pence  from their masters or owners  though they earned them
three or four pisterines q   for it is a common practice in the west
indies for men to purchase slaves though they have not plantations
themselves  in order to let them out to planters and merchants at so
much a piece by the day  and they give what allowance they chuse out
of this produce of their daily work to their slaves for subsistence 
this allowance is often very scanty  my master often gave the owners
of these slaves two and a half of these pieces per day  and found the
poor fellows in victuals himself  because he thought their owners did
not feed them well enough according to the work they did  the slaves
used to like this very well  and  as they knew my master to be a man
of feeling  they were always glad to work for him in preference to any
other gentleman  some of whom  after they had been paid for these poor
people s labours  would not give them their allowance out of it  many
times have i even seen these unfortunate wretches beaten for asking
for their pay  and often severely flogged by their owners if they did
not bring them their daily or weekly money exactly to the time  though
the poor creatures were obliged to wait on the gentlemen they had
worked for sometimes for more than half the day before they could get
their pay  and this generally on sundays  when they wanted the time
for themselves  in particular  i knew a countryman of mine who once
did not bring the weekly money directly that it was earned  and though
he brought it the same day to his master  yet he was staked to the
ground for this pretended negligence  and was just going to receive a
hundred lashes  but for a gentleman who begged him off fifty  this
poor man was very industrious  and  by his frugality  had saved so
much money by working on shipboard  that he had got a white man to buy
him a boat  unknown to his master  some time after he had this little
estate the governor wanted a boat to bring his sugar from different
parts of the island  and  knowing this to be a negro man s boat  he
seized upon it for himself  and would not pay the owner a farthing 
the man on this went to his master  and complained to him of this act
of the governor  but the only satisfaction he received was to be
damned very heartily by his master  who asked him how dared any of his
negroes to have a boat  if the justly merited ruin of the governor s
fortune could be any gratification to the poor man he had thus robbed 
he was not without consolation  extortion and rapine are poor
providers  and some time after this the governor died in the king s
bench in england  as i was told  in great poverty  the last war
favoured this poor negro man  and he found some means to escape from
his christian master  he came to england  where i saw him afterwards
several times  such treatment as this often drives these miserable
wretches to despair  and they run away from their masters at the
hazard of their lives  many of them  in this place  unable to get
their pay when they have earned it  and fearing to be flogged  as
usual  if they return home without it  run away where they can for
shelter  and a reward is often offered to bring them in dead or alive 
my master used sometimes  in these cases  to agree with their owners 
and to settle with them himself  and thereby he saved many of them a
flogging 

once  for a few days  i was let out to fit a vessel  and i had no
victuals allowed me by either party  at last i told my master of this
treatment  and he took me away from it  in many of the estates  on the
different islands where i used to be sent for rum or sugar  they would
not deliver it to me  or any other negro  he was therefore obliged to
send a white man along with me to those places  and then he used to
pay him from six to ten pisterines a day  from being thus employed 
during the time i served mr  king  in going about the different
estates on the island  i had all the opportunity i could wish for to
see the dreadful usage of the poor men  usage that reconciled me to my
situation  and made me bless god for the hands into which i had
fallen 

i had the good fortune to please my master in every department in
which he employed me  and there was scarcely any part of his business 
or household affairs  in which i was not occasionally engaged  i often
supplied the place of a clerk  in receiving and delivering cargoes to
the ships  in tending stores  and delivering goods  and  besides this 
i used to shave and dress my master when convenient  and take care of
his horse  and when it was necessary  which was very often  i worked
likewise on board of different vessels of his  by these means i became
very useful to my master  and saved him  as he used to acknowledge 
above a hundred pounds a year  nor did he scruple to say i was of more
advantage to him than any of his clerks  though their usual wages in
the west indies are from sixty to a hundred pounds current a year 

i have sometimes heard it asserted that a negro cannot earn his master
the first cost  but nothing can be further from the truth  i suppose
nine tenths of the mechanics throughout the west indies are negro
slaves  and i well know the coopers among them earn two dollars a day 
the carpenters the same  and oftentimes more  as also the masons 
smiths  and fishermen   c  and i have known many slaves whose masters
would not take a thousand pounds current for them  but surely this
assertion refutes itself  for  if it be true  why do the planters and
merchants pay such a price for slaves  and  above all  why do those
who make this assertion exclaim the most loudly against the abolition
of the slave trade  so much are men blinded  and to such inconsistent
arguments are they driven by mistaken interest  i grant  indeed  that
slaves are some times  by half feeding  half clothing  over working
and stripes  reduced so low  that they are turned out as unfit for
service  and left to perish in the woods  or expire on a dunghill 

my master was several times offered by different gentlemen one hundred
guineas for me  but he always told them he would not sell me  to my
great joy  and i used to double my diligence and care for fear of
getting into the hands of those men who did not allow a valuable slave
the common support of life  many of them even used to find fault with
my master for feeding his slaves so well as he did  although i often
went hungry  and an englishman might think my fare very indifferent 
but he used to tell them he always would do it  because the slaves
thereby looked better and did more work 

while i was thus employed by my master i was often a witness to
cruelties of every kind  which were exercised on my unhappy fellow
slaves  i used frequently to have different cargoes of new negroes in
my care for sale  and it was almost a constant practice with our
clerks  and other whites  to commit violent depredations on the
chastity of the female slaves  and these i was  though with
reluctance  obliged to submit to at all times  being unable to help
them  when we have had some of these slaves on board my master s
vessels to carry them to other islands  or to america  i have known
our mates to commit these acts most shamefully  to the disgrace  not
of christians only  but of men  i have even known them gratify their
brutal passion with females not ten years old  and these abominations
some of them practised to such scandalous excess  that one of our
captains discharged the mate and others on that account  and yet in
montserrat i have seen a negro man staked to the ground  and cut most
shockingly  and then his ears cut off bit by bit  because he had been
connected with a white woman who was a common prostitute  as if it
were no crime in the whites to rob an innocent african girl of her
virtue  but most heinous in a black man only to gratify a passion of
nature  where the temptation was offered by one of a different colour 
though the most abandoned woman of her species  another negro man was
half hanged  and then burnt  for attempting to poison a cruel
overseer  thus by repeated cruelties are the wretched first urged to
despair  and then murdered  because they still retain so much of human
nature about them as to wish to put an end to their misery  and
retaliate on their tyrants  these overseers are indeed for the most
part persons of the worst character of any denomination of men in the
west indies  unfortunately  many humane gentlemen  by not residing on
their estates  are obliged to leave the management of them in the
hands of these human butchers  who cut and mangle the slaves in a
shocking manner on the most trifling occasions  and altogether treat
them in every respect like brutes  they pay no regard to the situation
of pregnant women  nor the least attention to the lodging of the
field negroes  their huts  which ought to be well covered  and the
place dry where they take their little repose  are often open sheds 
built in damp places  so that  when the poor creatures return tired
from the toils of the field  they contract many disorders  from being
exposed to the damp air in this uncomfortable state  while they are
heated  and their pores are open  this neglect certainly conspires
with many others to cause a decrease in the births as well as in the
lives of the grown negroes  i can quote many instances of gentlemen
who reside on their estates in the west indies  and then the scene is
quite changed  the negroes are treated with lenity and proper care  by
which their lives are prolonged  and their masters are profited  to
the honour of humanity  i knew several gentlemen who managed their
estates in this manner  and they found that benevolence was their true
interest  and  among many i could mention in several of the islands  i
knew one in montserrat r  whose slaves looked remarkably well  and
never needed any fresh supplies of negroes  and there are many other
estates  especially in barbadoes  which  from such judicious
treatment  need no fresh stock of negroes at any time  i have the
honour of knowing a most worthy and humane gentleman  who is a native
of barbadoes  and has estates there s   this gentleman has written a
treatise on the usage of his own slaves  he allows them two hours for
refreshment at mid day  and many other indulgencies and comforts 
particularly in their lying  and  besides this  he raises more
provisions on his estate than they can destroy  so that by these
attentions he saves the lives of his negroes  and keeps them healthy 
and as happy as the condition of slavery can admit  i myself  as shall
appear in the sequel  managed an estate  where  by those attentions 
the negroes were uncommonly cheerful and healthy  and did more work by
half than by the common mode of treatment they usually do  for want 
therefore  of such care and attention to the poor negroes  and
otherwise oppressed as they are  it is no wonder that the decrease
should require        new negroes annually to fill up the vacant
places of the dead 

even in barbadoes  notwithstanding those humane exceptions which i
have mentioned  and others i am acquainted with  which justly make it
quoted as a place where slaves meet with the best treatment  and need
fewest recruits of any in the west indies  yet this island requires
     negroes annually to keep up the original stock  which is only
        so that the whole term of a negro s life may be said to be
there but sixteen years  t  and yet the climate here is in every
respect the same as that from which they are taken  except in being
more wholesome  do the british colonies decrease in this manner  and
yet what a prodigious difference is there between an english and west
india climate 

while i was in montserrat i knew a negro man  named emanuel sankey 
who endeavoured to escape from his miserable bondage  by concealing
himself on board of a london ship  but fate did not favour the poor
oppressed man  for  being discovered when the vessel was under sail 
he was delivered up again to his master  this christian master
immediately pinned the wretch down to the ground at each wrist and
ancle  and then took some sticks of sealing wax  and lighted them  and
droped it all over his back  there was another master who was noted
for cruelty  and i believe he had not a slave but what had been cut 
and had pieces fairly taken out of the flesh  and  after they had been
punished thus  he used to make them get into a long wooden box or case
he had for that purpose  in which he shut them up during pleasure  it
was just about the height and breadth of a man  and the poor wretches
had no room  when in the case  to move 

it was very common in several of the islands  particularly in st 
kitt s  for the slaves to be branded with the initial letters of their
master s name  and a load of heavy iron hooks hung about their necks 
indeed on the most trifling occasions they were loaded with chains 
and often instruments of torture were added  the iron muzzle 
thumb screws   c  are so well known  as not to need a description  and
were sometimes applied for the slightest faults  i have seen a negro
beaten till some of his bones were broken  for even letting a pot boil
over  is it surprising that usage like this should drive the poor
creatures to despair  and make them seek a refuge in death from those
evils which render their lives intolerable  while 

     with shudd ring horror pale  and eyes aghast 
    they view their lamentable lot  and find
    no rest  

this they frequently do  a negro man on board a vessel of my master 
while i belonged to her  having been put in irons for some trifling
misdemeanor  and kept in that state for some days  being weary of
life  took an opportunity of jumping overboard into the sea  however 
he was picked up without being drowned  another  whose life was also a
burden to him  resolved to starve himself to death  and refused to eat
any victuals  this procured him a severe flogging  and he also  on the
first occasion which offered  jumped overboard at charles town  but
was saved 

nor is there any greater regard shewn to the little property than
there is to the persons and lives of the negroes  i have already
related an instance or two of particular oppression out of many which
i have witnessed  but the following is frequent in all the islands 
the wretched field slaves  after toiling all the day for an unfeeling
owner  who gives them but little victuals  steal sometimes a few
moments from rest or refreshment to gather some small portion of
grass  according as their time will admit  this they commonly tie up
in a parcel   either a bit  worth six pence  or half a bit s worth 
and bring it to town  or to the market  to sell  nothing is more
common than for the white people on this occasion to take the grass
from them without paying for it  and not only so  but too often also 
to my knowledge  our clerks  and many others  at the same time have
committed acts of violence on the poor  wretched  and helpless
females  whom i have seen for hours stand crying to no purpose  and
get no redress or pay of any kind  is not this one common and crying
sin enough to bring down god s judgment on the islands  he tells us
the oppressor and the oppressed are both in his hands  and if these
are not the poor  the broken hearted  the blind  the captive  the
bruised  which our saviour speaks of  who are they  one of these
depredators once  in st  eustatia  came on board of our vessel  and
bought some fowls and pigs of me  and a whole day after his departure
with the things he returned again and wanted his money back  i refused
to give it  and  not seeing my captain on board  he began the common
pranks with me  and swore he would even break open my chest and take
my money  i therefore expected  as my captain was absent  that he
would be as good as his word  and he was just proceeding to strike me 
when fortunately a british seaman on board  whose heart had not been
debauched by a west india climate  interposed and prevented him  but
had the cruel man struck me i certainly should have defended myself at
the hazard of my life  for what is life to a man thus oppressed  he
went away  however  swearing  and threatened that whenever he caught
me on shore he would shoot me  and pay for me afterwards 

the small account in which the life of a negro is held in the west
indies is so universally known  that it might seem impertinent to
quote the following extract  if some people had not been hardy enough
of late to assert that negroes are on the same footing in that respect
as europeans  by the    th act  page      of the assembly of
barbadoes  it is enacted  that if any negro  or other slave  under
punishment by his master  or his order  for running away  or any other
crime or misdemeanor towards his said master  unfortunately shall
suffer in life or member  no person whatsoever shall be liable to a
fine  but if any man shall out of  wantonness  or only of
bloody mindedness  or cruel intention  wilfully kill a negro  or other
slave  of his own  he shall pay into the public treasury fifteen
pounds sterling    and it is the same in most  if not all  of the west
india islands  is not this one of the many acts of the islands which
call loudly for redress  and do not the assembly which enacted it
deserve the appellation of savages and brutes rather than of
christians and men  it is an act at once unmerciful  unjust  and
unwise  which for cruelty would disgrace an assembly of those who are
called barbarians  and for its injustice and  insanity  would shock
the morality and common sense of a samaide or a hottentot 

shocking as this and many more acts of the bloody west india code at
first view appear  how is the iniquity of it heightened when we
consider to whom it may be extended  mr  james tobin  a zealous
labourer in the vineyard of slavery  gives an account of a french
planter of his acquaintance  in the island of martinico  who shewed
him many mulattoes working in the fields like beasts of burden  and he
told mr  tobin these were all the produce of his own loins  and i
myself have known similar instances  pray  reader  are these sons and
daughters of the french planter less his children by being begotten on
a black woman  and what must be the virtue of those legislators  and
the feelings of those fathers  who estimate the lives of their sons 
however begotten  at no more than fifteen pounds  though they should
be murdered  as the act says   out of wantonness and bloody mindedness  
but is not the slave trade entirely a war with the heart of man  and
surely that which is begun by breaking down the barriers of virtue
involves in its continuance destruction to every principle  and buries
all sentiments in ruin 

i have often seen slaves  particularly those who were meagre  in
different islands  put into scales and weighed  and then sold from
three pence to six pence or nine pence a pound  my master  however 
whose humanity was shocked at this mode  used to sell such by the
lump  and at or after a sale it was not uncommon to see negroes taken
from their wives  wives taken from their husbands  and children from
their parents  and sent off to other islands  and wherever else their
merciless lords chose  and probably never more during life to see each
other  oftentimes my heart has bled at these partings  when the
friends of the departed have been at the water side  and  with sighs
and tears  have kept their eyes fixed on the vessel till it went out
of sight 

a poor creole negro i knew well  who  after having been often thus
transported from island to island  at last resided in montserrat  this
man used to tell me many melancholy tales of himself  generally  after
he had done working for his master  he used to employ his few leisure
moments to go a fishing  when he had caught any fish  his master would
frequently take them from him without paying him  and at other times
some other white people would serve him in the same manner  one day he
said to me  very movingly   sometimes when a white man take away my
fish i go to my maser  and he get me my right  and when my maser by
strength take away my fishes  what me must do  i can t go to any body
to be righted  then  said the poor man  looking up above  i must look
up to god mighty in the top for right   this artless tale moved me
much  and i could not help feeling the just cause moses had in
redressing his brother against the egyptian  i exhorted the man to
look up still to the god on the top  since there was no redress below 
though i little thought then that i myself should more than once
experience such imposition  and read the same exhortation hereafter 
in my own transactions in the islands  and that even this poor man and
i should some time after suffer together in the same manner  as shall
be related hereafter 

nor was such usage as this confined to particular places or
individuals  for  in all the different islands in which i have been
 and i have visited no less than fifteen  the treatment of the slaves
was nearly the same  so nearly indeed  that the history of an island 
or even a plantation  with a few such exceptions as i have mentioned 
might serve for a history of the whole  such a tendency has the
slave trade to debauch men s minds  and harden them to every feeling
of humanity  for i will not suppose that the dealers in slaves are
born worse than other men  no  it is the fatality of this mistaken
avarice  that it corrupts the milk of human kindness and turns it into
gall  and  had the pursuits of those men been different  they might
have been as generous  as tender hearted and just  as they are
unfeeling  rapacious and cruel  surely this traffic cannot be good 
which spreads like a pestilence  and taints what it touches  which
violates that first natural right of mankind  equality and
independency  and gives one man a dominion over his fellows which god
could never intend  for it raises the owner to a state as far above
man as it depresses the slave below it  and  with all the presumption
of human pride  sets a distinction between them  immeasurable in
extent  and endless in duration  yet how mistaken is the avarice even
of the planters  are slaves more useful by being thus humbled to the
condition of brutes  than they would be if suffered to enjoy the
privileges of men  the freedom which diffuses health and prosperity
throughout britain answers you  no  when you make men slaves you
deprive them of half their virtue  you set them in your own conduct an
example of fraud  rapine  and cruelty  and compel them to live with
you in a state of war  and yet you complain that they are not honest
or faithful  you stupify them with stripes  and think it necessary to
keep them in a state of ignorance  and yet you assert that they are
incapable of learning  that their minds are such a barren soil or
moor  that culture would be lost on them  and that they come from a
climate  where nature  though prodigal of her bounties in a degree
unknown to yourselves  has left man alone scant and unfinished  and
incapable of enjoying the treasures she has poured out for him   an
assertion at once impious and absurd  why do you use those instruments
of torture  are they fit to be applied by one rational being to
another  and are ye not struck with shame and mortification  to see
the partakers of your nature reduced so low  but  above all  are there
no dangers attending this mode of treatment  are you not hourly in
dread of an insurrection  nor would it be surprising  for when

       no peace is given
    to us enslav d  but custody severe 
    and stripes and arbitrary punishment
    inflicted  what peace can we return 
    but to our power  hostility and hate 
    untam d reluctance  and revenge  though slow 
    yet ever plotting how the conqueror least
    may reap his conquest  and may least rejoice
    in doing what we most in suffering feel  

but by changing your conduct  and treating your slaves as men  every
cause of fear would be banished  they would be faithful  honest 
intelligent and vigorous  and peace  prosperity  and happiness  would
attend you

in the preceding chapter i have set before the reader a few of those
many instances of oppression  extortion  and cruelty  which i have
been a witness to in the west indies  but  were i to enumerate them
all  the catalogue would be tedious and disgusting  the punishments of
the slaves on every trifling occasion are so frequent  and so well
known  together with the different instruments with which they are
tortured  that it cannot any longer afford novelty to recite them  and
they are too shocking to yield delight either to the writer or the
reader  i shall therefore hereafter only mention such as incidentally
befel myself in the course of my adventures 

in the variety of departments in which i was employed by my master  i
had an opportunity of seeing many curious scenes in different islands 
but  above all  i was struck with a celebrated curiosity called
brimstone hill  which is a high and steep mountain  some few miles
from the town of plymouth in montserrat  i had often heard of some
wonders that were to be seen on this hill  and i went once with some
white and black people to visit it  when we arrived at the top  i saw
under different cliffs great flakes of brimstone  occasioned by the
steams of various little ponds  which were then boiling naturally in
the earth  some of these ponds were as white as milk  some quite blue 
and many others of different colours  i had taken some potatoes with
me  and i put them into different ponds  and in a few minutes they
were well boiled  i tasted some of them  but they were very
sulphurous  and the silver shoe buckles  and all the other things of
that metal we had among us  were  in a little time  turned as black
as lead 

some time in the year      kind providence seemed to appear rather
more favourable to me  one of my master s vessels  a bermudas sloop 
about sixty tons  was commanded by one captain thomas farmer  an
englishman  a very alert and active man  who gained my master a great
deal of money by his good management in carrying passengers from one
island to another  but very often his sailors used to get drunk and
run away from the vessel  which hindered him in his business very
much  this man had taken a liking to me  and many different times
begged of my master to let me go a trip with him as a sailor  but he
would tell him he could not spare me  though the vessel sometimes
could not go for want of hands  for sailors were generally very scarce
in the island  however  at last  from necessity or force  my master
was prevailed on  though very reluctantly  to let me go with this
captain  but he gave great charge to him to take care that i did not
run away  for if i did he would make him pay for me  this being the
case  the captain had for some time a sharp eye upon me whenever the
vessel anchored  and as soon as she returned i was sent for on shore
again  thus was i slaving as it were for life  sometimes at one thing 
and sometimes at another  so that the captain and i were nearly the
most useful men in my master s employment  i also became so useful to
the captain on shipboard  that many times  when he used to ask for me
to go with him  though it should be but for twenty four hours  to some
of the islands near us  my master would answer he could not spare me 
at which the captain would swear  and would not go the trip  and tell
my master i was better to him on board than any three white men he
had  for they used to behave ill in many respects  particularly in
getting drunk  and then they frequently got the boat stove  so as to
hinder the vessel from coming back as soon as she might have done 
this my master knew very well  and at last  by the captain s constant
entreaties  after i had been several times with him  one day  to my
great joy  my master told me the captain would not let him rest  and
asked me whether i would go aboard as a sailor  or stay on shore and
mind the stores  for he could not bear any longer to be plagued in
this manner  i was very happy at this proposal  for i immediately
thought i might in time stand some chance by being on board to get a
little money  or possibly make my escape if i should be used ill  i
also expected to get better food  and in greater abundance  for i had
felt much hunger oftentimes  though my master treated his slaves  as i
have observed  uncommonly well  i therefore  without hesitation 
answered him  that i would go and be a sailor if he pleased 
accordingly i was ordered on board directly  nevertheless  between the
vessel and the shore  when she was in port  i had little or no rest 
as my master always wished to have me along with him  indeed he was a
very pleasant gentleman  and but for my expectations on shipboard i
should not have thought of leaving him  but the captain liked me also
very much  and i was entirely his right hand man  i did all i could to
deserve his favour  and in return i received better treatment from him
than any other i believe ever met with in the west indies in my
situation 

after i had been sailing for some time with this captain  at length i
endeavoured to try my luck and commence merchant  i had but a very
small capital to begin with  for one single half bit  which is equal
to three pence in england  made up my whole stock  however i trusted
to the lord to be with me  and at one of our trips to st  eustatia  a
dutch island  i bought a glass tumbler with my half bit  and when i
came to montserrat i sold it for a bit  or sixpence  luckily we made
several successive trips to st  eustatia  which was a general mart for
the west indies  about twenty leagues from montserrat   and in our
next  finding my tumbler so profitable  with this one bit i bought two
tumblers more  and when i came back i sold them for two bits  equal to
a shilling sterling  when we went again i bought with these two bits
four more of these glasses  which i sold for four bits on our return
to montserrat  and in our next voyage to st  eustatia i bought two
glasses with one bit  and with the other three i bought a jug of
geneva  nearly about three pints in measure  when we came to
montserrat i sold the gin for eight bits  and the tumblers for two  so
that my capital now amounted in all to a dollar  well husbanded and
acquired in the space of a month or six weeks  when i blessed the lord
that i was so rich  as we sailed to different islands  i laid this
money out in various things occasionally  and it used to turn out to
very good account  especially when we went to guadaloupe  grenada  and
the rest of the french islands  thus was i going all about the islands
upwards of four years  and ever trading as i went  during which i
experienced many instances of ill usage  and have seen many injuries
done to other negroes in our dealings with europeans  and  amidst our
recreations  when we have been dancing and merry making  they  without
cause  have molested and insulted us  indeed i was more than once
obliged to look up to god on high  as i had advised the poor fisherman
some time before  and i had not been long trading for myself in the
manner i have related above  when i experienced the like trial in
company with him as follows  this man being used to the water  was
upon an emergency put on board of us by his master to work as another
hand  on a voyage to santa cruz  and at our sailing he had brought his
little all for a venture  which consisted of six bits  worth of limes
and oranges in a bag  i had also my whole stock  which was about
twelve bits  worth of the same kind of goods  separate in two bags 
for we had heard these fruits sold well in that island  when we came
there  in some little convenient time he and i went ashore with our
fruits to sell them  but we had scarcely landed when we were met by
two white men  who presently took our three bags from us  we could not
at first guess what they meant to do  and for some time we thought
they were jesting with us  but they too soon let us know otherwise 
for they took our ventures immediately to a house hard by  and
adjoining the fort  while we followed all the way begging of them to
give us our fruits  but in vain  they not only refused to return them 
but swore at us  and threatened if we did not immediately depart they
would flog us well  we told them these three bags were all we were
worth in the world  and that we brought them with us to sell when we
came from montserrat  and shewed them the vessel  but this was rather
against us  as they now saw we were strangers as well as slaves  they
still therefore swore  and desired us to be gone  and even took sticks
to beat us  while we  seeing they meant what they said  went off in
the greatest confusion and despair  thus  in the very minute of
gaining more by three times than i ever did by any venture in my life
before  was i deprived of every farthing i was worth  an
insupportable misfortune  but how to help ourselves we knew not  in
our consternation we went to the commanding officer of the fort and
told him how we had been served by some of his people  but we obtained
not the least redress  he answered our complaints only by a volley of
imprecations against us  and immediately took a horse whip  in order
to chastise us  so that we were obliged to turn out much faster than
we came in  i now  in the agony of distress and indignation  wished
that the ire of god in his forked lightning might transfix these cruel
oppressors among the dead  still however we persevered  went back
again to the house  and begged and besought them again and again for
our fruits  till at last some other people that were in the house
asked if we would be contented if they kept one bag and gave us the
other two  we  seeing no remedy whatever  consented to this  and they 
observing one bag to have both kinds of fruit in it  which belonged to
my companion  kept that  and the other two  which were mine  they gave
us back  as soon as i got them  i ran as fast as i could  and got the
first negro man i could to help me off  my companion  however  stayed
a little longer to plead  he told them the bag they had was his  and
likewise all that he was worth in the world  but this was of no avail 
and he was obliged to return without it  the poor old man  wringing
his hands  cried bitterly for his loss  and  indeed  he then did look
up to god on high  which so moved me with pity for him  that i gave
him nearly one third of my fruits  we then proceeded to the markets to
sell them  and providence was more favourable to us than we could have
expected  for we sold our fruits uncommonly well  i got for mine about
thirty seven bits  such a surprising reverse of fortune in so short a
space of time seemed like a dream to me  and proved no small
encouragement for me to trust the lord in any situation  my captain
afterwards frequently used to take my part  and get me my right  when
i have been plundered or used ill by these tender christian
depredators  among whom i have shuddered to observe the unceasing
blasphemous execrations which are wantonly thrown out by persons of
all ages and conditions  not only without occasion  but even as if
they were indulgences and pleasure 

at one of our trips to st  kitt s i had eleven bits of my own  and my
friendly captain lent me five bits more  with which i bought a bible 
i was very glad to get this book  which i scarcely could meet with any
where  i think there was none sold in montserrat  and  much to my
grief  from being forced out of the  tna in the manner i have related 
my bible  and the guide to the indians  the two books i loved above
all others  were left behind 

while i was in this place  st  kitt s  a very curious imposition on
human nature took place   a white man wanted to marry in the church a
free black woman that had land and slaves in montserrat  but the
clergyman told him it was against the law of the place to marry a
white and a black in the church  the man then asked to be married on
the water  to which the parson consented  and the two lovers went in
one boat  and the parson and clerk in another  and thus the ceremony
was performed  after this the loving pair came on board our vessel 
and my captain treated them extremely well  and brought them safe to
montserrat 

the reader cannot but judge of the irksomeness of this situation to a
mind like mine  in being daily exposed to new hardships and
impositions  after having seen many better days  and having been as it
were in a state of freedom and plenty  added to which  every part of
the world i had hitherto been in seemed to me a paradise in comparison
of the west indies  my mind was therefore hourly replete with
inventions and thoughts of being freed  and  if possible  by honest
and honourable means  for i always remembered the old adage  and i
trust it has ever been my ruling principle  that honesty is the best
policy  and likewise that other golden precept  to do unto all men as
i would they should do unto me  however  as i was from early years a
predestinarian  i thought whatever fate had determined must ever come
to pass  and therefore  if ever it were my lot to be freed nothing
could prevent me  although i should at present see no means or hope to
obtain my freedom  on the other hand  if it were my fate not to be
freed i never should be so  and all my endeavours for that purpose
would be fruitless  in the midst of these thoughts i therefore looked
up with prayers anxiously to god for my liberty  and at the same time
i used every honest means  and endeavoured all that was possible on
my part to obtain it  in process of time i became master of a few
pounds  and in a fair way of making more  which my friendly captain
knew very well  this occasioned him sometimes to take liberties with
me  but whenever he treated me waspishly i used plainly to tell him my
mind  and that i would die before i would be imposed on as other
negroes were  and that to me life had lost its relish when liberty was
gone  this i said although i foresaw my then well being or future
hopes of freedom  humanly speaking  depended on this man  however  as
he could not bear the thoughts of my not sailing with him  he always
became mild on my threats  i therefore continued with him  and  from
my great attention to his orders and his business  i gained him
credit  and through his kindness to me i at last procured my liberty 
while i thus went on  filled with the thoughts of freedom  and
resisting oppression as well as i was able  my life hung daily in
suspense  particularly in the surfs i have formerly mentioned  as i
could not swim  these are extremely violent throughout the west
indies  and i was ever exposed to their howling rage and devouring
fury in all the islands  i have seen them strike and toss a boat right
up an end  and maim several on board  once in the grenada islands 
when i and about eight others were pulling a large boat with two
puncheons of water in it  a surf struck us  and drove the boat and all
in it about half a stone s throw  among some trees  and above the high
water mark  we were obliged to get all the assistance we could from
the nearest estate to mend the boat  and launch it into the water
again  at montserrat one night  in pressing hard to get off the shore
on board  the punt was overset with us four times  the first time i
was very near being drowned  however the jacket i had on kept me up
above water a little space of time  while i called on a man near me
who was a good swimmer  and told him i could not swim  he then made
haste to me  and  just as i was sinking  he caught hold of me  and
brought me to sounding  and then he went and brought the punt also  as
soon as we had turned the water out of her  lest we should be used ill
for being absent  we attempted again three times more  and as often
the horrid surfs served us as at first  but at last  the fifth time we
attempted  we gained our point  at the imminent hazard of our lives 
one day also  at old road in montserrat  our captain  and three men
besides myself  were going in a large canoe in quest of rum and sugar 
when a single surf tossed the canoe an amazing distance from the
water  and some of us even a stone s throw from each other  most of us
were very much bruised  so that i and many more often said  and really
thought  that there was not such another place under the heavens as
this  i longed therefore much to leave it  and daily wished to see my
master s promise performed of going to philadelphia  while we lay in
this place a very cruel thing happened on board of our sloop which
filled me with horror  though i found afterwards such practices were
frequent  there was a very clever and decent free young mulatto man
who sailed a long time with us  he had a free woman for his wife  by
whom he had a child  and she was then living on shore  and all very
happy  our captain and mate  and other people on board  and several
elsewhere  even the natives of bermudas  all knew this young man from
a child that he was always free  and no one had ever claimed him as
their property  however  as might too often overcomes right in these
parts  it happened that a bermudas captain  whose vessel lay there for
a few days in the road  came on board of us  and seeing the
mulatto man  whose name was joseph clipson  he told him he was not
free  and that he had orders from his master to bring him to bermudas 
the poor man could not believe the captain to be in earnest  but he
was very soon undeceived  his men laying violent hands on him  and
although he shewed a certificate of his being born free in st  kitt s 
and most people on board knew that he served his time to boat
building  and always passed for a free man  yet he was taken forcibly
out of our vessel  he then asked to be carried ashore before the
secretary or magistrates  and these infernal invaders of human rights
promised him he should  but  instead of that  they carried him on
board of the other vessel  and the next day  without giving the poor
man any hearing on shore  or suffering him even to see his wife or
child  he was carried away  and probably doomed never more in this
world to see them again  nor was this the only instance of this kind
of barbarity i was a witness to  i have since often seen in jamaica
and other islands free men  whom i have known in america  thus
villainously trepanned and held in bondage  i have heard of two
similar practices even in philadelphia  and were it not for the
benevolence of the quakers in that city many of the sable race  who
now breathe the air of liberty  would  i believe  be groaning indeed
under some planter s chains  these things opened my mind to a new
scene of horror to which i had been before a stranger  hitherto i had
thought only slavery dreadful  but the state of a free negro appeared
to me now equally so at least  and in some respects even worse  for
they live in constant alarm for their liberty  and even this is but
nominal  for they are universally insulted and plundered without the
possibility of redress  for such is the equity of the west indian
laws  that no free negro s evidence will be admitted in their courts
of justice  in this situation is it surprising that slaves  when
mildly treated  should prefer even the misery of slavery to such a
mockery of freedom  i was now completely disgusted with the west
indies  and thought i never should be entirely free until i had left
them 

     with thoughts like these my anxious boding mind
    recall d those pleasing scenes i left behind 
    scenes where fair liberty in bright array
    makes darkness bright  and e en illumines day 
    where nor complexion  wealth  or station  can
    protect the wretch who makes a slave of man  

i determined to make every exertion to obtain my freedom  and to
return to old england  for this purpose i thought a knowledge of
navigation might be of use to me  for  though i did not intend to run
away unless i should be ill used  yet  in such a case  if i understood
navigation  i might attempt my escape in our sloop  which was one of
the swiftest sailing vessels in the west indies  and i could be at no
loss for hands to join me  and if i should make this attempt  i had
intended to have gone for england  but this  as i said  was only to be
in the event of my meeting with any ill usage  i therefore employed
the mate of our vessel to teach me navigation  for which i agreed to
give him twenty four dollars  and actually paid him part of the money
down  though when the captain  some time after  came to know that the
mate was to have such a sum for teaching me  he rebuked him  and said
it was a shame for him to take any money from me  however  my
progress in this useful art was much retarded by the constancy of our
work  had i wished to run away i did not want opportunities  which
frequently presented themselves  and particularly at one time  soon
after this  when we were at the island of gaurdeloupe there was a
large fleet of merchantmen bound for old france  and  seamen then
being very scarce  they gave from fifteen to twenty pounds a man for
the run  our mate  and all the white sailors  left our vessel on this
account  and went on board of the french ships  they would have had me
also to go with them  for they regarded me  and they swore to protect
me  if i would go  and  as the fleet was to sail the next day  i
really believe i could have got safe to europe at that time  however 
as my master was kind  i would not attempt to leave him  and 
remembering the old maxim  that  honesty is the best policy   i
suffered them to go without me  indeed my captain was much afraid of
my leaving him and the vessel at that time  as i had so fair an
opportunity  but  i thank god  this fidelity of mine turned out much
to my advantage hereafter  when i did not in the least think of it 
and made me so much in favour with the captain  that he used now and
then to teach me some parts of navigation himself  but some of our
passengers  and others  seeing this  found much fault with him for it 
saying it was a very dangerous thing to let a negro know navigation 
thus i was hindered again in my pursuits  about the latter end of the
year      my master bought a larger sloop  called the providence 
about seventy or eighty tons  of which my captain had the command  i
went with him into this vessel  and we took a load of new slaves for
georgia and charles town  my master now left me entirely to the
captain  though he still wished for me to be with him  but i  who
always much wished to lose sight of the west indies  was not a little
rejoiced at the thoughts of seeing any other country  therefore 
relying on the goodness of my captain  i got ready all the little
venture i could  and  when the vessel was ready  we sailed  to my
great joy  when we got to our destined places  georgia and charles
town  i expected i should have an opportunity of selling my little
property to advantage  but here  particularly in charles town  i met
with buyers  white men  who imposed on me as in other places 
notwithstanding  i was resolved to have fortitude  thinking no lot or
trial is too hard when kind heaven is the rewarder  we soon got loaded
again  and returned to montserrat  and there  amongst the rest of the
islands  i sold my goods well  and in this manner i continued trading
during the year       meeting with various scenes of imposition  as
usual  after this  my master fitted out his vessel for philadelphia 
in the year       and during the time we were loading her  and getting
ready for the voyage  i worked with redoubled alacrity  from the hope
of getting money enough by these voyages to buy my freedom in time  if
it should please god  and also to see the town of philadelphia  which
i had heard a great deal about for some years past  besides which  i
had always longed to prove my master s promise the first day i came to
him  in the midst of these elevated ideas  and while i was about
getting my little merchandize in readiness  one sunday my master sent
for me to his house  when i came there i found him and the captain
together  and  on my going in  i was struck with astonishment at his
telling me he heard that i meant to run away from him when i got to
philadelphia   and therefore   said he   i must sell you again  you
cost me a great deal of money  no less than forty pounds sterling  and
it will not do to lose so much  you are a valuable fellow   continued
he   and i can get any day for you one hundred guineas  from many
gentlemen in this island   and then he told me of captain doran s
brother in law  a severe master  who ever wanted to buy me to make me
his overseer  my captain also said he could get much more than a
hundred guineas for me in carolina  this i knew to be a fact  for the
gentleman that wanted to buy me came off several times on board of us 
and spoke to me to live with him  and said he would use me well  when
i asked what work he would put me to he said  as i was a sailor  he
would make me a captain of one of his rice vessels  but i refused  and
fearing  at the same time  by a sudden turn i saw in the captain s
temper  he might mean to sell me  i told the gentleman i would not
live with him on any condition  and that i certainly would run away
with his vessel  but he said he did not fear that  as he would catch
me again  and then he told me how cruelly he would serve me if i
should do so  my captain  however  gave him to understand that i knew
something of navigation  so he thought better of it  and  to my great
joy  he went away  i now told my master i did not say i would run away
in philadelphia  neither did i mean it  as he did not use me ill  nor
yet the captain  for if they did i certainly would have made some
attempts before now  but as i thought that if it were god s will i
ever should be freed it would be so  and  on the contrary  if it was
not his will it would not happen  so i hoped  if ever i were freed 
whilst i was used well  it should be by honest means  but  as i could
not help myself  he must do as he pleased  i could only hope and trust
to the god of heaven  and at that instant my mind was big with
inventions and full of schemes to escape  i then appealed to the
captain whether he ever saw any sign of my making the least attempt to
run away  and asked him if i did not always come on board according to
the time for which he gave me liberty  and  more particularly  when
all our men left us at gaurdeloupe and went on board of the french
fleet  and advised me to go with them  whether i might not  and that
he could not have got me again  to my no small surprise  and very
great joy  the captain confirmed every syllable that i had said  and
even more  for he said he had tried different times to see if i would
make any attempt of this kind  both at st  eustatia and in america 
and he never found that i made the smallest  but  on the contrary  i
always came on board according to his orders  and he did really
believe  if i ever meant to run away  that  as i could never have had
a better opportunity  i would have done it the night the mate and all
the people left our vessel at gaurdeloupe  the captain then informed
my master  who had been thus imposed on by our mate  though i did not
know who was my enemy  the reason the mate had for imposing this lie
upon him  which was  because i had acquainted the captain of the
provisions the mate had given away or taken out of the vessel  this
speech of the captain was like life to the dead to me  and instantly
my soul glorified god  and still more so on hearing my master
immediately say that i was a sensible fellow  and he never did intend
to use me as a common slave  and that but for the entreaties of the
captain  and his character of me  he would not have let me go from the
stores about as i had done  that also  in so doing  he thought by
carrying one little thing or other to different places to sell i might
make money  that he also intended to encourage me in this by crediting
me with half a puncheon of rum and half a hogshead of sugar at a time 
so that  from being careful  i might have money enough  in some time 
to purchase my freedom  and  when that was the case  i might depend
upon it he would let me have it for forty pounds sterling money  which
was only the same price he gave for me  this sound gladdened my poor
heart beyond measure  though indeed it was no more than the very idea
i had formed in my mind of my master long before  and i immediately
made him this reply   sir  i always had that very thought of you 
indeed i had  and that made me so diligent in serving you   he then
gave me a large piece of silver coin  such as i never had seen or had
before  and told me to get ready for the voyage  and he would credit
me with a tierce of sugar  and another of rum  he also said that he
had two amiable sisters in philadelphia  from whom i might get some
necessary things  upon this my noble captain desired me to go aboard 
and  knowing the african metal  he charged me not to say any thing of
this matter to any body  and he promised that the lying mate should
not go with him any more  this was a change indeed  in the same hour
to feel the most exquisite pain  and in the turn of a moment the
fullest joy  it caused in me such sensations as i was only able to
express in my looks  my heart was so overpowered with gratitude that i
could have kissed both of their feet  when i left the room i
immediately went  or rather flew  to the vessel  which being loaded 
my master  as good as his word  trusted me with a tierce of rum  and
another of sugar  when we sailed  and arrived safe at the elegant town
of philadelphia  i soon sold my goods here pretty well  and in this
charming place i found every thing plentiful and cheap 

while i was in this place a very extraordinary occurrence befell me  i
had been told one evening of a  wise  woman  a mrs  davis  who
revealed secrets  foretold events   c  i put little faith in this
story at first  as i could not conceive that any mortal could foresee
the future disposals of providence  nor did i believe in any other
revelation than that of the holy scriptures  however  i was greatly
astonished at seeing this woman in a dream that night  though a
person i never before beheld in my life  this made such an impression
on me  that i could not get the idea the next day out of my mind  and
i then became as anxious to see her as i was before indifferent 
accordingly in the evening  after we left off working  i inquired
where she lived  and being directed to her  to my inexpressible
surprise  beheld the very woman in the very same dress she appeared to
me to wear in the vision  she immediately told me i had dreamed of her
the preceding night  related to me many things that had happened with
a correctness that astonished me  and finally told me i should not be
long a slave  this was the more agreeable news  as i believed it the
more readily from her having so faithfully related the past incidents
of my life  she said i should be twice in very great danger of my life
within eighteen months  which  if i escaped  i should afterwards go on
well  so  giving me her blessing  we parted  after staying here some
time till our vessel was loaded  and i had bought in my little
traffic  we sailed from this agreeable spot for montserrat  once more
to encounter the raging surfs 

we arrived safe at montserrat  where we discharged our cargo  and soon
after that we took slaves on board for st  eustatia  and from thence
to georgia  i had always exerted myself and did double work  in order
to make our voyages as short as possible  and from thus over working
myself while we were at georgia i caught a fever and ague  i was very
ill for eleven days and near dying  eternity was now exceedingly
impressed on my mind  and i feared very much that awful event  i
prayed the lord therefore to spare me  and i made a promise in my mind
to god  that i would be good if ever i should recover  at length  from
having an eminent doctor to attend me  i was restored again to health 
and soon after we got the vessel loaded  and set off for montserrat 
during the passage  as i was perfectly restored  and had much business
of the vessel to mind  all my endeavours to keep up my integrity  and
perform my promise to god  began to fail  and  in spite of all i could
do  as we drew nearer and nearer to the islands  my resolutions more
and more declined  as if the very air of that country or climate
seemed fatal to piety  when we were safe arrived at montserrat  and i
had got ashore  i forgot my former resolutions   alas  how prone is
the heart to leave that god it wishes to love  and how strongly do the
things of this world strike the senses and captivate the soul   after
our vessel was discharged  we soon got her ready  and took in  as
usual  some of the poor oppressed natives of africa  and other
negroes  we then set off again for georgia and charlestown  we arrived
at georgia  and  having landed part of our cargo  proceeded to
charlestown with the remainder  while we were there i saw the town
illuminated  the guns were fired  and bonfires and other
demonstrations of joy shewn  on account of the repeal of the stamp
act  here i disposed of some goods on my own account  the white men
buying them with smooth promises and fair words  giving me however but
very indifferent payment  there was one gentleman particularly who
bought a puncheon of rum of me  which gave me a great deal of trouble 
and  although i used the interest of my friendly captain  i could not
obtain any thing for it  for  being a negro man  i could not oblige
him to pay me  this vexed me much  not knowing how to act  and i lost
some time in seeking after this christian  and though  when the
sabbath came  which the negroes usually make their holiday  i was much
inclined to go to public worship  i was obliged to hire some black men
to help to pull a boat across the water to god in quest of this
gentleman  when i found him  after much entreaty  both from myself and
my worthy captain  he at last paid me in dollars  some of them 
however  were copper  and of consequence of no value  but he took
advantage of my being a negro man  and obliged me to put up with those
or none  although i objected to them  immediately after  as i was
trying to pass them in the market  amongst other white men  i was
abused for offering to pass bad coin  and  though i shewed them the
man i got them from  i was within one minute of being tied up and
flogged without either judge or jury  however  by the help of a good
pair of heels  i ran off  and so escaped the bastinadoes i should have
received  i got on board as fast as i could  but still continued in
fear of them until we sailed  which i thanked god we did not long
after  and i have never been amongst them since 

we soon came to georgia  where we were to complete our lading  and
here worse fate than ever attended me  for one sunday night  as i was
with some negroes in their master s yard in the town of savannah  it
happened that their master  one doctor perkins  who was a very severe
and cruel man  came in drunk  and  not liking to see any strange
negroes in his yard  he and a ruffian of a white man he had in his
service beset me in an instant  and both of them struck me with the
first weapons they could get hold of  i cried out as long as i could
for help and mercy  but  though i gave a good account of myself  and
he knew my captain  who lodged hard by him  it was to no purpose  they
beat and mangled me in a shameful manner  leaving me near dead  i lost
so much blood from the wounds i received  that i lay quite motionless 
and was so benumbed that i could not feel any thing for many hours 
early in the morning they took me away to the jail  as i did not
return to the ship all night  my captain  not knowing where i was  and
being uneasy that i did not then make my appearance  he made inquiry
after me  and  having found where i was  immediately came to me  as
soon as the good man saw me so cut and mangled  he could not forbear
weeping  he soon got me out of jail to his lodgings  and immediately
sent for the best doctors in the place  who at first declared it as
their opinion that i could not recover  my captain on this went to all
the lawyers in the town for their advice  but they told him they could
do nothing for me as i was a negro  he then went to doctor perkins 
the hero who had vanquished me  and menaced him  swearing he would be
revenged of him  and challenged him to fight   but cowardice is ever
the companion of cruelty  and the doctor refused  however  by the
skilfulness of one doctor brady of that place  i began at last to
amend  but  although i was so sore and bad with the wounds i had all
over me that i could not rest in any posture  yet i was in more pain
on account of the captain s uneasiness about me than i otherwise
should have been  the worthy man nursed and watched me all the hours
of the night  and i was  through his attention and that of the doctor 
able to get out of bed in about sixteen or eighteen days  all this
time i was very much wanted on board  as i used frequently to go up
and down the river for rafts  and other parts of our cargo  and stow
them when the mate was sick or absent  in about four weeks i was able
to go on duty  and in a fortnight after  having got in all our
lading  our vessel set sail for montserrat  and in less than three
weeks we arrived there safe towards the end of the year  this ended my
adventures in       for i did not leave montserrat again till the
beginning of the following year

every day now brought me nearer my freedom  and i was impatient till
we proceeded again to sea  that i might have an opportunity of getting
a sum large enough to purchase it  i was not long ungratified  for  in
the beginning of the year       my master bought another sloop  named
the nancy  the largest i had ever seen  she was partly laden  and was
to proceed to philadelphia  our captain had his choice of three  and i
was well pleased he chose this  which was the largest  for  from his
having a large vessel  i had more room  and could carry a larger
quantity of goods with me  accordingly  when we had delivered our old
vessel  the prudence  and completed the lading of the nancy  having
made near three hundred per cent  by four barrels of pork i brought
from charlestown  i laid in as large a cargo as i could  trusting to
god s providence to prosper my undertaking  with these views i sailed
for philadelphia  on our passage  when we drew near the land  i was
for the first time surprised at the sight of some whales  having never
seen any such large sea monsters before  and as we sailed by the land
one morning i saw a puppy whale close by the vessel  it was about the
length of a wherry boat  and it followed us all the day till we got
within the capes  we arrived safe and in good time at philadelphia 
and i sold my goods there chiefly to the quakers  they always appeared
to be a very honest discreet sort of people  and never attempted to
impose on me  i therefore liked them  and ever after chose to deal
with them in preference to any others  one sunday morning while i was
here  as i was going to church  i chanced to pass a meeting house  the
doors being open  and the house full of people  it excited my
curiosity to go in  when i entered the house  to my great surprise  i
saw a very tall woman standing in the midst of them  speaking in an
audible voice something which i could not understand  having never
seen anything of this kind before  i stood and stared about me for
some time  wondering at this odd scene  as soon as it was over i took
an opportunity to make inquiry about the place and people  when i was
informed they were called quakers  i particularly asked what that
woman i saw in the midst of them had said  but none of them were
pleased to satisfy me  so i quitted them  and soon after  as i was
returning  i came to a church crowded with people  the church yard was
full likewise  and a number of people were even mounted on ladders 
looking in at the windows  i thought this a strange sight  as i had
never seen churches  either in england or the west indies  crowded in
this manner before  i therefore made bold to ask some people the
meaning of all this  and they told me the rev  mr  george whitfield
was preaching  i had often heard of this gentleman  and had wished to
see and hear him  but i had never before had an opportunity  i now
therefore resolved to gratify myself with the sight  and i pressed in
amidst the multitude  when i got into the church i saw this pious man
exhorting the people with the greatest fervour and earnestness  and
sweating as much as i ever did while in slavery on montserrat beach  i
was very much struck and impressed with this  i thought it strange i
had never seen divines exert themselves in this manner before  and i
was no longer at a loss to account for the thin congregations they
preached to  when we had discharged our cargo here  and were loaded
again  we left this fruitful land once more  and set sail for
montserrat  my traffic had hitherto succeeded so well with me  that i
thought  by selling my goods when we arrived at montserrat  i should
have enough to purchase my freedom  but  as soon as our vessel arrived
there  my master came on board  and gave orders for us to go to st 
eustatia  and discharge our cargo there  and from thence proceed for
georgia  i was much disappointed at this  but thinking  as usual  it
was of no use to encounter with the decrees of fate  i submitted
without repining  and we went to st  eustatia  after we had discharged
our cargo there we took in a live cargo  as we call a cargo of slaves 
here i sold my goods tolerably well  but  not being able to lay out
all my money in this small island to as much advantage as in many
other places  i laid out only part  and the remainder i brought away
with me neat  we sailed from hence for georgia  and i was glad when we
got there  though i had not much reason to like the place from my last
adventure in savannah  but i longed to get back to montserrat and
procure my freedom  which i expected to be able to purchase when i
returned  as soon as we arrived here i waited on my careful doctor 
mr  brady  to whom i made the most grateful acknowledgments in my
power for his former kindness and attention during my illness  while
we were here an odd circumstance happened to the captain and me  which
disappointed us both a good deal  a silversmith  whom we had brought
to this place some voyages before  agreed with the captain to return
with us to the west indies  and promised at the same time to give the
captain a great deal of money  having pretended to take a liking to
him  and being  as we thought  very rich  but while we stayed to load
our vessel this man was taken ill in a house where he worked  and in a
week s time became very bad  the worse he grew the more he used to
speak of giving the captain what he had promised him  so that he
expected something considerable from the death of this man  who had no
wife or child  and he attended him day and night  i used also to go
with the captain  at his own desire  to attend him  especially when we
saw there was no appearance of his recovery  and  in order to
recompense me for my trouble  the captain promised me ten pounds  when
he should get the man s property  i thought this would be of great
service to me  although i had nearly money enough to purchase my
freedom  if i should get safe this voyage to montserrat  in this
expectation i laid out above eight pounds of my money for a suit of
superfine clothes to dance with at my freedom  which i hoped was then
at hand  we still continued to attend this man  and were with him even
on the last day he lived  till very late at night  when we went on
board  after we were got to bed  about one or two o clock in the
morning  the captain was sent for  and informed the man was dead  on
this he came to my bed  and  waking me  informed me of it  and desired
me to get up and procure a light  and immediately go to him  i told
him i was very sleepy  and wished he would take somebody else with
him  or else  as the man was dead  and could want no farther
attendance  to let all things remain as they were till the next
morning   no  no   said he   we will have the money to night  i cannot
wait till to morrow  so let us go   accordingly i got up and struck a
light  and away we both went and saw the man as dead as we could wish 
the captain said he would give him a grand burial  in gratitude for
the promised treasure  and desired that all the things belonging to
the deceased might be brought forth  among others  there was a nest of
trunks of which he had kept the keys whilst the man was ill  and when
they were produced we opened them with no small eagerness and
expectation  and as there were a great number within one another  with
much impatience we took them one out of the other  at last  when we
came to the smallest  and had opened it  we saw it was full of papers 
which we supposed to be notes  at the sight of which our hearts leapt
for joy  and that instant the captain  clapping his hands  cried out 
 thank god  here it is   but when we took up the trunk  and began to
examine the supposed treasure and long looked for bounty   alas  alas 
how uncertain and deceitful are all human affairs   what had we found 
while we thought we were embracing a substance we grasped an empty
nothing  the whole amount that was in the nest of trunks was only one
dollar and a half  and all that the man possessed would not pay for
his coffin  our sudden and exquisite joy was now succeeded by a sudden
and exquisite pain  and my captain and i exhibited  for some time 
most ridiculous figures  pictures of chagrin and disappointment  we
went away greatly mortified  and left the deceased to do as well as he
could for himself  as we had taken so good care of him when alive for
nothing  we set sail once more for montserrat  and arrived there safe 
but much out of humour with our friend the silversmith  when we had
unladen the vessel  and i had sold my venture  finding myself master
of about forty seven pounds  i consulted my true friend  the captain 
how i should proceed in offering my master the money for my freedom 
he told me to come on a certain morning  when he and my master would
be at breakfast together  accordingly  on that morning i went  and met
the captain there  as he had appointed  when i went in i made my
obeisance to my master  and with my money in my hand  and many fears
in my heart  i prayed him to be as good as his offer to me  when he
was pleased to promise me my freedom as soon as i could purchase it 
this speech seemed to confound him  he began to recoil  and my heart
that instant sunk within me   what   said he   give you your freedom 
why  where did you get the money  have you got forty pounds sterling  
 yes  sir   i answered   how did you get it   replied he  i told him 
very honestly  the captain then said he knew i got the money very
honestly and with much industry  and that i was particularly careful 
on which my master replied  i got money much faster than he did  and
said he would not have made me the promise he did if he had thought i
should have got money so soon   come  come   said my worthy captain 
clapping my master on the back   come  robert   which was his name  i
think you must let him have his freedom  you have laid your money out
very well  you have received good interest for it all this time  and
here is now the principal at last  i know gustavus has earned you more
than an hundred a year  and he will still save you money  as he will
not leave you   come  robert  take the money   my master then said  he
would not be worse than his promise  and  taking the money  told me to
go to the secretary at the register office  and get my manumission
drawn up  these words of my master were like a voice from heaven to
me  in an instant all my trepidation was turned into unutterable
bliss  and i most reverently bowed myself with gratitude  unable to
express my feelings  but by the overflowing of my eyes  while my true
and worthy friend  the captain  congratulated us both with a peculiar
degree of heartfelt pleasure  as soon as the first transports of my
joy were over  and that i had expressed my thanks to these my worthy
friends in the best manner i was able  i rose with a heart full of
affection and reverence  and left the room  in order to obey my
master s joyful mandate of going to the register office  as i was
leaving the house i called to mind the words of the psalmist  in the
   th psalm  and like him   i glorified god in my heart  in whom i
trusted   these words had been impressed on my mind from the very day
i was forced from deptford to the present hour  and i now saw them  as
i thought  fulfilled and verified  my imagination was all rapture as i
flew to the register office  and  in this respect  like the apostle
peter  u   whose deliverance from prison was so sudden and
extraordinary  that he thought he was in a vision  i could scarcely
believe i was awake  heavens  who could do justice to my feelings at
this moment  not conquering heroes themselves  in the midst of a
triumph  not the tender mother who has just regained her long lost
infant  and presses it to her heart  not the weary hungry mariner  at
the sight of the desired friendly port  not the lover  when he once
more embraces his beloved mistress  after she had been ravished from
his arms   all within my breast was tumult  wildness  and delirium  my
feet scarcely touched the ground  for they were winged with joy  and 
like elijah  as he rose to heaven  they  were with lightning sped as i
went on   every one i met i told of my happiness  and blazed about the
virtue of my amiable master and captain 

when i got to the office and acquainted the register with my errand he
congratulated me on the occasion  and told me he would draw up my
manumission for half price  which was a guinea  i thanked him for his
kindness  and  having received it and paid him  i hastened to my
master to get him to sign it  that i might be fully released 
accordingly he signed the manumission that day  so that  before night 
i who had been a slave in the morning  trembling at the will of
another  was become my own master  and completely free  i thought this
was the happiest day i had ever experienced  and my joy was still
heightened by the blessings and prayers of the sable race 
particularly the aged  to whom my heart had ever been attached with
reverence 

                                        

as the form of my manumission has something peculiar in it  and
expresses the absolute power and dominion one man claims over his
fellow  i shall beg leave to present it before my readers at full

in short  the fair as well as black people immediately styled me by a
new appellation  to me the most desirable in the world  which was
freeman  and at the dances i gave my georgia superfine blue clothes
made no indifferent appearance  as i thought  some of the sable
females  who formerly stood aloof  now began to relax and appear less
coy  but my heart was still fixed on london  where i hoped to be ere
long  so that my worthy captain and his owner  my late master 
finding that the bent of my mind was towards london  said to me   we
hope you won t leave us  but that you will still be with the vessels  
here gratitude bowed me down  and none but the generous mind can judge
of my feelings  struggling between inclination and duty  however 
notwithstanding my wish to be in london  i obediently answered my
benefactors that i would go in the vessel  and not leave them  and
from that day i was entered on board as an able bodied sailor  at
thirty six shillings per month  besides what perquisites i could make 
my intention was to make a voyage or two  entirely to please these my
honoured patrons  but i determined that the year following  if it
pleased god  i would see old england once more  and surprise my old
master  capt  pascal  who was hourly in my mind  for i still loved
him  notwithstanding his usage of me  and i pleased myself with
thinking of what he would say when he saw what the lord had done for
me in so short a time  instead of being  as he might perhaps suppose 
under the cruel yoke of some planter  with these kind of reveries i
used often to entertain myself  and shorten the time till my return 
and now  being as in my original free african state  i embarked on
board the nancy  after having got all things ready for our voyage  in
this state of serenity we sailed for st  eustatia  and  having smooth
seas and calm weather  we soon arrived there  after taking our cargo
on board  we proceeded to savannah in georgia  in august        while
we were there  as usual  i used to go for the cargo up the rivers in
boats  and on this business i have been frequently beset by
alligators  which were very numerous on that coast  and i have shot
many of them when they have been near getting into our boats  which we
have with great difficulty sometimes prevented  and have been very
much frightened at them  i have seen a young one sold in georgia alive
for six pence  during our stay at this place  one evening a slave
belonging to mr  read  a merchant of savannah  came near our vessel 
and began to use me very ill  i entreated him  with all the patience i
was master of  to desist  as i knew there was little or no law for a
free negro here  but the fellow  instead of taking my advice 
persevered in his insults  and even struck me  at this i lost all
temper  and i fell on him and beat him soundly  the next morning his
master came to our vessel as we lay alongside the wharf  and desired
me to come ashore that he might have me flogged all round the town 
for beating his negro slave  i told him he had insulted me  and had
given the provocation  by first striking me  i had told my captain
also the whole affair that morning  and wished him to have gone along
with me to mr  read  to prevent bad consequences  but he said that it
did not signify  and if mr  read said any thing he would make matters
up  and had desired me to go to work  which i accordingly did  the
captain being on board when mr  read came  he told him i was a free
man  and when mr  read applied to him to deliver me up  he said he
knew nothing of the matter  i was astonished and frightened at this 
and thought i had better keep where i was than go ashore and be
flogged round the town  without judge or jury  i therefore refused to
stir  and mr  read went away  swearing he would bring all the
constables in the town  for he would have me out of the vessel  when
he was gone  i thought his threat might prove too true to my sorrow 
and i was confirmed in this belief  as well by the many instances i
had seen of the treatment of free negroes  as from a fact that had
happened within my own knowledge here a short time before  there was a
free black man  a carpenter  that i knew  who  for asking a gentleman
that he worked for for the money he had earned  was put into gaol  and
afterwards this oppressed man was sent from georgia  with false
accusations  of an intention to set the gentleman s house on fire  and
run away with his slaves  i was therefore much embarrassed  and very
apprehensive of a flogging at least  i dreaded  of all things  the
thoughts of being striped  as i never in my life had the marks of any
violence of that kind  at that instant a rage seized my soul  and for
a little i determined to resist the first man that should offer to lay
violent hands on me  or basely use me without a trial  for i would
sooner die like a free man  than suffer myself to be scourged by the
hands of ruffians  and my blood drawn like a slave  the captain and
others  more cautious  advised me to make haste and conceal myself 
for they said mr  read was a very spiteful man  and he would soon come
on board with constables and take me  at first i refused this counsel 
being determined to stand my ground  but at length  by the prevailing
entreaties of the captain and mr  dixon  with whom he lodged  i went
to mr  dixon s house  which was a little out of town  at a place
called yea ma chra  i was but just gone when mr  read  with the
constables  came for me  and searched the vessel  but  not finding me
there  he swore he would have me dead or alive  i was secreted about
five days  however  the good character which my captain always gave me
as well as some other gentlemen who also knew me  procured me some
friends  at last some of them told my captain that he did not use me
well  in suffering me thus to be imposed upon  and said they would see
me redressed  and get me on board some other vessel  my captain  on
this  immediately went to mr  read  and told him  that ever since i
eloped from the vessel his work had been neglected  and he could not
go on with her loading  himself and mate not being well  and  as i had
managed things on board for them  my absence must retard his voyage 
and consequently hurt the owner  he therefore begged of him to forgive
me  as he said he never had any complaint of me before  for the many
years that i had been with him  after repeated entreaties  mr  read
said i might go to hell  and that he would not meddle with me  on
which my captain came immediately to me at his lodging  and  telling
me how pleasantly matters had gone on  he desired me to go on board 
some of my other friends then asked him if he had got the constable s
warrant from them  the captain said  no  on this i was desired by them
to stay in the house  and they said they would get me on board of some
other vessel before the evening  when the captain heard this he became
almost distracted  he went immediately for the warrant  and  after
using every exertion in his power  he at last got it from my hunters 
but i had all the expenses to pay  after i had thanked all my friends
for their attention  i went on board again to my work  of which i had
always plenty  we were in haste to complete our lading  and were to
carry twenty head of cattle with us to the west indies  where they are
a very profitable article  in order to encourage me in working  and to
make up for the time i had lost  my captain promised me the privilege
of carrying two bullocks of my own with me  and this made me work with
redoubled ardour  as soon as i had got the vessel loaded  in doing
which i was obliged to perform the duty of the mate as well as my own
work  and that the bullocks were near coming on board  i asked the
captain leave to bring my two  according to his promise  but  to my
great surprise  he told me there was no room for them  i then asked
him to permit me to take one  but he said he could not  i was a good
deal mortified at this usage  and told him i had no notion that he
intended thus to impose on me  nor could i think well of any man that
was so much worse than his word  on this we had some disagreement  and
i gave him to understand  that i intended to leave the vessel  at this
he appeared to be very much dejected  and our mate  who had been very
sickly  and whose duty had long devolved upon me  advised him to
persuade me to stay  in consequence of which he spoke very kindly to
me  making many fair promises  telling me that  as the mate was so
sickly  he could not do without me  and that  as the safety of the
vessel and cargo depended greatly upon me  he therefore hoped that i
would not be offended at what had passed between us  and swore he
would make up all matters when we arrived in the west indies  so i
consented to slave on as before  soon after this  as the bullocks were
coming on board  one of them ran at the captain  and butted him so
furiously in the breast  that he never recovered of the blow  in order
to make me some amends for his treatment about the bullocks  the
captain now pressed me very much to take some turkeys  and other
fowls  with me  and gave me liberty to take as many as i could find
room for  but i told him he knew very well i had never carried any
turkeys before  as i always thought they were such tender birds that
they were not fit to cross the seas  however  he continued to press me
to buy them for once  and  what was very surprising to me  the more i
was against it  the more he urged my taking them  insomuch that he
ensured me from all losses that might happen by them  and i was
prevailed on to take them  but i thought this very strange  as he had
never acted so with me before  this  and not being able to dispose of
my paper money in any other way  induced me at length to take four
dozen  the turkeys  however  i was so dissatisfied about that i
determined to make no more voyages to this quarter  nor with this
captain  and was very apprehensive that my free voyage would be the
worst i had ever made  we set sail for montserrat  the captain and
mate had been both complaining of sickness when we sailed  and as we
proceeded on our voyage they grew worse  this was about november  and
we had not been long at sea before we began to meet with strong
northerly gales and rough seas  and in about seven or eight days all
the bullocks were near being drowned  and four or five of them died 
our vessel  which had not been tight at first  was much less so now 
and  though we were but nine in the whole  including five sailors and
myself  yet we were obliged to attend to the pumps every half or three
quarters of an hour  the captain and mate came on deck as often as
they were able  which was now but seldom  for they declined so fast 
that they were not well enough to make observations above four or five
times the whole voyage  the whole care of the vessel rested 
therefore  upon me  and i was obliged to direct her by my former
experience  not being able to work a traverse  the captain was now
very sorry he had not taught me navigation  and protested  if ever he
should get well again  he would not fail to do so  but in about
seventeen days his illness increased so much  that he was obliged to
keep his bed  continuing sensible  however  till the last  constantly
having the owner s interest at heart  for this just and benevolent man
ever appeared much concerned about the welfare of what he was
intrusted with  when this dear friend found the symptoms of death
approaching  he called me by my name  and  when i came to him  he
asked  with almost his last breath  if he had ever done me any harm 
 god forbid i should think so   i replied   i should then be the most
ungrateful of wretches to the best of sorrow by his bedside  he
expired without saying another word  and the day following we
committed his body to the deep  every man on board loved this man  and
regretted his death  but i was exceedingly affected at it  and i found
that i did not know  till he was gone  the strength of my regard for
him  indeed i had every reason in the world to be attached to him 
for  besides that he was in general mild  affable  generous  faithful 
benevolent  and just  he was to me a friend and a father  and  had it
pleased providence that he had died but five months before  i verily
believe i should not have obtained my freedom when i did  and it is
not improbable that i might not have been able to get it at any rate
afterwards  the captain being dead  the mate came on the deck  and
made such observations as he was able  but to no purpose  in the
course of a few days more  the few bullocks that remained were found
dead  but the turkies i had  though on the deck  and exposed to so
much wet and bad weather  did well  and i afterwards gained near three
hundred per cent  on the sale of them  so that in the event it proved
a happy circumstance for me that i had not bought the bullocks i
intended  for they must have perished with the rest  and i could not
help looking on this  otherwise trifling circumstance  as a particular
providence of god  and i was thankful accordingly  the care of the
vessel took up all my time  and engaged my attention entirely  as we
were now out of the variable winds  i thought i should not be much
puzzled to hit upon the islands  i was persuaded i steered right for
antigua  which i wished to reach  as the nearest to us  and in the
course of nine or ten days we made this island  to our great joy  and
the next day after we came safe to montserrat  many were surprised
when they heard of my conducting the sloop into the port  and i now
obtained a new appellation  and was called captain  this elated me not
a little  and it was quite flattering to my vanity to be thus styled
by as high a title as any free man in this place possessed  when the
death of the captain became known  he was much regretted by all who
knew him  for he was a man universally respected  at the same time the
sable captain lost no fame  for the success i had met with increased
the affection of my friends in no small measure

as i had now  by the death of my captain  lost my great benefactor and
friend  i had little inducement to remain longer in the west indies 
except my gratitude to mr  king  which i thought i had pretty well
discharged in bringing back his vessel safe  and delivering his cargo
to his satisfaction  i began to think of leaving this part of the
world  of which i had been long tired  and returning to england  where
my heart had always been  but mr  king still pressed me very much to
stay with his vessel  and he had done so much for me that i found
myself unable to refuse his requests  and consented to go another
voyage to georgia  as the mate  from his ill state of health  was
quite useless in the vessel  accordingly a new captain was appointed 
whose name was william phillips  an old acquaintance of mine  and 
having refitted our vessel  and taken several slaves on board  we set
sail for st  eustatia  where we stayed but a few days  and on the   th
of january      we steered for georgia  our new captain boasted
strangely of his skill in navigating and conducting a vessel  and in
consequence of this he steered a new course  several points more to
the westward than we ever did before  this appeared to me very
extraordinary 

on the fourth of february  which was soon after we had got into our
new course  i dreamt the ship was wrecked amidst the surfs and rocks 
and that i was the means of saving every one on board  and on the
night following i dreamed the very same dream  these dreams however
made no impression on my mind  and the next evening  it being my watch
below  i was pumping the vessel a little after eight o clock  just
before i went off the deck  as is the custom  and being weary with the
duty of the day  and tired at the pump   for we made a good deal of
water  i began to express my impatience  and i uttered with an oath 
 damn the vessel s bottom out   but my conscience instantly smote me
for the expression  when i left the deck i went to bed  and had
scarcely fallen asleep when i dreamed the same dream again about the
ship that i had dreamt the two preceeding nights  at twelve o clock
the watch was changed  and  as i had always the charge of the
captain s watch  i then went upon deck  at half after one in the
morning the man at the helm saw something under the lee beam that the
sea washed against  and he immediately called to me that there was a
grampus  and desired me to look at it  accordingly i stood up and
observed it for some time  but  when i saw the sea wash up against it
again and again  i said it was not a fish but a rock  being soon
certain of this  i went down to the captain  and  with some confusion 
told him the danger we were in  and desired him to come upon deck
immediately  he said it was very well  and i went up again  as soon as
i was upon deck the wind  which had been pretty high  having abated a
little  the vessel began to be carried sideways towards the rock  by
means of the current  still the captain did not appear  i therefore
went to him again  and told him the vessel was then near a large rock 
and desired he would come up with speed  he said he would  and i
returned to the deck  when i was upon the deck again i saw we were not
above a pistol shot from the rock  and i heard the noise of the
breakers all around us  i was exceedingly alarmed at this  and the
captain having not yet come on the deck i lost all patience  and 
growing quite enraged  i ran down to him again  and asked him why he
did not come up  and what he could mean by all this   the breakers  
said i   are round us  and the vessel is almost on the rock   with
that he came on the deck with me  and we tried to put the vessel
about  and get her out of the current  but all to no purpose  the
wind being very small  we then called all hands up immediately  and
after a little we got up one end of a cable  and fastened it to the
anchor  by this time the surf was foaming round us  and made a
dreadful noise on the breakers  and the very moment we let the anchor
go the vessel struck against the rocks  one swell now succeeded
another  as it were one wave calling on its fellow  the roaring of the
billows increased  and  with one single heave of the swells  the sloop
was pierced and transfixed among the rocks  in a moment a scene of
horror presented itself to my mind  such as i never had conceived or
experienced before  all my sins stared me in the face  and especially 
i thought that god had hurled his direful vengeance on my guilty head
for cursing the vessel on which my life depended  my spirits at this
forsook me  and i expected every moment to go to the bottom  i
determined if i should still be saved that i would never swear again 
and in the midst of my distress  while the dreadful surfs were dashing
with unremitting fury among the rocks  i remembered the lord  though
fearful that i was undeserving of forgiveness  and i thought that as
he had often delivered he might yet deliver  and  calling to mind the
many mercies he had shewn me in times past  they gave me some small
hope that he might still help me  i then began to think how we might
be saved  and i believe no mind was ever like mine so replete with
inventions and confused with schemes  though how to escape death i
knew not  the captain immediately ordered the hatches to be nailed
down on the slaves in the hold  where there were above twenty  all of
whom must unavoidably have perished if he had been obeyed  when he
desired the man to nail down the hatches i thought that my sin was the
cause of this  and that god would charge me with these people s blood 
this thought rushed upon my mind that instant with such violence  that
it quite overpowered me  and i fainted  i recovered just as the people
were about to nail down the hatches  perceiving which  i desired them
to stop  the captain then said it must be done  i asked him why  he
said that every one would endeavour to get into the boat  which was
but small  and thereby we should be drowned  for it would not have
carried above ten at the most  i could no longer restrain my emotion 
and i told him he deserved drowning for not knowing how to navigate
the vessel  and i believe the people would have tossed him overboard
if i had given them the least hint of it  however the hatches were not
nailed down  and  as none of us could leave the vessel then on account
of the darkness  and as we knew not where to go  and were convinced
besides that the boat could not survive the surfs  we all said we
would remain on the dry part of the vessel  and trust to god till
daylight appeared  when we should know better what to do 

i then advised to get the boat prepared against morning  and some of
us began to set about it  but some abandoned all care of the ship and
themselves  and fell to drinking  our boat had a piece out of her
bottom near two feet long  and we had no materials to mend her 
however  necessity being the mother of invention  i took some pump
leather and nailed it to the broken part  and plastered it over with
tallow grease  and  thus prepared  with the utmost anxiety of mind we
watched for daylight  and thought every minute an hour till it
appeared  at last it saluted our longing eyes  and kind providence
accompanied its approach with what was no small comfort to us  for the
dreadful swell began to subside  and the next thing that we discovered
to raise our drooping spirits  was a small key or island  about five
or six miles off  but a barrier soon presented itself  for there was
not water enough for our boat to go over the reefs  and this threw us
again into a sad consternation  but there was no alternative  we were
therefore obliged to put but few in the boat at once  and  what is
still worse  all of us were frequently under the necessity of getting
out to drag and lift it over the reefs  this cost us much labour and
fatigue  and  what was yet more distressing  we could not avoid having
our legs cut and torn very much with the rocks  there were only four
people that would work with me at the oars  and they consisted of
three black men and a dutch creole sailor  and  though we went with
the boat five times that day  we had no others to assist us  but  had
we not worked in this manner  i really believe the people could not
have been saved  for not one of the white men did any thing to
preserve their lives  and indeed they soon got so drunk that they were
not able  but lay about the deck like swine  so that we were at last
obliged to lift them into the boat and carry them on shore by force 
this want of assistance made our labour intolerably severe  insomuch 
that  by putting on shore so often that day  the skin was entirely
stript off my hands 

however  we continued all the day to toil and strain our exertions 
till we had brought all on board safe to the shore  so that out of
thirty two people we lost not one  my dream now returned upon my mind
with all its force  it was fulfilled in every part  for our danger was
the same i had dreamt of  and i could not help looking on myself as
the principal instrument in effecting our deliverance  for  owing to
some of our people getting drunk  the rest of us were obliged to
double our exertions  and it was fortunate we did  for in a very
little time longer the patch of leather on the boat would have been
worn out  and she would have been no longer fit for service  situated
as we were  who could think that men should be so careless of the
danger they were in  for  if the wind had but raised the swell as it
was when the vessel struck  we must have bid a final farewell to all
hopes of deliverance  and though  i warned the people who were
drinking and entreated them to embrace the moment of deliverance 
nevertheless they persisted  as if not possessed of the least spark of
reason  i could not help thinking  that  if any of these people had
been lost  god would charge me with their lives  which  perhaps  was
one cause of my labouring so hard for their preservation  and indeed
every one of them afterwards seemed so sensible of the service i had
rendered them  and while we were on the key i was a kind of chieftain
amongst them  i brought some limes  oranges  and lemons ashore  and 
finding it to be a good soil where we were  i planted several of them
as a token to any one that might be cast away hereafter  this key  as
we afterwards found  was one of the bahama islands  which consist of a
cluster of large islands  with smaller ones or keys  as they are
called  interspersed among them  it was about a mile in circumference 
with a white sandy beach running in a regular order along it  on that
part of it where we first attempted to land there stood some very
large birds  called flamingoes  these  from the reflection of the sun 
appeared to us at a little distance as large as men  and  when they
walked backwards and forwards  we could not conceive what they were 
our captain swore they were cannibals  this created a great panic
among us  and we held a consultation how to act  the captain wanted to
go to a key that was within sight  but a great way off  but i was
against it  as in so doing we should not be able to save all the
people   and therefore   said i   let us go on shore here  and perhaps
these cannibals may take to the water   accordingly we steered towards
them  and when we approached them  to our very great joy and no less
wonder  they walked off one after the other very deliberately  and at
last they took flight and relieved us entirely from our fears  about
the key there were turtles and several sorts of fish in such abundance
that we caught them without bait  which was a great relief to us after
the salt provisions on board  there was also a large rock on the
beach  about ten feet high  which was in the form of a punch bowl at
the top  this we could not help thinking providence had ordained to
supply us with rainwater  and it was something singular that  if we
did not take the water when it rained  in some little time after it
would turn as salt as sea water 

our first care  after refreshment  was to make ourselves tents to
lodge in  which we did as well as we could with some sails we had
brought from the ship  we then began to think how we might get from
this place  which was quite uninhabited  and we determined to repair
our boat  which was very much shattered  and to put to sea in quest of
a ship or some inhabited island  it took us up however eleven days
before we could get the boat ready for sea in the manner we wanted it 
with a sail and other necessaries  when we had got all things prepared
the captain wanted me to stay on shore while he went to sea in quest
of a vessel to take all the people off the key  but this i refused 
and the captain and myself  with five more  set off in the boat
towards new providence  we had no more than two musket load of
gunpowder with us if any thing should happen  and our stock of
provisions consisted of three gallons of rum  four of water  some salt
beef  some biscuit  and in this manner we proceeded to sea 

on the second day of our voyage we came to an island called obbico 
the largest of the bahama islands  we were much in want of water  for
by this time our water was expended  and we were exceedingly fatigued
in pulling two days in the heat of the sun  and it being late in the
evening  we hauled the boat ashore to try for water and remain during
the night  when we came ashore we searched for water  but could find
none  when it was dark  we made a fire around us for fear of the wild
beasts  as the place was an entire thick wood  and we took it by turns
to watch  in this situation we found very little rest  and waited with
impatience for the morning  as soon as the light appeared we set off
again with our boat  in hopes of finding assistance during the day  we
were now much dejected and weakened by pulling the boat  for our sail
was of no use  and we were almost famished for want of fresh water to
drink  we had nothing left to eat but salt beef  and that we could not
use without water  in this situation we toiled all day in sight of the
island  which was very long  in the evening  seeing no relief  we made
ashore again  and fastened our boat  we then went to look for fresh
water  being quite faint for the want of it  and we dug and searched
about for some all the remainder of the evening  but could not find
one drop  so that our dejection at this period became excessive  and
our terror so great  that we expected nothing but death to deliver us 
we could not touch our beef  which was as salt as brine  without fresh
water  and we were in the greatest terror from the apprehension of
wild beasts  when unwelcome night came we acted as on the night
before  and the next morning we set off again from the island in hopes
of seeing some vessel  in this manner we toiled as well as we were
able till four o clock  during which we passed several keys  but could
not meet with a ship  and  still famishing with thirst  went ashore on
one of those keys again in hopes of finding some water  here we found
some leaves with a few drops of water in them  which we lapped with
much eagerness  we then dug in several places  but without success  as
we were digging holes in search of water there came forth some very
thick and black stuff  but none of us could touch it  except the poor
dutch creole  who drank above a quart of it as eagerly as if it had
been wine  we tried to catch fish  but could not  and we now began to
repine at our fate  and abandon ourselves to despair  when  in the
midst of our murmuring  the captain all at once cried out  a sail  a
sail  a sail   this gladdening sound was like a reprieve to a
convict  and we all instantly turned to look at it  but in a little
time some of us began to be afraid it was not a sail  however  at a
venture  we embarked and steered after it  and  in half an hour  to
our unspeakable joy  we plainly saw that it was a vessel  at this our
drooping spirits revived  and we made towards her with all the speed
imaginable  when we came near to her  we found she was a little sloop 
about the size of a gravesend hoy  and quite full of people  a
circumstance which we could not make out the meaning of  our captain 
who was a welchman  swore that they were pirates  and would kill us  i
said  be that as it might  we must board her if we were to die for it 
and  if they should not receive us kindly  we must oppose them as well
as we could  for there was no alternative between their perishing and
ours  this counsel was immediately taken  and i really believe that
the captain  myself  and the dutchman  would then have faced twenty
men  we had two cutlasses and a musquet  that i brought in the boat 
and  in this situation  we rowed alongside  and immediately boarded
her  i believe there were about forty hands on board  but how great
was our surprise  as soon as we got on board  to find that the major
part of them were in the same predicament as ourselves 

they belonged to a whaling schooner that was wrecked two days before
us about nine miles to the north of our vessel  when she was wrecked
some of them had taken to their boats and had left some of their
people and property on a key  in the same manner as we had done  and
were going  like us  to new providence in quest of a ship  when they
met with this little sloop  called a wrecker  their employment in
those seas being to look after wrecks  they were then going to take
the remainder of the people belonging to the schooner  for which the
wrecker was to have all things belonging to the vessel  and likewise
their people s help to get what they could out of her  and were then
to carry the crew to new providence 

we told the people of the wrecker the condition of our vessel  and we
made the same agreement with them as the schooner s people  and  on
their complying  we begged of them to go to our key directly  because
our people were in want of water  they agreed  therefore  to go along
with us first  and in two days we arrived at the key  to the
inexpressible joy of the people that we had left behind  as they had
been reduced to great extremities for want of water in our absence 
luckily for us  the wrecker had now more people on board than she
could carry or victual for any moderate length of time  they therefore
hired the schooner s people to work on our wreck  and we left them our
boat  and embarked for new providence 

nothing could have been more fortunate than our meeting with this
wrecker  for new providence was at such a distance that we never could
have reached it in our boat  the island of abbico was much longer than
we expected  and it was not till after sailing for three or four days
that we got safe to the farther end of it  towards new providence 
when we arrived there we watered  and got a good many lobsters and
other shellfish  which proved a great relief to us  as our provisions
and water were almost exhausted  we then proceeded on our voyage  but
the day after we left the island  late in the evening  and whilst we
were yet amongst the bahama keys  we were overtaken by a violent gale
of wind  so that we were obliged to cut away the mast  the vessel was
very near foundering  for she parted from her anchors  and struck
several times on the shoals  here we expected every minute that she
would have gone to pieces  and each moment to be our last  so much so
that my old captain and sickly useless mate  and several others 
fainted  and death stared us in the face on every side  all the
swearers on board now began to call on the god of heaven to assist
them  and  sure enough  beyond our comprehension he did assist us  and
in a miraculous manner delivered us  in the very height of our
extremity the wind lulled for a few minutes  and  although the swell
was high beyond expression  two men  who were expert swimmers 
attempted to go to the buoy of the anchor  which we still saw on the
water  at some distance  in a little punt that belonged to the
wrecker  which was not large enough to carry more than two  she filled
different times in their endeavours to get into her alongside of our
vessel  and they saw nothing but death before them  as well as we  but
they said they might as well die that way as any other  a coil of very
small rope  with a little buoy  was put in along with them  and  at
last  with great hazard  they got the punt clear from the vessel  and
these two intrepid water heroes paddled away for life towards the buoy
of the anchor  the eyes of us all were fixed on them all the time 
expecting every minute to be their last  and the prayers of all those
that remained in their senses were offered up to god  on their behalf 
for a speedy deliverance  and for our own  which depended on them  and
he heard and answered us  these two men at last reached the buoy  and 
having fastened the punt to it  they tied one end of their rope to the
small buoy that they had in the punt  and sent it adrift towards the
vessel  we on board observing this threw out boat hooks and leads
fastened to lines  in order to catch the buoy  at last we caught it 
and fastened a hawser to the end of the small rope  we then gave them
a sign to pull  and they pulled the hawser to them  and fastened it to
the buoy  which being done we hauled for our lives  and  through the
mercy of god  we got again from the shoals into deep water  and the
punt got safe to the vessel  it is impossible for any to conceive our
heartfelt joy at this second deliverance from ruin  but those who have
suffered the same hardships  those whose strength and senses were gone
came to themselves  and were now as elated as they were before
depressed  two days after this the wind ceased  and the water became
smooth  the punt then went on shore  and we cut down some trees  and
having found our mast and mended it we brought it on board  and fixed
it up  as soon as we had done this we got up the anchor  and away we
went once more for new providence  which in three days more we reached
safe  after having been above three weeks in a situation in which we
did not expect to escape with life  the inhabitants here were very
kind to us  and  when they learned our situation  shewed us a great
deal of hospitality and friendship  soon after this every one of my
old fellow sufferers that were free parted from us  and shaped their
course where their inclination led them  one merchant  who had a large
sloop  seeing our condition  and knowing we wanted to go to georgia 
told four of us that his vessel was going there  and  if we would work
on board and load her  he would give us our passage free  as we could
not get any wages whatever  and found it very hard to get off the
place  we were obliged to consent to his proposal  and we went on
board and helped to load the sloop  though we had only our victuals
allowed us  when she was entirely loaded he told us she was going to
jamaica first  where we must go if we went in her  this  however  i
refused  but my fellow sufferers not having any money to help
themselves with  necessity obliged them to accept of the offer  and to
steer that course  though they did not like it 

we stayed in new providence about seventeen or eighteen days  during
which time i met with many friends  who gave me encouragement to stay
there with them  but i declined it  though  had not my heart been
fixed on england  i should have stayed  as i liked the place
extremely  and there were some free black people here who were very
happy  and we passed our time pleasantly together  with the melodious
sound of the catguts  under the lime and lemon trees  at length
captain phillips hired a sloop to carry him and some of the slaves
that he could not sell to georgia  and i agreed to go with him in this
vessel  meaning now to take my farewell of that place  when the vessel
was ready we all embarked  and i took my leave of new providence  not
without regret  we sailed about four o clock in the morning  with a
fair wind  for georgia  and about eleven o clock the same morning a
short and sudden gale sprung up and blew away most of our sails  and 
as we were still amongst the keys  in a very few minutes it dashed the
sloop against the rocks  luckily for us the water was deep  and the
sea was not so angry but that  after having for some time laboured
hard  and being many in number  we were saved through god s mercy 
and  by using our greatest exertions  we got the vessel off  the next
day we returned to providence  where we soon got her again refitted 
some of the people swore that we had spells set upon us by somebody in
montserrat  and others that we had witches and wizzards amongst the
poor helpless slaves  and that we never should arrive safe at georgia 
but these things did not deter me  i said   let us again face the
winds and seas  and swear not  but trust to god  and he will deliver
us   we therefore once more set sail  and  with hard labour  in seven
day s time arrived safe at georgia 

after our arrival we went up to the town of savannah  and the same
evening i went to a friend s house to lodge  whose name was mosa  a
black man  we were very happy at meeting each other  and after supper
we had a light till it was between nine and ten o clock at night 
about that time the watch or patrol came by  and  discerning a light
in the house  they knocked at the door  we opened it  and they came in
and sat down  and drank some punch with us  they also begged some
limes of me  as they understood i had some  which i readily gave them 
a little after this they told me i must go to the watch house with
them  this surprised me a good deal  after our kindness to them  and i
asked them  why so  they said that all negroes who had light in their
houses after nine o clock were to be taken into custody  and either
pay some dollars or be flogged  some of those people knew that i was a
free man  but  as the man of the house was not free  and had his
master to protect him  they did not take the same liberty with him
they did with me  i told them that i was a free man  and just arrived
from providence  that we were not making any noise  and that i was not
a stranger in that place  but was very well known there   besides  
said i   what will you do with me     that you shall see   replied
they   but you must go to the watch house with us   now whether they
meant to get money from me or not i was at a loss to know  but i
thought immediately of the oranges and limes at santa cruz  and seeing
that nothing would pacify them i went with them to the watch house 
where i remained during the night  early the the next morning these
imposing ruffians flogged a negro man and woman that they had in the
watch house  and then they told me that i must be flogged too  i asked
why  and if there was no law for free men  and told them if there was
i would have it put in force against them  but this only exasperated
them the more  and instantly they swore they would serve me as doctor
perkins had done  and they were going to lay violent hands on me  when
one of them  more humane than the rest  said that as i was a free man
they could not justify stripping me by law  i then immediately sent
for doctor brady  who was known to be an honest and worthy man  and on
his coming to my assistance they let me go 

this was not the only disagreeable incident i met with while i was in
this place  for  one day  while i was a little way out of the town of
savannah  i was beset by two white men  who meant to play their usual
tricks with me in the way of kidnapping  as soon as these men accosted
me  one of them said to the other   this is the very fellow we are
looking for that you lost   and the other swore immediately that i was
the identical person  on this they made up to me  and were about to
handle me  but i told them to be still and keep off  for i had seen
those kind of tricks played upon other free blacks  and they must not
think to serve me so  at this they paused a little  and one said to
the other  it will not do  and the other answered that i talked too
good english  i replied  i believed i did  and i had also with me a
revengeful stick equal to the occasion  and my mind was likewise good 
happily however it was not used  and  after we had talked together a
little in this manner  the rogues left me  i stayed in savannah some
time  anxiously trying to get to montserrat once more to see mr  king 
my old master  and then to take a final farewell of the american
quarter of the globe  at last i met with a sloop called the speedwell 
captain john bunton  which belonged to grenada  and was bound to
martinico  a french island  with a cargo of rice  and i shipped myself
on board of her  before i left georgia a black woman  who had a child
lying dead  being very tenacious of the church burial service  and not
able to get any white person to perform it  applied to me for that
purpose  i told her i was no parson  and besides  that the service
over the dead did not affect the soul  this however did not satisfy
her  she still urged me very hard  i therefore complied with her
earnest entreaties  and at last consented to act the parson for the
first time in my life  as she was much respected  there was a great
company both of white and black people at the grave  i then
accordingly assumed my new vocation  and performed the funeral
ceremony to the satisfaction of all present  after which i bade adieu
to georgia  and sailed for martinico 




chap  ix

      the author arrives at martinico  meets with new
     difficulties  gets to montserrat  where he takes leave of
     his old master  and sails for england  meets capt 
     pascal  learns the french horn  hires himself with doctor
     irving  where he learns to freshen sea water  leaves the
     doctor  and goes a voyage to turkey and portugal  and
     afterwards goes a voyage to grenada  and another to
     jamaica  returns to the doctor  and they embark together on
     a voyage to the north pole  with the hon  capt  phipps  some
     account of that voyage  and the dangers the author was
     in  he returns to england  


i thus took a final leave of georgia  for the treatment i had received
in it disgusted me very much against the place  and when i left it and
sailed for martinico i determined never more to revisit it  my new
captain conducted his vessel safer than my former one  and  after an
agreeable voyage  we got safe to our intended port  while i was on
this island i went about a good deal  and found it very pleasant  in
particular i admired the town of st  pierre  which is the principal
one in the island  and built more like an european town than any i had
seen in the west indies  in general also  slaves were better treated 
had more holidays  and looked better than those in the english
islands  after we had done our business here  i wanted my discharge 
which was necessary  for it was then the month of may  and i wished
much to be at montserrat to bid farewell to mr  king  and all my other
friends there  in time to sail for old england in the july fleet  but 
alas  i had put a great stumbling block in my own way  by which i was
near losing my passage that season to england  i had lent my captain
some money  which i now wanted to enable me to prosecute my
intentions  this i told him  but when i applied for it  though i urged
the necessity of my occasion  i met with so much shuffling from him 
that i began at last to be afraid of losing my money  as i could not
recover it by law  for i have already mentioned  that throughout the
west indies no black man s testimony is admitted  on any occasion 
against any white person whatever  and therefore my own oath would
have been of no use  i was obliged  therefore  to remain with him
till he might be disposed to return it to me  thus we sailed from
martinico for the grenades  i frequently pressing the captain for my
money to no purpose  and  to render my condition worse  when we got
there  the captain and his owners quarrelled  so that my situation
became daily more irksome  for besides that we on board had little or
no victuals allowed us  and i could not get my money nor wages  i
could then have gotten my passage free to montserrat had i been able
to accept it  the worst of all was  that it was growing late in july 
and the ships in the islands must sail by the   th of that month  at
last  however  with a great many entreaties  i got my money from the
captain  and took the first vessel i could meet with for st  eustatia 
from thence i went in another to basseterre in st  kitts  where i
arrived on the   th of july  on the   d  having met with a vessel
bound to montserrat  i wanted to go in her  but the captain and others
would not take me on board until i should advertise myself  and give
notice of my going off the island  i told them of my haste to be in
montserrat  and that the time then would not admit of advertising  it
being late in the evening  and the captain about to sail  but he
insisted it was necessary  and otherwise he said he would not take me 
this reduced me to great perplexity  for if i should be compelled to
submit to this degrading necessity  which every black freeman is
under  of advertising himself like a slave  when he leaves an island 
and which i thought a gross imposition upon any freeman  i feared i
should miss that opportunity of going to montserrat  and then i could
not get to england that year  the vessel was just going off  and no
time could be lost  i immediately therefore set about  with a heavy
heart  to try who i could get to befriend me in complying with the
demands of the captain  luckily i found  in a few minutes  some
gentlemen of montserrat whom i knew  and  having told them my
situation  i requested their friendly assistance in helping me off the
island  some of them  on this  went with me to the captain  and
satisfied him of my freedom  and  to my very great joy  he desired me
to go on board  we then set sail  and the next day  the   d  i arrived
at the wished for place  after an absence of six months  in which i
had more than once experienced the delivering hand of providence 
when all human means of escaping destruction seemed hopeless  i saw my
friends with a gladness of heart which was increased by my absence and
the dangers i had escaped  and i was received with great friendship by
them all  but particularly by mr  king  to whom i related the fate of
his sloop  the nancy  and the causes of her being wrecked  i now
learned with extreme sorrow  that his house was washed away during my
absence  by the bursting of a pond at the top of a mountain that was
opposite the town of plymouth  it swept great part of the town away 
and mr  king lost a great deal of property from the inundation  and
nearly his life  when i told him i intended to go to london that
season  and that i had come to visit him before my departure  the good
man expressed a great deal of affection for me  and sorrow that i
should leave him  and warmly advised me to stay there  insisting  as i
was much respected by all the gentlemen in the place  that i might do
very well  and in a short time have land and slaves of my own  i
thanked him for this instance of his friendship  but  as i wished very
much to be in london  i declined remaining any longer there  and
begged he would excuse me  i then requested he would be kind enough to
give me a certificate of my behaviour while in his service  which he
very readily complied with  and gave me the following 

                                      montserrat  january           

      the bearer hereof  gustavus vassa  was my slave for upwards
     of three years  during which he has always behaved himself
     well  and discharged his duty with honesty and assiduity 

                                                     robert king 

      to all whom this may concern  

having obtained this  i parted from my kind master  after many sincere
professions of gratitude and regard  and prepared for my departure for
london  i immediately agreed to go with one capt  john hamer  for
seven guineas  the passage to london  on board a ship called the
andromache  and on the   th and   th i had free dances  as they are
called  with some of my countrymen  previous to my setting off  after
which i took leave of all my friends  and on the   th i embarked for
london  exceedingly glad to see myself once more on board of a ship 
and still more so  in steering the course i had long wished for  with
a light heart i bade montserrat farewell  and never had my feet on it
since  and with it i bade adieu to the sound of the cruel whip  and
all other dreadful instruments of torture  adieu to the offensive
sight of the violated chastity of the sable females  which has too
often accosted my eyes  adieu to oppressions  although to me less
severe than most of my countrymen   and adieu to the angry howling 
dashing surfs  i wished for a grateful and thankful heart to praise
the lord god on high for all his mercies 

we had a most prosperous voyage  and  at the end of seven weeks 
arrived at cherry garden stairs  thus were my longing eyes once more
gratified with a sight of london  after having been absent from it
above four years  i immediately received my wages  and i never had
earned seven guineas so quick in my life before  i had thirty seven
guineas in all  when i got cleared of the ship  i now entered upon a
scene  quite new to me  but full of hope  in this situation my first
thoughts were to look out for some of my former friends  and amongst
the first of those were the miss guerins  as soon  therefore  as i had
regaled myself i went in quest of those kind ladies  whom i was very
impatient to see  and with some difficulty and perseverance  i found
them at may s hill  greenwich  they were most agreeably surprised to
see me  and i quite overjoyed at meeting with them  i told them my
history  at which they expressed great wonder  and freely acknowledged
it did their cousin  capt  pascal  no honour  he then visited there
frequently  and i met him four or five days after in greenwich park 
when he saw me he appeared a good deal surprised  and asked me how i
came back  i answered   in a ship   to which he replied dryly   i
suppose you did not walk back to london on the water   as i saw  by
his manner  that he did not seem to be sorry for his behaviour to me 
and that i had not much reason to expect any favour from him  i told
him that he had used me very ill  after i had been such a faithful
servant to him for so many years  on which  without saying any more 
he turned about and went away  a few days after this i met capt 
pascal at miss guerin s house  and asked him for my prize money  he
said there was none due to me  for  if my prize money had been
          he had a right to it all  i told him i was informed
otherwise  on which he bade me defiance  and  in a bantering tone 
desired me to commence a lawsuit against him for it   there are
lawyers enough   said he   that will take the cause in hand  and you
had better try it   i told him then that i would try it  which enraged
him very much  however  out of regard to the ladies  i remained still 
and never made any farther demand of my right  some time afterwards
these friendly ladies asked me what i meant to do with myself  and how
they could assist me  i thanked them  and said  if they pleased  i
would be their servant  but if not  as i had thirty seven guineas 
which would support me for some time  i would be much obliged to them
to recommend me to some person who would teach me a business whereby i
might earn my living  they answered me very politely  that they were
sorry it did not suit them to take me as their servant  and asked me
what business i should like to learn  i said  hair dressing  they then
promised to assist me in this  and soon after they recommended me to a
gentleman whom i had known before  one capt  o hara  who treated me
with much kindness  and procured me a master  a hair dresser  in
coventry court  haymarket  with whom he placed me  i was with this man
from september till the february following  in that time we had a
neighbour in the same court who taught the french horn  he used to
blow it so well that i was charmed with it  and agreed with him to
teach me to blow it  accordingly he took me in hand  and began to
instruct me  and i soon learned all the three parts  i took great
delight in blowing on this instrument  the evenings being long  and
besides that i was fond of it  i did not like to be idle  and it
filled up my vacant hours innocently  at this time also i agreed with
the rev  mr  gregory  who lived in the same court  where he kept an
academy and an evening school  to improve me in arithmetic  this he
did as far as barter and alligation  so that all the time i was there
i was entirely employed  in february      i hired myself to dr 
charles irving  in pall mall  so celebrated for his successful
experiments in making sea water fresh  and here i had plenty of
hair dressing to improve my hand  this gentleman was an excellent
master  he was exceedingly kind and good tempered  and allowed me in
the evenings to attend my schools  which i esteemed a great blessing 
therefore i thanked god and him for it  and used all my diligence to
improve the opportunity  this diligence and attention recommended me
to the notice and care of my three preceptors  who on their parts
bestowed a great deal of pains in my instruction  and besides were all
very kind to me  my wages  however  which were by two thirds less than
i ever had in my life  for i had only   l  per annum  i soon found
would not be sufficient to defray this extraordinary expense of
masters  and my own necessary expenses  my old thirty seven guineas
had by this time worn all away to one  i thought it best  therefore 
to try the sea again in quest of more money  as i had been bred to it 
and had hitherto found the profession of it successful  i had also a
very great desire to see turkey  and i now determined to gratify it 
accordingly  in the month of may        i told the doctor my wish to
go to sea again  to which he made no opposition  and we parted on
friendly terms  the same day i went into the city in quest of a
master  i was extremely fortunate in my inquiry  for i soon heard of a
gentleman who had a ship going to italy and turkey  and he wanted a
man who could dress hair well  i was overjoyed at this  and went
immediately on board of his ship  as i had been directed  which i
found to be fitted up with great taste  and i already foreboded no
small pleasure in sailing in her  not finding the gentleman on board 
i was directed to his lodgings  where i met with him the next day  and
gave him a specimen of my dressing  he liked it so well that he hired
me immediately  so that i was perfectly happy  for the ship  master 
and voyage  were entirely to my mind  the ship was called the delawar 
and my master s name was john jolly  a neat smart good humoured man 
just such an one as i wished to serve  we sailed from england in july
following  and our voyage was extremely pleasant  we went to villa
franca  nice  and leghorn  and in all these places i was charmed with
the richness and beauty of the countries  and struck with the elegant
buildings with which they abound  we had always in them plenty of
extraordinary good wines and rich fruits  which i was very fond of 
and i had frequent occasions of gratifying both my taste and
curiosity  for my captain always lodged on shore in those places 
which afforded me opportunities to see the country around  i also
learned navigation of the mate  which i was very fond of  when we left
italy we had delightful sailing among the archipelago islands  and
from thence to smyrna in turkey  this is a very ancient city  the
houses are built of stone  and most of them have graves adjoining to
them  so that they sometimes present the appearance of church yards 
provisions are very plentiful in this city  and good wine less than a
penny a pint  the grapes  pomegranates  and many other fruits  were
also the richest and largest i ever tasted  the natives are well
looking and strong made  and treated me always with great civility  in
general i believe they are fond of black people  and several of them
gave me pressing invitations to stay amongst them  although they keep
the franks  or christians  separate  and do not suffer them to dwell
immediately amongst them  i was astonished in not seeing women in any
of their shops  and very rarely any in the streets  and whenever i did
they were covered with a veil from head to foot  so that i could not
see their faces  except when any of them out of curiosity uncovered
them to look at me  which they sometimes did  i was surprised to see
how the greeks are  in some measure  kept under by the turks  as the
negroes are in the west indies by the white people  the less refined
greeks  as i have already hinted  dance here in the same manner as we
do in my nation  on the whole  during our stay here  which was about
five months  i liked the place and the turks extremely well  i could
not help observing one very remarkable circumstance there  the tails
of the sheep are flat  and so very large  that i have known the tail
even of a lamb to weigh from eleven to thirteen pounds  the fat of
them is very white and rich  and is excellent in puddings  for which
it is much used  our ship being at length richly loaded with silk  and
other articles  we sailed for england 

in may       soon after our return from turkey  our ship made a
delightful voyage to oporto in portugal  where we arrived at the time
of the carnival  on our arrival  there were sent on board to us
thirty six articles to observe  with very heavy penalties if we should
break any of them  and none of us even dared to go on board any other
vessel or on shore till the inquisition had sent on board and
searched for every thing illegal  especially bibles  such as were
produced  and certain other things  were sent on shore till the ships
were going away  and any person in whose custody a bible was found
concealed was to be imprisoned and flogged  and sent into slavery for
ten years  i saw here many very magnificent sights  particularly the
garden of eden  where many of the clergy and laity went in procession
in their several orders with the host  and sung te deum  i had a great
curiosity to go into some of their churches  but could not gain
admittance without using the necessary sprinkling of holy water at my
entrance  from curiosity  and a wish to be holy  i therefore complied
with this ceremony  but its virtues were lost on me  for i found
myself nothing the better for it  this place abounds with plenty of
all kinds of provisions  the town is well built and pretty  and
commands a fine prospect  our ship having taken in a load of wine  and
other commodities  we sailed for london  and arrived in july
following  our next voyage was to the mediterranean  the ship was
again got ready  and we sailed in september for genoa  this is one of
the finest cities i ever saw  some of the edifices were of beautiful
marble  and made a most noble appearance  and many had very curious
fountains before them  the churches were rich and magnificent  and
curiously adorned both in the inside and out  but all this grandeur
was in my eyes disgraced by the galley slaves  whose condition both
there and in other parts of italy is truly piteous and wretched  after
we had stayed there some weeks  during which we bought many different
things which we wanted  and got them very cheap  we sailed to naples 
a charming city  and remarkably clean  the bay is the most beautiful i
ever saw  the moles for shipping are excellent  i thought it
extraordinary to see grand operas acted here on sunday nights  and
even attended by their majesties  i too  like these great ones  went
to those sights  and vainly served god in the day while i thus served
mammon effectually at night  while we remained here there happened an
eruption of mount vesuvius  of which i had a perfect view  it was
extremely awful  and we were so near that the ashes from it used to be
thick on our deck  after we had transacted our business at naples we
sailed with a fair wind once more for smyrna  where we arrived in
december  a seraskier or officer took a liking to me here  and wanted
me to stay  and offered me two wives  however i refused the
temptation  the merchants here travel in caravans or large companies 
i have seen many caravans from india  with some hundreds of camels 
laden with different goods  the people of these caravans are quite
brown  among other articles  they brought with them a great quantity
of locusts  which are a kind of pulse  sweet and pleasant to the
palate  and in shape resembling french beans  but longer  each kind of
goods is sold in a street by itself  and i always found the turks very
honest in their dealings  they let no christians into their mosques or
churches  for which i was very sorry  as i was always fond of going to
see the different modes of worship of the people wherever i went  the
plague broke out while we were in smyrna  and we stopped taking goods
into the ship till it was over  she was then richly laden  and we
sailed in about march      for england  one day in our passage we met
with an accident which was near burning the ship  a black cook  in
melting some fat  overset the pan into the fire under the deck  which
immediately began to blaze  and the flame went up very high under the
foretop  with the fright the poor cook became almost white  and
altogether speechless  happily however we got the fire out without
doing much mischief  after various delays in this passage  which was
tedious  we arrived in standgate creek in july  and  at the latter end
of the year  some new event occurred  so that my noble captain  the
ship  and i all separated 

in april      i shipped myself as a steward with capt  wm  robertson
of the ship grenada planter  once more to try my fortune in the west
indies  and we sailed from london for madeira  barbadoes  and the
grenades  when we were at this last place  having some goods to sell 
i met once more with my former kind of west india customers  a white
man  an islander  bought some goods of me to the amount of some
pounds  and made me many fair promises as usual  but without any
intention of paying me  he had likewise bought goods from some more of
our people  whom he intended to serve in the same manner  but he still
amused us with promises  however  when our ship was loaded  and near
sailing  this honest buyer discovered no intention or sign of paying
for any thing he had bought of us  but on the contrary  when i asked
him for my money he threatened me and another black man he had bought
goods of  so that we found we were like to get more blows than
payment  on this we went to complain to one mr  m intosh  a justice of
the peace  we told his worship of the man s villainous tricks  and
begged that he would be kind enough to see us redressed  but being
negroes  although free  we could not get any remedy  and our ship
being then just upon the point of sailing  we knew not how to help
ourselves  though we thought it hard to lose our property in this
manner  luckily for us however  this man was also indebted to three
white sailors  who could not get a farthing from him  they therefore
readily joined us  and we all went together in search of him  when we
found where he was  i took him out of a house and threatened him with
vengeance  on which  finding he was likely to be handled roughly  the
rogue offered each of us some small allowance  but nothing near our
demands  this exasperated us much more  and some were for cutting his
ears off  but he begged hard for mercy  which was at last granted him 
after we had entirely stripped him  we then let him go  for which he
thanked us  glad to get off so easily  and ran into the bushes  after
having wished us a good voyage  we then repaired on board  and shortly
after set sail for england  i cannot help remarking here a very narrow
escape we had from being blown up  owing to a piece of negligence of
mine  just as our ship was under sail  i went down into the cabin to
do some business  and had a lighted candle in my hand  which  in my
hurry  without thinking  i held in a barrel of gunpowder  it remained
in the powder until it was near catching fire  when fortunately i
observed it and snatched it out in time  and providentially no harm
happened  but i was so overcome with terror that i immediately fainted
at this deliverance 

in twenty eight days time we arrived in england  and i got clear of
this ship  but  being still of a roving disposition  and desirous of
seeing as many different parts of the world as i could  i shipped
myself soon after  in the same year  as steward on board of a fine
large ship  called the jamaica  captain david watt  and we sailed from
england in december      for nevis and jamaica  i found jamaica to be
a very fine large island  well peopled  and the most considerable of
the west india islands  there was a vast number of negroes here  whom
i found as usual exceedingly imposed upon by the white people  and the
slaves punished as in the other islands  there are negroes whose
business it is to flog slaves  they go about to different people for
employment  and the usual pay is from one to four bits  i saw many
cruel punishments inflicted on the slaves in the short time i stayed
here  in particular i was present when a poor fellow was tied up and
kept hanging by the wrists at some distance from the ground  and then
some half hundred weights were fixed to his ancles  in which posture
he was flogged most unmercifully  there were also  as i heard  two
different masters noted for cruelty on the island  who had staked up
two negroes naked  and in two hours the vermin stung them to death  i
heard a gentleman i well knew tell my captain that he passed sentence
on a negro man to be burnt alive for attempting to poison an overseer 
i pass over numerous other instances  in order to relieve the reader
by a milder scene of roguery  before i had been long on the island 
one mr  smith at port morant bought goods of me to the amount of
twenty five pounds sterling  but when i demanded payment from him  he
was going each time to beat me  and threatened that he would put me in
goal  one time he would say i was going to set his house on fire  at
another he would swear i was going to run away with his slaves  i was
astonished at this usage from a person who was in the situation of a
gentleman  but i had no alternative  i was therefore obliged to
submit  when i came to kingston  i was surprised to see the number of
africans who were assembled together on sundays  particularly at a
large commodious place  called spring path  here each different nation
of africa meet and dance after the manner of their own country  they
still retain most of their native customs  they bury their dead  and
put victuals  pipes and tobacco  and other things  in the grave with
the corps  in the same manner as in africa  our ship having got her
loading we sailed for london  where we arrived in the august
following  on my return to london  i waited on my old and good master 
dr  irving  who made me an offer of his service again  being now tired
of the sea i gladly accepted it  i was very happy in living with this
gentleman once more  during which time we were daily employed in
reducing old neptune s dominions by purifying the briny element and
making it fresh  thus i went on till may       when i was roused by
the sound of fame  to seek new adventures  and to find  towards the
north pole  what our creator never intended we should  a passage to
india  an expedition was now fitting out to explore a north east
passage  conducted by the honourable john constantine phipps  since
lord mulgrave  in his majesty s sloop of war the race horse  my master
being anxious for the reputation of this adventure  we therefore
prepared every thing for our voyage  and i attended him on board the
race horse  the   th day of may       we proceeded to sheerness  where
we were joined by his majesty s sloop the carcass  commanded by
captain lutwidge  on the  th of june we sailed towards our destined
place  the pole  and on the   th of the same month we were off
shetland  on this day i had a great and unexpected deliverance from an
accident which was near blowing up the ship and destroying the crew 
which made me ever after during the voyage uncommonly cautious  the
ship was so filled that there was very little room on board for any
one  which placed me in a very aukward situation  i had resolved to
keep a journal of this singular and interesting voyage  and i had no
other place for this purpose but a little cabin  or the doctor s
store room  where i slept  this little place was stuffed with all
manner of combustibles  particularly with tow and aquafortis  and many
other dangerous things  unfortunately it happened in the evening as i
was writing my journal  that i had occasion to take the candle out of
the lanthorn  and a spark having touched a single thread of the tow 
all the rest caught the flame  and immediately the whole was in a
blaze  i saw nothing but present death before me  and expected to be
the first to perish in the flames  in a moment the alarm was spread 
and many people who were near ran to assist in putting out the fire 
all this time i was in the very midst of the flames  my shirt  and the
handkerchief on my neck  were burnt  and i was almost smothered with
the smoke  however  through god s mercy  as i was nearly giving up all
hopes  some people brought blankets and mattresses and threw them on
the flames  by which means in a short time the fire was put out  i was
severely reprimanded and menaced by such of the officers who knew it 
and strictly charged never more to go there with a light  and  indeed 
even my own fears made me give heed to this command for a little time 
but at last  not being able to write my journal in any other part of
the ship  i was tempted again to venture by stealth with a light in
the same cabin  though not without considerable fear and dread on my
mind  on the   th of june we began to use dr  irving s apparatus for
making salt water fresh  i used to attend the distillery  i frequently
purified from twenty six to forty gallons a day  the water thus
distilled was perfectly pure  well tasted  and free from salt  and was
used on various occasions on board the ship  on the   th of june 
being in lat      we made greenland  where i was surprised to see the
sun did not set  the weather now became extremely cold  and as we
sailed between north and east  which was our course  we saw many very
high and curious mountains of ice  and also a great number of very
large whales  which used to come close to our ship  and blow the water
up to a very great height in the air  one morning we had vast
quantities of sea horses about the ship  which neighed exactly like
any other horses  we fired some harpoon guns amongst them  in order to
take some  but we could not get any  the   th  the captain of a
greenland ship came on board  and told us of three ships that were
lost in the ice  however we still held on our course till july the
  th  when we were stopt by one compact impenetrable body of ice  we
ran along it from east to west above ten degrees  and on the   th we
got as far north as         and in    or    degrees east longitude
from london  on the   th and   th of july we saw one continued plain
of smooth unbroken ice  bounded only by the horizon  and we fastened
to a piece of ice that was eight yards eleven inches thick  we had
generally sunshine  and constant daylight  which gave cheerfulness and
novelty to the whole of this striking  grand  and uncommon scene  and 
to heighten it still more  the reflection of the sun from the ice gave
the clouds a most beautiful appearance  we killed many different
animals at this time  and among the rest nine bears  though they had
nothing in their paunches but water yet they were all very fat  we
used to decoy them to the ship sometimes by burning feathers or skins 
i thought them coarse eating  but some of the ship s company relished
them very much  some of our people once  in the boat  fired at and
wounded a sea horse  which dived immediately  and  in a little time
after  brought up with it a number of others  they all joined in an
attack upon the boat  and were with difficulty prevented from staving
or oversetting her  but a boat from the carcass having come to assist
ours  and joined it  they dispersed  after having wrested an oar from
one of the men  one of the ship s boats had before been attacked in
the same manner  but happily no harm was done  though we wounded
several of these animals we never got but one  we remained hereabouts
until the  st of august  when the two ships got completely fastened in
the ice  occasioned by the loose ice that set in from the sea  this
made our situation very dreadful and alarming  so that on the  th day
we were in very great apprehension of having the ships squeezed to
pieces  the officers now held a council to know what was best for us
to do in order to save our lives  and it was determined that we should
endeavour to escape by dragging our boats along the ice towards the
sea  which  however  was farther off than any of us thought  this
determination filled us with extreme dejection  and confounded us with
despair  for we had very little prospect of escaping with life 
however  we sawed some of the ice about the ships to keep it from
hurting them  and thus kept them in a kind of pond  we then began to
drag the boats as well as we could towards the sea  but  after two or
three days labour  we made very little progress  so that some of our
hearts totally failed us  and i really began to give up myself for
lost  when i saw our surrounding calamities  while we were at this
hard labour i once fell into a pond we had made amongst some loose
ice  and was very near being drowned  but providentially some people
were near who gave me immediate assistance  and thereby i escaped
drowning  our deplorable condition  which kept up the constant
apprehension of our perishing in the ice  brought me gradually to
think of eternity in such a manner as i never had done before  i had
the fears of death hourly upon me  and shuddered at the thoughts of
meeting the grim king of terrors in the  natural  state i then was in 
and was exceedingly doubtful of a happy eternity if i should die in
it  i had no hopes of my life being prolonged for any time  for we
saw that our existence could not be long on the ice after leaving the
ships  which were now out of sight  and some miles from the boats  our
appearance now became truly lamentable  pale dejection seized every
countenance  many  who had been before blasphemers  in this our
distress began to call on the good god of heaven for his help  and in
the time of our utter need he heard us  and against hope or human
probability delivered us  it was the eleventh day of the ships being
thus fastened  and the fourth of our drawing the boats in this manner 
that the wind changed to the e n e  the weather immediately became
mild  and the ice broke towards the sea  which was to the s w  of us 
many of us on this got on board again  and with all our might we hove
the ships into every open water we could find  and made all the sail
on them in our power  and now  having a prospect of success  we made
signals for the boats and the remainder of the people  this seemed to
us like a reprieve from death  and happy was the man who could first
get on board of any ship  or the first boat he could meet  we then
proceeded in this manner till we got into the open water again  which
we accomplished in about thirty hours  to our infinite joy and
gladness of heart  as soon as we were out of danger we came to anchor
and refitted  and on the   th of august we sailed from this
uninhabited extremity of the world  where the inhospitable climate
affords neither food nor shelter  and not a tree or shrub of any kind
grows amongst its barren rocks  but all is one desolate and expanded
waste of ice  which even the constant beams of the sun for six months
in the year cannot penetrate or dissolve  the sun now being on the
decline the days shortened as we sailed to the southward  and  on the
  th  in latitude     it was dark by ten o clock at night  september
the   th  in latitude        we met a very severe gale of wind and
high seas  and shipped a great deal of water in the space of ten
hours  this made us work exceedingly hard at all our pumps a whole
day  and one sea  which struck the ship with more force than any thing
i ever met with of the kind before  laid her under water for some
time  so that we thought she would have gone down  two boats were
washed from the booms  and the long boat from the chucks  all other
moveable things on the deck were also washed away  among which were
many curious things of different kinds which we had brought from
greenland  and we were obliged  in order to lighten the ship  to toss
some of our guns overboard  we saw a ship  at the same time  in very
great distress  and her masts were gone  but we were unable to assist
her  we now lost sight of the carcass till the   th  when we saw land
about orfordness  off which place she joined us  from thence we sailed
for london  and on the   th came up to deptford  and thus ended our
arctic voyage  to the no small joy of all on board  after having been
absent four months  in which time  at the imminent hazard of our
lives  we explored nearly as far towards the pole as    degrees north 
and    degrees east longitude  being much farther  by all accounts 
than any navigator had ever ventured before  in which we fully proved
the impracticability of finding a passage that way to india

     turkey ship  account of a black man s being kidnapped on
     board and sent to the west indies  and the author s
     fruitless endeavours to procure his freedom  some account of
     the manner of the author s conversion to the faith of jesus
     christ  


our voyage to the north pole being ended  i returned to london with
doctor irving  with whom i continued for some time  during which i
began seriously to reflect on the dangers i had escaped  particularly
those of my last voyage  which made a lasting impression on my mind 
and  by the grace of god  proved afterwards a mercy to me  it caused
me to reflect deeply on my eternal state  and to seek the lord with
full purpose of heart ere it was too late  i rejoiced greatly  and
heartily thanked the lord for directing me to london  where i was
determined to work out my own salvation  and in so doing procure a
title to heaven  being the result of a mind blended by ignorance and
sin 

in process of time i left my master  doctor irving  the purifier of
waters  and lodged in coventry court  haymarket  where i was
continually oppressed and much concerned about the salvation of my
soul  and was determined  in my own strength  to be a first rate
christian  i used every means for this purpose  and  not being able to
find any person amongst my acquaintance that agreed with me in point
of religion  or  in scripture language   that would shew me any good  
i was much dejected  and knew not where to seek relief  however  i
first frequented the neighbouring churches  st  james s  and others 
two or three times a day  for many weeks  still i came away
dissatisfied  something was wanting that i could not obtain  and i
really found more heartfelt relief in reading my bible at home than in
attending the church  and  being resolved to be saved  i pursued other
methods still  first i went among the quakers  where the word of god
was neither read or preached  so that i remained as much in the dark
as ever  i then searched into the roman catholic principles  but was
not in the least satisfied  at length i had recourse to the jews 
which availed me nothing  for the fear of eternity daily harassed my
mind  and i knew not where to seek shelter from the wrath to come 
however this was my conclusion  at all events  to read the four
evangelists  and whatever sect or party i found adhering thereto such
i would join  thus i went on heavily without any guide to direct me
the way that leadeth to eternal life  i asked different people
questions about the manner of going to heaven  and was told different
ways  here i was much staggered  and could not find any at that time
more righteous than myself  or indeed so much inclined to devotion  i
thought we should not all be saved  this is agreeable to the holy
scriptures   nor would all be damned  i found none among the circle of
my acquaintance that kept wholly the ten commandments  so righteous
was i in my own eyes  that i was convinced i excelled many of them in
that point  by keeping eight out of ten  and finding those who in
general termed themselves christians not so honest or so good in their
morals as the turks  i really thought the turks were in a safer way of
salvation than my neighbours  so that between hopes and fears i went
on  and the chief comforts i enjoyed were in the musical french horn 
which i then practised  and also dressing of hair  such was my
situation some months  experiencing the dishonesty of many people
here  i determined at last to set out for turkey  and there to end my
days  it was now early in the spring       i sought for a master  and
found a captain john hughes  commander of a ship called anglicania 
fitting out in the river thames  and bound to smyrna in turkey  i
shipped myself with him as a steward  at the same time i recommended
to him a very clever black man  john annis  as a cook  this man was on
board the ship near two months doing his duty  he had formerly lived
many years with mr  william kirkpatrick  a gentleman of the island of
st  kitts  from whom he parted by consent  though he afterwards tried
many schemes to inveigle the poor man  he had applied to many captains
who traded to st  kitts to trepan him  and when all their attempts and
schemes of kidnapping proved abortive  mr  kirkpatrick came to our
ship at union stairs on easter monday  april the fourth  with two
wherry boats and six men  having learned that the man was on board 
and tied  and forcibly took him away from the ship  in the presence
of the crew and the chief mate  who had detained him after he had
notice to come away  i believe that this was a combined piece of
business  but  at any rate  it certainly reflected great disgrace on
the mate and captain also  who  although they had desired the
oppressed man to stay on board  yet he did not in the least assist to
recover him  or pay me a farthing of his wages  which was about five
pounds  i proved the only friend he had  who attempted to regain him
his liberty if possible  having known the want of liberty myself  i
sent as soon as i could to gravesend  and got knowledge of the ship in
which he was  but unluckily she had sailed the first tide after he was
put on board  my intention was then immediately to apprehend mr 
kirkpatrick  who was about setting off for scotland  and  having
obtained a  habeas corpus  for him  and got a tipstaff to go with me
to st  paul s church yard  where he lived  he  suspecting something of
this kind  set a watch to look out  my being known to them occasioned
me to use the following deception  i whitened my face  that they might
not know me  and this had its desired effect  he did not go out of his
house that night  and next morning i contrived a well plotted
stratagem notwithstanding he had a gentleman in his house to personate
him  my direction to the tipstaff  who got admittance into the house 
was to conduct him to a judge  according to the writ  when he came
there  his plea was  that he had not the body in custody  on which he
was admitted to bail  i proceeded immediately to that philanthropist 
granville sharp  esq  who received me with the utmost kindness  and
gave me every instruction that was needful on the occasion  i left him
in full hope that i should gain the unhappy man his liberty  with the
warmest sense of gratitude towards mr  sharp for his kindness  but 
alas  my attorney proved unfaithful  he took my money  lost me many
months employ  and did not do the least good in the cause  and when
the poor man arrived at st  kitts  he was  according to custom  staked
to the ground with four pins through a cord  two on his wrists  and
two on his ancles  was cut and flogged most unmercifully  and
afterwards loaded cruelly with irons about his neck  i had two very
moving letters from him  while he was in this situation  and also was
told of it by some very respectable families now in london  who saw
him in st  kitts  in the same state in which he remained till kind
death released him out of the hands of his tyrants  during this
disagreeable business i was under strong convictions of sin  and
thought that my state was worse than any man s  my mind was
unaccountably disturbed  i often wished for death  though at the same
time convinced i was altogether unprepared for that awful summons 
suffering much by villains in the late cause  and being much concerned
about the state of my soul  these things  but particularly the latter 
brought me very low  so that i became a burden to myself  and viewed
all things around me as emptiness and vanity  which could give no
satisfaction to a troubled conscience  i was again determined to go to
turkey  and resolved  at that time  never more to return to england  i
engaged as steward on board a turkeyman  the wester hall  capt 
linna   but was prevented by means of my late captain  mr  hughes  and
others  all this appeared to be against me  and the only comfort i
then experienced was  in reading the holy scriptures  where i saw that
 there is no new thing under the sun   eccles  i     and what was
appointed for me i must submit to  thus i continued to travel in much
heaviness  and frequently murmured against the almighty  particularly
in his providential dealings  and  awful to think  i began to
blaspheme  and wished often to be any thing but a human being  in
these severe conflicts the lord answered me by awful  visions of the
night  when deep sleep falleth upon men  in slumberings upon the bed  
job xxxiii      he was pleased  in much mercy  to give me to see  and
in some measure to understand  the great and awful scene of the
judgment day  that  no unclean person  no unholy thing  can enter into
the kingdom of god   eph  v     i would then  if it had been possible 
have changed my nature with the meanest worm on the earth  and was
ready to say to the mountains and rocks  fall on me   rev  vi      but
all in vain  i then requested the divine creator that he would grant
me a small space of time to repent of my follies and vile iniquities 
which i felt were grievous  the lord  in his manifold mercies  was
pleased to grant my request  and being yet in a state of time  the
sense of god s mercies was so great on my mind when i awoke  that my
strength entirely failed me for many minutes  and i was exceedingly
weak  this was the first spiritual mercy i ever was sensible of  and
being on praying ground  as soon as i recovered a little strength  and
got out of bed and dressed myself  i invoked heaven from my inmost
soul  and fervently begged that god would never again permit me to
blaspheme his most holy name  the lord  who is long suffering  and
full of compassion to such poor rebels as we are  condescended to hear
and answer  i felt that i was altogether unholy  and saw clearly what
a bad use i had made of the faculties i was endowed with  they were
given me to glorify god with  i thought  therefore  i had better want
them here  and enter into life eternal  than abuse them and be cast
into hell fire  i prayed to be directed  if there were any holier than
those with whom i was acquainted  that the lord would point them out
to me  i appealed to the searcher of hearts  whether i did not wish to
love him more  and serve him better  notwithstanding all this  the
reader may easily discern  if he is a believer  that i was still in
nature s darkness  at length i hated the house in which i lodged 
because god s most holy name was blasphemed in it  then i saw the word
of god verified  viz   before they call  i will answer  and while they
are yet speaking  i will hear  

i had a great desire to read the bible the whole day at home  but not
having a convenient place for retirement  i left the house in the day 
rather than stay amongst the wicked ones  and that day as i was
walking  it pleased god to direct me to a house where there was an old
sea faring man  who experienced much of the love of god shed abroad in
his heart  he began to discourse with me  and  as i desired to love
the lord  his conversation rejoiced me greatly  and indeed i had never
heard before the love of christ to believers set forth in such a
manner  and in so clear a point of view  here i had more questions to
put to the man than his time would permit him to answer  and in that
memorable hour there came in a dissenting minister  he joined our
discourse  and asked me some few questions  among others  where i
heard the gospel preached  i knew not what he meant by hearing the
gospel  i told him i had read the gospel  and he asked where i went to
church  or whether i went at all or not  to which i replied   i
attended st  james s  st  martin s  and st  ann s  soho     so   said
he   you are a churchman   i answered  i was  he then invited me to a
love feast at his chapel that evening  i accepted the offer  and
thanked him  and soon after he went away  i had some further discourse
with the old christian  added to some profitable reading  which made
me exceedingly happy  when i left him he reminded me of coming to the
feast  i assured him i would be there  thus we parted  and i weighed
over the heavenly conversation that had passed between these two men 
which cheered my then heavy and drooping spirit more than any thing i
had met with for many months  however  i thought the time long in
going to my supposed banquet  i also wished much for the company of
these friendly men  their company pleased me much  and i thought the
gentlemen very kind  in asking me  a stranger  to a feast  but how
singular did it appear to me  to have it in a chapel  when the
wished for hour came i went  and happily the old man was there  who
kindly seated me  as he belonged to the place  i was much astonished
to see the place filled with people  and no signs of eating and
drinking  there were many ministers in the company  at last they began
by giving out hymns  and between the singing the minister engaged in
prayer  in short  i knew not what to make of this sight  having never
seen any thing of the kind in my life before now  some of the guests
began to speak their experience  agreeable to what i read in the
scriptures  much was said by every speaker of the providence of god 
and his unspeakable mercies  to each of them  this i knew in a great
measure  and could most heartily join them  but when they spoke of a
future state  they seemed to be altogether certain of their calling
and election of god  and that no one could ever separate them from the
love of christ  or pluck them out of his hands  this filled me with
utter consternation  intermingled with admiration  i was so amazed as
not to know what to think of the company  my heart was attracted and
my affections were enlarged  i wished to be as happy as them  and was
persuaded in my mind that they were different from the world  that
lieth in wickedness     john v      their language and singing   c 
did well harmonize  i was entirely overcome  and wished to live and
die thus  lastly  some persons in the place produced some neat baskets
full of buns  which they distributed about  and each person
communicated with his neighbour  and sipped water out of different
mugs  which they handed about to all who were present  this kind of
christian fellowship i had never seen  nor ever thought of seeing on
earth  it fully reminded me of what i had read in the holy scriptures 
of the primitive christians  who loved each other and broke bread  in
partaking of it  even from house to house  this entertainment  which
lasted about four hours  ended in singing and prayer  it was the first
soul feast i ever was present at  this last twenty four hours produced
me things  spiritual and temporal  sleeping and waking  judgment and
mercy  that i could not but admire the goodness of god  in directing
the blind  blasphemous sinner in the path that he knew not of  even
among the just  and instead of judgment he has shewed mercy  and will
hear and answer the prayers and supplications of every returning
prodigal 

    o  to grace how great a debtor
    daily i m constrain d to be 

after this i was resolved to win heaven if possible  and if i perished
i thought it should be at the feet of jesus  in praying to him for
salvation  after having been an eye witness to some of the happiness
which attended those who feared god  i knew not how  with any
propriety  to return to my lodgings  where the name of god was
continually profaned  at which i felt the greatest horror  i paused in
my mind for some time  not knowing what to do  whether to hire a bed
elsewhere  or go home again  at last  fearing an evil report might
arise  i went home  with a farewell to card playing and vain jesting 
 c  i saw that time was very short  eternity long  and very near  and
i viewed those persons alone blessed who were found ready at midnight
call  or when the judge of all  both quick and dead  cometh 

the next day i took courage  and went to holborn  to see my new and
worthy acquaintance  the old man  mr  c      he  with his wife  a
gracious woman  were at work at silk weaving  they seemed mutually
happy  and both quite glad to see me  and i more so to see them  i sat
down  and we conversed much about soul matters   c  their discourse
was amazingly delightful  edifying  and pleasant  i knew not at last
how to leave this agreeable pair  till time summoned me away  as i
was going they lent me a little book  entitled  the conversion of an
indian   it was in questions and answers  the poor man came over the
sea to london  to inquire after the christian s god  who   through
rich mercy  he found  and had not his journey in vain  the above book
was of great use to me  and at that time was a means of strengthening
my faith  however  in parting  they both invited me to call on them
when i pleased  this delighted me  and i took care to make all the
improvement from it i could  and so far i thanked god for such company
and desires  i prayed that the many evils i felt within might be done
away  and that i might be weaned from my former carnal acquaintances 
this was quickly heard and answered  and i was soon connected with
those whom the scripture calls the excellent of the earth  i heard the
gospel preached  and the thoughts of my heart and actions were laid
open by the preachers  and the way of salvation by christ alone was
evidently set forth  thus i went on happily for near two months  and i
once heard  during this period  a reverend gentleman speak of a man
who had departed this life in full assurance of his going to glory  i
was much astonished at the assertion  and did very deliberately
inquire how he could get at this knowledge  i was answered fully 
agreeable to what i read in the oracles of truth  and was told also 
that if i did not experience the new birth  and the pardon of my sins 
through the blood of christ  before i died  i could not enter the
kingdom of heaven  i knew not what to think of this report  as i
thought i kept eight commandments out of ten  then my worthy
interpreter told me i did not do it  nor could i  and he added  that
no man ever did or could keep the commandments  without offending in
one point  i thought this sounded very strange  and puzzled me much
for many weeks  for i thought it a hard saying  i then asked my
friend  mr  l    d  who was a clerk in a chapel  why the commandments
of god were given  if we could not be saved by them  to which he
replied   the law is a schoolmaster to bring us to christ   who alone
could and did keep the commandments  and fulfilled all their
requirements for his elect people  even those to whom he had given a
living faith  and the sins of those chosen vessels  were already 
atoned for and forgiven them whilst living  and if i did not
experience the same before my exit  the lord would say at that great
day to me  go ye cursed    c   c  for god would appear faithful in his
judgments to the wicked  as he would be faithful in shewing mercy to
those who were ordained to it before the world was  therefore christ
jesus seemed to be all in all to that man s soul  i was much wounded
at this discourse  and brought into such a dilemma as i never
expected  i asked him  if  he  was to die that moment  whether he was
sure to enter the kingdom of god  and added   do you  know  that your
sins are forgiven you   he answered in the affirmative  then
confusion  anger  and discontent seized me  and i staggered much at
this sort of doctrine  it brought me to a stand  not knowing which to
believe  whether salvation by works or by faith only in christ  i
requested him to tell me how i might know when my sins were forgiven
me  he assured me he could not  and that none but god alone could do
this  i told him it was very mysterious  but he said it was really
matter of fact  and quoted many portions of scripture immediately to
the point  to which i could make no reply  he then desired me to pray
to god to shew me these things  i answered  that i prayed to god every
day  he said   i perceive you are a churchman   i answered i was  he
then entreated me to beg of god to shew me what i was  and the true
state of my soul  i thought the prayer very short and odd  so we
parted for that time  i weighed all these things well over  and could
not help thinking how it was possible for a man to know that his sins
were forgiven him in this life  i wished that god would reveal this
self same thing unto me  in a short time after this i went to
westminster chapel  the rev  mr  p     preached  from lam  iii      it
was a wonderful sermon  he clearly shewed that a living man had no
cause to complain for the punishment of his sins  he evidently
justified the lord in all his dealings with the sons of men  he also
shewed the justice of god in the eternal punishment of the wicked and
impenitent  the discourse seemed to me like a two edged sword cutting
all ways  it afforded me much joy  intermingled with many fears  about
my soul  and when it was ended  he gave it out that he intended  the
ensuing week  to examine all those who meant to attend the lord s
table  now i thought much of my good works  and at the same time was
doubtful of my being a proper object to receive the sacrament  i was
full of meditation till the day of examining  however  i went to the
chapel  and  though much distressed  i addressed the reverend
gentleman  thinking  if i was not right  he would endeavour to
convince me of it  when i conversed with him  the first thing he asked
me was  what i knew of christ  i told him i believed in him  and had
been baptized in his name   then   said he   when were you brought to
the knowledge of god  and how were you convinced of sin   i knew not
what he meant by these questions  i told him i kept eight commandments
out of ten  but that i sometimes swore on board ship  and sometimes
when on shore  and broke the sabbath  he then asked me if i could
read  i answered   yes     then   said he   do you not read in the
bible  he that offends in one point is guilty of all   i said   yes  
then he assured me  that one sin unatoned for was as sufficient to
damn a soul as one leak was to sink a ship  here i was struck with
awe  for the minister exhorted me much  and reminded me of the
shortness of time  and the length of eternity  and that no
unregenerate soul  or any thing unclean  could enter the kingdom of
heaven  he did not admit me as a communicant  but recommended me to
read the scriptures  and hear the word preached  not to neglect
fervent prayer to god  who has promised to hear the supplications of
those who seek him in godly sincerity  so i took my leave of him  with
many thanks  and resolved to follow his advice  so far as the lord
would condescend to enable me  during this time i was out of employ 
nor was i likely to get a situation suitable for me  which obliged me
to go once more to sea  i engaged as steward of a ship called the
hope  capt  richard strange  bound from london to cadiz in spain  in a
short time after i was on board i heard the name of god much
blasphemed  and i feared greatly  lest i should catch the horrible
infection  i thought if i sinned again  after having life and death
set evidently before me  i should certainly go to hell  my mind was
uncommonly chagrined  and i murmured much at god s providential
dealings with me  and was discontented with the commandments  that i
could not be saved by what i had done  i hated all things  and wished
i had never been born  confusion seized me  and i wished to be
annihilated  one day i was standing on the very edge of the stern of
the ship  thinking to drown myself  but this scripture was instantly
impressed on my mind   that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in
him     john iii      then i paused  and thought myself the unhappiest
man living  again i was convinced that the lord was better to me than
i deserved  and i was better off in the world than many  after this i
began to fear death  i fretted  mourned  and prayed  till i became a
burden to others  but more so to myself  at length i concluded to beg
my bread on shore rather than go again to sea amongst a people who
feared not god  and i entreated the captain three different times to
discharge me  he would not  but each time gave me greater and greater
encouragement to continue with him  and all on board shewed me very
great civility  notwithstanding all this i was unwilling to embark
again  at last some of my religious friends advised me  by saying it
was my lawful calling  consequently it was my duty to obey  and that
god was not confined to place   c   c  particularly mr  g s  the
governor of tothil fields bridewell  who pitied my case  and read the
eleventh chapter of the hebrews to me  with exhortations  he prayed
for me  and i believed that he prevailed on my behalf  as my burden
was then greatly removed  and i found a heartfelt resignation to the
will of god  the good man gave me a pocket bible and allen s alarm to
the unconverted  we parted  and the next day i went on board again  we
sailed for spain  and i found favour with the captain  it was the
fourth of the month of september when we sailed from london  we had a
delightful voyage to cadiz  where we arrived the twenty third of the
same month  the place is strong  commands a fine prospect  and is very
rich  the spanish galloons frequent that port  and some arrived whilst
we were there  i had many opportunities of reading the scriptures  i
wrestled hard with god in fervent prayer  who had declared in his word
that he would hear the groanings and deep sighs of the poor in spirit 
i found this verified to my utter astonishment and comfort in the
following manner 

on the morning of the  th of october   i pray you to attend  or all
that day  i thought that i should either see or hear something
supernatural  i had a secret impulse on my mind of something that was
to take place  which drove me continually for that time to a throne of
grace  it pleased god to enable me to wrestle with him  as jacob did 
i prayed that if sudden death were to happen  and i perished  it might
be at christ s feet 

in the evening of the same day  as i was reading and meditating on the
fourth chapter of the acts  twelfth verse  under the solemn
apprehensions of eternity  and reflecting on my past actions  i began
to think i had lived a moral life  and that i had a proper ground to
believe i had an interest in the divine favour  but still meditating
on the subject  not knowing whether salvation was to be had partly for
our own good deeds  or solely as the sovereign gift of god  in this
deep consternation the lord was pleased to break in upon my soul with
his bright beams of heavenly light  and in an instant as it were 
removing the veil  and letting light into a dark place  i saw clearly
with the eye of faith the crucified saviour bleeding on the cross on
mount calvary  the scriptures became an unsealed book  i saw myself a
condemned criminal under the law  which came with its full force to my
conscience  and when  the commandment came sin revived  and i died   i
saw the lord jesus christ in his humiliation  loaded and bearing my
reproach  sin  and shame  i then clearly perceived that by the deeds
of the law no flesh living could be justified  i was then convinced
that by the first adam sin came  and by the second adam  the lord
jesus christ  all that are saved must be made alive  it was given me
at that time to know what it was to be born again  john iii     i saw
the eighth chapter to the romans  and the doctrines of god s decrees 
verified agreeable to his eternal  everlasting  and unchangeable
purposes  the word of god was sweet to my taste  yea sweeter than
honey and the honeycomb  christ was revealed to my soul as the
chiefest among ten thousand  these heavenly moments were really as
life to the dead  and what john calls an earnest of the spirit v  
this was indeed unspeakable  and i firmly believe undeniable by many 
now every leading providential circumstance that happened to me  from
the day i was taken from my parents to that hour  was then in my view 
as if it had but just then occurred  i was sensible of the invisible
hand of god  which guided and protected me when in truth i knew it
not  still the lord pursued me although i slighted and disregarded it 
this mercy melted me down  when i considered my poor wretched state i
wept  seeing what a great debtor i was to sovereign free grace  now
the ethiopian was willing to be saved by jesus christ  the sinner s
only surety  and also to rely on none other person or thing for
salvation  self was obnoxious  and good works he had none  for it is
god that worketh in us both to will and to do  the amazing things of
that hour can never be told  it was joy in the holy ghost  i felt an
astonishing change  the burden of sin  the gaping jaws of hell  and
the fears of death  that weighed me down before  now lost their
horror  indeed i thought death would now be the best earthly friend i
ever had  such were my grief and joy as i believe are seldom
experienced  i was bathed in tears  and said  what am i that god
should thus look on me the vilest of sinners  i felt a deep concern
for my mother and friends  which occasioned me to pray with fresh
ardour  and  in the abyss of thought  i viewed the unconverted people
of the world in a very awful state  being without god and without
hope 

it pleased god to pour out on me the spirit of prayer and the grace of
supplication  so that in loud acclamations i was enabled to praise and
glorify his most holy name  when i got out of the cabin  and told some
of the people what the lord had done for me  alas  who could
understand me or believe my report   none but to whom the arm of the
lord was revealed  i became a barbarian to them in talking of the love
of christ  his name was to me as ointment poured forth  indeed it was
sweet to my soul  but to them a rock of offence  i thought my case
singular  and every hour a day until i came to london  for i much
longed to be with some to whom i could tell of the wonders of god s
love towards me  and join in prayer to him whom my soul loved and
thirsted after  i had uncommon commotions within  such as few can tell
aught about  now the bible was my only companion and comfort  i prized
it much  with many thanks to god that i could read it for myself  and
was not left to be tossed about or led by man s devices and notions 
the worth of a soul cannot be told   may the lord give the reader an
understanding in this  whenever i looked in the bible i saw things
new  and many texts were immediately applied to me with great comfort 
for i knew that to me was the word of salvation sent  sure i was that
the spirit which indited the word opened my heart to receive the truth
of it as it is in jesus  that the same spirit enabled me to act faith
upon the promises that were so precious to me  and enabled me to
believe to the salvation of my soul  by free grace i was persuaded
that i had a part in the first resurrection  and was  enlightened with
the light of the living   job xxxiii      i wished for a man of god
with whom i might converse  my soul was like the chariots of aminidab 
canticles vi      these  among others  were the precious promises that
were so powerfully applied to me   all things whatsoever ye shall ask
in prayer  believing  ye shall receive   mat  xxi       peace i leave
with you  my peace i give unto you   john xiv      i saw the blessed
redeemer to be the fountain of life  and the well of salvation  i
experienced him all in all  he had brought me by a way that i knew
not  and he had made crooked paths straight  then in his name i set up
my ebenezer  saying  hitherto he hath helped me  and could say to the
sinners about me  behold what a saviour i have  thus i was  by the
teaching of that all glorious deity  the great one in three  and three
in one  confirmed in the truths of the bible  those oracles of
everlasting truth  on which every soul living must stand or fall
eternally  agreeable to acts iv       neither is there salvation in
any other  for there is none other name under heaven given among men
whereby we must be saved  but only christ jesus   may god give the
reader a right understanding in these facts  to him that believeth all
things are possible  but to them that are unbelieving nothing is pure 
titus i      during this period we remained at cadiz until our ship
got laden  we sailed about the fourth of november  and  having a good
passage  we arrived in london the month following  to my comfort  with
heartfelt gratitude to god for his rich and unspeakable mercies  on my
return i had but one text which puzzled me  or that the devil
endeavoured to buffet me with  viz  rom  xi     and  as i had heard of
the reverend mr  romaine  and his great knowledge in the scriptures  i
wished much to hear him preach  one day i went to blackfriars church 
and  to my great satisfaction and surprise  he preached from that very
text  he very clearly shewed the difference between human works and
free election  which is according to god s sovereign will and
pleasure  these glad tidings set me entirely at liberty  and i went
out of the church rejoicing  seeing my spots were those of god s
children  i went to westminster chapel  and saw some of my old
friends  who were glad when they perceived the wonderful change that
the lord had wrought in me  particularly mr  g     s      my worthy
acquaintance  who was a man of a choice spirit  and had great zeal for
the lord s service  i enjoyed his correspondence till he died in the
year       i was again examined at that same chapel  and was received
into church fellowship amongst them  i rejoiced in spirit  making
melody in my heart to the god of all my mercies  now my whole wish was
to be dissolved  and to be with christ  but  alas  i must wait mine
appointed time

when our ship was got ready for sea again  i was entreated by the
captain to go in her once more  but  as i felt myself now as happy as
i could wish to be in this life  i for some time refused  however  the
advice of my friends at last prevailed  and  in full resignation to
the will of god  i again embarked for cadiz in march       we had a
very good passage  without any material accident  until we arrived off
the bay of cadiz  when one sunday  just as we were going into the
harbour  the ship struck against a rock and knocked off a garboard
plank  which is the next to the keel  in an instant all hands were in
the greatest confusion  and began with loud cries to call on god to
have mercy on them  although i could not swim  and saw no way of
escaping death  i felt no dread in my then situation  having no desire
to live  i even rejoiced in spirit  thinking this death would be
sudden glory  but the fulness of time was not yet come  the people
near to me were much astonished in seeing me thus calm and resigned 
but i told them of the peace of god  which through sovereign grace i
enjoyed  and these words were that instant in my mind 

     christ is my pilot wise  my compass is his word 
    my soul each storm defies  while i have such a lord 
      i trust his faithfulness and power 
      to save me in the trying hour 
    though rocks and quicksands deep through all my passage lie 
    yet christ shall safely keep and guide me with his eye 
      how can i sink with such a prop 
      that bears the world and all things up  

at this time there were many large spanish flukers or passage vessels
full of people crossing the channel  who seeing our condition  a
number of them came alongside of us  as many hands as could be
employed began to work  some at our three pumps  and the rest
unloading the ship as fast as possible  there being only a single rock
called the porpus on which we struck  we soon got off it  and
providentially it was then high water  we therefore run the ship
ashore at the nearest place to keep her from sinking  after many
tides  with a great deal of care and industry  we got her repaired
again  when we had dispatched our business at cadiz  we went to
gibraltar  and from thence to malaga  a very pleasant and rich city 
where there is one of the finest cathedrals i had ever seen  it had
been above fifty years in building  as i heard  though it was not then
quite finished  great part of the inside  however  was completed and
highly decorated with the richest marble columns and many superb
paintings  it was lighted occasionally by an amazing number of wax
tapers of different sizes  some of which were as thick as a man s
thigh  these  however  were only used on some of their grand
festivals 

i was very much shocked at the custom of bull baiting  and other
diversions which prevailed here on sunday evenings  to the great
scandal of christianity and morals  i used to express my abhorrence of
it to a priest whom i met with  i had frequent contests about religion
with the reverend father  in which he took great pains to make a
proselyte of me to his church  and i no less to convert him to mine 
on these occasions i used to produce my bible  and shew him in what
points his church erred  he then said he had been in england  and that
every person there read the bible  which was very wrong  but i
answered him that christ desired us to search the scriptures  in his
zeal for my conversion  he solicited me to go to one of the
universities in spain  and declared that i should have my education
free  and told me  if i got myself made a priest  i might in time
become even pope  and that pope benedict was a black man  as i was
ever desirous of learning  i paused for some time upon this
temptation  and thought by being crafty i might catch some with guile 
but i began to think that it would be only hypocrisy in me to embrace
his offer  as i could not in conscience conform to the opinions of his
church  i was therefore enabled to regard the word of god  which says 
 come out from amongst them   and refused father vincent s offer  so
we parted without conviction on either side 

having taken at this place some fine wines  fruits  and money  we
proceeded to cadiz  where we took about two tons more of money   c 
and then sailed for england in the month of june  when we were about
the north latitude     we had contrary wind for several days  and the
ship did not make in that time above six or seven miles straight
course  this made the captain exceeding fretful and peevish  and i was
very sorry to hear god s most holy name often blasphemed by him  one
day  as he was in that impious mood  a young gentleman on board  who
was a passenger  reproached him  and said he acted wrong  for we ought
to be thankful to god for all things  as we were not in want of any
thing on board  and though the wind was contrary for us  yet it was
fair for some others  who  perhaps  stood in more need of it than we 
i immediately seconded this young gentleman with some boldness  and
said we had not the least cause to murmur  for that the lord was
better to us than we deserved  and that he had done all things well  i
expected that the captain would be very angry with me for speaking 
but he replied not a word  however  before that time on the following
day  being the   st of june  much to our great joy and astonishment 
we saw the providential hand of our benign creator  whose ways with
his blind creatures are past finding out  the preceding night i
dreamed that i saw a boat immediately off the starboard main shrouds 
and exactly at half past one o clock  the following day at noon  while
i was below  just as we had dined in the cabin  the man at the helm
cried out  a boat  which brought my dream that instant into my mind  i
was the first man that jumped on the deck  and  looking from the
shrouds onward  according to my dream  i descried a little boat at
some distance  but  as the waves were high  it was as much as we could
do sometimes to discern her  we however stopped the ship s way  and
the boat  which was extremely small  came alongside with eleven
miserable men  whom we took on board immediately  to all human
appearance  these people must have perished in the course of one hour
or less  the boat being small  it barely contained them  when we took
them up they were half drowned  and had no victuals  compass  water 
or any other necessary whatsoever  and had only one bit of an oar to
steer with  and that right before the wind  so that they were obliged
to trust entirely to the mercy of the waves  as soon as we got them
all on board  they bowed themselves on their knees  and  with hands
and voices lifted up to heaven  thanked god for their deliverance  and
i trust that my prayers were not wanting amongst them at the same
time  this mercy of the lord quite melted me  and i recollected his
words  which i saw thus verified in the    th psalm  o give thanks
unto the lord  for he is good  for his mercy endureth for ever  hungry
and thirsty  their souls fainted in them  they cried unto lord in
their trouble  and he delivered them out of their distresses  and he
led them forth by the right way  that they might go to a city of
habitation  o that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for
his wonderful works to the children of men  for he satisfieth the
longing soul  and filleth the hungry soul with goodness 

 such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death 

 then they cried unto the lord in their trouble  and he saved them out
of their distresses  they that go down to the sea in ships  that do
business in great waters  these see the works of the lord  and his
wonders in the deep  whoso is wise and will observe these things  even
they shall understand the loving kindness of the lord  

the poor distressed captain said   that the lord is good  for  seeing
that i am not fit to die  he therefore gave me a space of time to
repent   i was very glad to hear this expression  and took an
opportunity when convenient of talking to him on the providence of
god  they told us they were portuguese  and were in a brig loaded with
corn  which shifted that morning at five o clock  owing to which the
vessel sunk that instant with two of the crew  and how these eleven
got into the boat  which was lashed to the deck  not one of them could
tell  we provided them with every necessary  and brought them all safe
to london  and i hope the lord gave them repentance unto life eternal 

i was happy once more amongst my friends and brethren  till november 
when my old friend  the celebrated doctor irving  bought a remarkable
fine sloop  about     tons  he had a mind for a new adventure in
cultivating a plantation at jamaica and the musquito shore  asked me
to go with him  and said that he would trust me with his estate in
preference to any one  by the advice  therefore  of my friends  i
accepted of the offer  knowing that the harvest was fully ripe in
those parts  and hoped to be the instrument  under god  of bringing
some poor sinner to my well beloved master  jesus christ  before i
embarked  i found with the doctor four musquito indians  who were
chiefs in their own country  and were brought here by some english
traders for some selfish ends  one of them was the musquito king s
son  a youth of about eighteen years of age  and whilst he was here he
was baptized by the name of george  they were going back at the
government s expense  after having been in england about twelve
months  during which they learned to speak pretty good english  when i
came to talk to them about eight days before we sailed  i was very
much mortified in finding that they had not frequented any churches
since they were here  to be baptized  nor was any attention paid to
their morals  i was very sorry for this mock christianity  and had
just an opportunity to take some of them once to church before we
sailed  we embarked in the month of november       on board of the
sloop morning star  captain david miller  and sailed for jamaica  in
our passage  i took all the pains that i could to instruct the indian
prince in the doctrines of christianity  of which he was entirely
ignorant  and  to my great joy  he was quite attentive  and received
with gladness the truths that the lord enabled me to set forth to him 
i taught him in the compass of eleven days all the letters  and he
could put even two or three of them together and spell them  i had
fox s martyrology with cuts  and he used to be very fond of looking
into it  and would ask many questions about the papal cruelties he saw
depicted there  which i explained to him  i made such progress with
this youth  especially in religion  that when i used to go to bed at
different hours of the night  if he was in his bed  he would get up on
purpose to go to prayer with me  without any other clothes than his
shirt  and before he would eat any of his meals amongst the gentlemen
in the cabin  he would first come to me to pray  as he called it  i
was well pleased at this  and took great delight in him  and used much
supplication to god for his conversion  i was in full hope of seeing
daily every appearance of that change which i could wish  not knowing
the devices of satan  who had many of his emissaries to sow his tares
as fast as i sowed the good seed  and pull down as fast as i built up 
thus we went on nearly four fifths of our passage  when satan at last
got the upper hand  some of his messengers  seeing this poor heathen
much advanced in piety  began to ask him whether i had converted him
to christianity  laughed  and made their jest at him  for which i
rebuked them as much as i could  but this treatment caused the prince
to halt between two opinions  some of the true sons of belial  who did
not believe that there was any hereafter  told him never to fear the
devil  for there was none existing  and if ever he came to the prince 
they desired he might be sent to them  thus they teazed the poor
innocent youth  so that he would not learn his book any more  he would
not drink nor carouse with these ungodly actors  nor would he be with
me  even at prayers  this grieved me very much  i endeavoured to
persuade him as well as i could  but he would not come  and entreated
him very much to tell me his reasons for acting thus  at last he asked
me   how comes it that all the white men on board who can read and
write  and observe the sun  and know all things  yet swear  lie  and
get drunk  only excepting yourself   i answered him  the reason was 
that they did not fear god  and that if any one of them died so they
could not go to  or be happy with god  he replied  that if these
persons went to hell he would go to hell too  i was sorry to hear
this  and  as he sometimes had the toothach  and also some other
persons in the ship at the same time  i asked him if their toothach
made his easy  he said  no  then i told him if he and these people
went to hell together  their pains would not make his any lighter 
this answer had great weight with him  it depressed his spirits much 
and he became ever after  during the passage  fond of being alone 
when we were in the latitude of martinico  and near making the land 
one morning we had a brisk gale of wind  and  carrying too much sail 
the main mast went over the side  many people were then all about the
deck  and the yards  masts  and rigging  came tumbling all about us 
yet there was not one of us in the least hurt  although some were
within a hair s breadth of being killed  and  particularly  i saw two
men then  by the providential hand of god  most miraculously preserved
from being smashed to pieces  on the fifth of january we made antigua
and montserrat  and ran along the rest of the islands  and on the
fourteenth we arrived at jamaica  one sunday while we were there i
took the musquito prince george to church  where he saw the sacrament
administered  when we came out we saw all kinds of people  almost from
the church door for the space of half a mile down to the waterside 
buying and selling all kinds of commodities  and these acts afforded
me great matter of exhortation to this youth  who was much astonished 
our vessel being ready to sail for the musquito shore  i went with the
doctor on board a guinea man  to purchase some slaves to carry with
us  and cultivate a plantation  and i chose them all my own
countrymen  on the twelfth of february we sailed from jamaica  and on
the eighteenth arrived at the musquito shore  at a place called
dupeupy  all our indian guests now  after i had admonished them and a
few cases of liquor given them by the doctor  took an affectionate
leave of us  and went ashore  where they were met by the musquito
king  and we never saw one of them afterwards  we then sailed to the
southward of the shore  to a place called cape gracias a dios  where
there was a large lagoon or lake  which received the emptying of two
or three very fine large rivers  and abounded much in fish and land
tortoise  some of the native indians came on board of us here  and we
used them well  and told them we were come to dwell amongst them 
which they seemed pleased at  so the doctor and i  with some others 
went with them ashore  and they took us to different places to view
the land  in order to choose a place to make a plantation of  we fixed
on a spot near a river s bank  in a rich soil  and  having got our
necessaries out of the sloop  we began to clear away the woods  and
plant different kinds of vegetables  which had a quick growth  while
we were employed in this manner  our vessel went northward to black
river to trade  while she was there  a spanish guarda costa met with
and took her  this proved very hurtful  and a great embarrassment to
us  however  we went on with the culture of the land  we used to make
fires every night all around us  to keep off wild beasts  which  as
soon as it was dark  set up a most hideous roaring  our habitation
being far up in the woods  we frequently saw different kinds of
animals  but none of them ever hurt us  except poisonous snakes  the
bite of which the doctor used to cure by giving to the patient  as
soon as possible  about half a tumbler of strong rum  with a good deal
of cayenne pepper in it  in this manner he cured two natives and one
of his own slaves  the indians were exceedingly fond of the doctor 
and they had good reason for it  for i believe they never had such an
useful man amongst them  they came from all quarters to our dwelling 
and some  woolwow   or flat headed indians  who lived fifty or sixty
miles above our river  and this side of the south sea  brought us a
good deal of silver in exchange for our goods  the principal articles
we could get from our neighbouring indians  were turtle oil  and
shells  little silk grass  and some provisions  but they would not
work at any thing for us  except fishing  and a few times they
assisted to cut some trees down  in order to build us houses  which
they did exactly like the africans  by the joint labour of men  women 
and children  i do not recollect any of them to have had more than two
wives  these always accompanied their husbands when they came to our
dwelling  and then they generally carried whatever they brought to us 
and always squatted down behind their husbands  whenever we gave them
any thing to eat  the men and their wives ate it separate  i never
saw the least sign of incontinence amongst them  the women are
ornamented with beads  and fond of painting themselves  the men also
paint  even to excess  both their faces and shirts  their favourite
colour is red  the women generally cultivate the ground  and the men
are all fishermen and canoe makers  upon the whole  i never met any
nation that were so simple in their manners as these people  or had so
little ornament in their houses  neither had they  as i ever could
learn  one word expressive of an oath  the worst word i ever heard
amongst them when they were quarreling  was one that they had got from
the english  which was   you rascal   i never saw any mode of worship
among them  but in this they were not worse than their european
brethren or neighbours  for i am sorry to say that there was not one
white person in our dwelling  nor any where else that i saw in
different places i was at on the shore  that was better or more pious
than those unenlightened indians  but they either worked or slept on
sundays  and  to my sorrow  working was too much sunday s employment
with ourselves  so much so  that in some length of time we really did
not know one day from another  this mode of living laid the foundation
of my decamping at last  the natives are well made and warlike  and
they particularly boast of having never been conquered by the
spaniards  they are great drinkers of strong liquors when they can get
them  we used to distil rum from pine apples  which were very
plentiful here  and then we could not get them away from our place 
yet they seemed to be singular  in point of honesty  above any other
nation i was ever amongst  the country being hot  we lived under an
open shed  where we had all kinds of goods  without a door or a lock
to any one article  yet we slept in safety  and never lost any thing 
or were disturbed  this surprised us a good deal  and the doctor 
myself  and others  used to say  if we were to lie in that manner in
europe we should have our throats cut the first night  the indian
governor goes once in a certain time all about the province or
district  and has a number of men with him as attendants and
assistants  he settles all the differences among the people  like the
judge here  and is treated with very great respect  he took care to
give us timely notice before he came to our habitation  by sending his
stick as a token  for rum  sugar  and gunpowder  which we did not
refuse sending  and at the same time we made the utmost preparation to
receive his honour and his train  when he came with his tribe  and all
our neighbouring chieftains  we expected to find him a grave reverend
judge  solid and sagacious  but instead of that  before he and his
gang came in sight  we heard them very clamorous  and they even had
plundered some of our good neighbouring indians  having intoxicated
themselves with our liquor  when they arrived we did not know what to
make of our new guests  and would gladly have dispensed with the
honour of their company  however  having no alternative  we feasted
them plentifully all the day till the evening  when the governor 
getting quite drunk  grew very unruly  and struck one of our most
friendly chiefs  who was our nearest neighbour  and also took his
gold laced hat from him  at this a great commotion taken place  and
the doctor interfered to make peace  as we could all understand one
another  but to no purpose  and at last they became so outrageous that
the doctor  fearing he might get into trouble  left the house  and
made the best of his way to the nearest wood  leaving me to do as well
as i could among them  i was so enraged with the governor  that i
could have wished to have seen him tied fast to a tree and flogged for
his behaviour  but i had not people enough to cope with his party  i
therefore thought of a stratagem to appease the riot  recollecting a
passage i had read in the life of columbus  when he was amongst the
indians in mexico or peru  where  on some occasion  he frightened
them  by telling them of certain events in the heavens  i had recourse
to the same expedient  and it succeeded beyond my most sanguine
expectations  when i had formed my determination  i went in the midst
of them  and  taking hold of the governor  i pointed up to the
heavens  i menaced him and the rest  i told them god lived there  and
that he was angry with them  and they must not quarrel so  that they
were all brothers  and if they did not leave off  and go away quietly 
i would take the book  pointing to the bible   read  and  tell  god to
make them dead  this was something like magic  the clamour immediately
ceased  and i gave them some rum and a few other things  after which
they went away peaceably  and the governor afterwards gave our
neighbour  who was called captain plasmyah  his hat again  when the
doctor returned  he was exceedingly glad at my success in thus getting
rid of our troublesome guests  the musquito people within our
vicinity  out of respect to the doctor  myself and his people  made
entertainments of the grand kind  called in their tongue  tourrie  or
 dryckbot   the english of this expression is  a feast of drinking
about  of which it seems a corruption of language  the drink consisted
of pine apples roasted  and casades chewed or beaten in mortars 
which  after lying some time  ferments  and becomes so strong as to
intoxicate  when drank in any quantity  we had timely notice given to
us of the entertainment  a white family  within five miles of us  told
us how the drink was made  and i and two others went before the time
to the village  where the mirth was appointed to be held  and there we
saw the whole art of making the drink  and also the kind of animals
that were to be eaten there  i cannot say the sight of either the
drink or the meat were enticing to me  they had some thousands of pine
apples roasting  which they squeezed  dirt and all  into a canoe they
had there for the purpose  the casade drink was in beef barrels and
other vessels  and looked exactly like hog wash  men  women  and
children  were thus employed in roasting the pine apples  and
squeezing them with their hands  for food they had many land torpins
or tortoises  some dried turtle  and three large alligators alive  and
tied fast to the trees  i asked the people what they were going to do
with these alligators  and i was told they were to be eaten  i was
much surprised at this  and went home  not a little disgusted at the
preparations  when the day of the feast was come  we took some rum
with us  and went to the appointed place  where we found a great
assemblage of these people  who received us very kindly  the mirth had
begun before we came  and they were dancing with music  and the
musical instruments were nearly the same as those of any other sable
people  but  as i thought  much less melodious than any other nation i
ever knew  they had many curious gestures in dancing  and a variety of
motions and postures of their bodies  which to me were in no wise
attracting  the males danced by themselves  and the females also by
themselves  as with us  the doctor shewed his people the example  by
immediately joining the women s party  though not by their choice  on
perceiving the women disgusted  he joined the males  at night there
were great illuminations  by setting fire to many pine trees  while
the dryckbot went round merrily by calabashes or gourds  but the
liquor might more justly be called eating than drinking  one owden 
the oldest father in the vicinity  was dressed in a strange and
terrifying form  around his body were skins adorned with different
kinds of feathers  and he had on his head a very large and high
head piece  in the form of a grenadier s cap  with prickles like a
porcupine  and he made a certain noise which resembled the cry of an
alligator  our people skipped amongst them out of complaisance  though
some could not drink of their tourrie  but our rum met with customers
enough  and was soon gone  the alligators were killed and some of them
roasted  their manner of roasting is by digging a hole in the earth 
and filling it with wood  which they burn to coal  and then they lay
sticks across  on which they set the meat  i had a raw piece of the
alligator in my hand  it was very rich  i thought it looked like fresh
salmon  and it had a most fragrant smell  but i could not eat any of
it  this merry making at last ended without the least discord in any
person in the company  although it was made up of different nations
and complexions  the rainy season came on here about the latter end of
may  which continued till august very heavily  so that the rivers were
overflowed  and our provisions then in the ground were washed away  i
thought this was in some measure a judgment upon us for working on
sundays  and it hurt my mind very much  i often wished to leave this
place and sail for europe  for our mode of procedure and living in
this heathenish form was very irksome to me  the word of god saith 
 what does it avail a man if he gain the whole world  and lose his own
soul   this was much and heavily impressed on my mind  and  though i
did not know how to speak to the doctor for my discharge  it was
disagreeable for me to stay any longer  but about the middle of june i
took courage enough to ask him for it  he was very unwilling at first
to grant my request  but i gave him so many reasons for it  that at
last he consented to my going  and gave me the following certificate
of my behaviour 

      the bearer  gustavus vassa  has served me several years
     with strict honesty  sobriety  and fidelity  i can 
     therefore  with justice recommend him for these
     qualifications  and indeed in every respect i consider him
     as an excellent servant  i do hereby certify that he always
     behaved well  and that he is perfectly trust worthy

      musquito shore  june           

though i was much attached to the doctor  i was happy when he
consented  i got every thing ready for my departure  and hired some
indians  with a large canoe  to carry me off  all my poor countrymen 
the slaves  when they heard of my leaving them  were very sorry  as i
had always treated them with care and affection  and did every thing i
could to comfort the poor creatures  and render their condition easy 
having taken leave of my old friends and companions  on the   th of
june  accompanied by the doctor  i left that spot of the world  and
went southward above twenty miles along the river  there i found a
sloop  the captain of which told me he was going to jamaica  having
agreed for my passage with him and one of the owners  who was also on
board  named hughes  the doctor and i parted  not without shedding
tears on both sides  the vessel then sailed along the river till
night  when she stopped in a lagoon within the same river  during the
night a schooner belonging to the same owners came in  and  as she was
in want of hands  hughes  the owner of the sloop  asked me to go in
the schooner as a sailor  and said he would give me wages  i thanked
him  but i said i wanted to go to jamaica  he then immediately changed
his tone  and swore  and abused me very much  and asked how i came to
be freed  i told him  and said that i came into that vicinity with dr 
irving  whom he had seen that day  this account was of no use  he
still swore exceedingly at me  and cursed the master for a fool that
sold me my freedom  and the doctor for another in letting me go from
him  then he desired me to go in the schooner  or else i should not go
out of the sloop as a freeman  i said this was very hard  and begged
to be put on shore again  but he swore that i should not  i said i had
been twice amongst the turks  yet had never seen any such usage with
them  and much less could i have expected any thing of this kind
amongst christians  this incensed him exceedingly  and  with a volley
of oaths and imprecations  he replied   christians  damn you  you are
one of st  paul s men  but by g      except you have st  paul s or st 
peter s faith  and walk upon the water to the shore  you shall not go
out of the vessel   which i now found was going amongst the spaniards
towards carthagena  where he swore he would sell me  i simply asked
him what right he had to sell me  but  without another word  he made
some of his people tie ropes round each of my ancles  and also to each
wrist  and another rope round my body  and hoisted me up without
letting my feet touch or rest upon any thing  thus i hung  without any
crime committed  and without judge or jury  merely because i was a
free man  and could not by the law get any redress from a white person
in those parts of the world  i was in great pain from my situation 
and cried and begged very hard for some mercy  but all in vain  my
tyrant  in a great rage  brought a musquet out of the cabin  and
loaded it before me and the crew  and swore that he would shoot me if
i cried any more  i had now no alternative  i therefore remained
silent  seeing not one white man on board who said a word on my
behalf  i hung in that manner from between ten and eleven o clock at
night till about one in the morning  when  finding my cruel abuser
fast asleep  i begged some of his slaves to slack the rope that was
round my body  that my feet might rest on something  this they did at
the risk of being cruelly used by their master  who beat some of them
severely at first for not tying me when he commanded them  whilst i
remained in this condition  till between five and six o clock next
morning  i trust i prayed to god to forgive this blasphemer  who cared
not what he did  but when he got up out of his sleep in the morning
was of the very same temper and disposition as when he left me at
night  when they got up the anchor  and the vessel was getting under
way  i once more cried and begged to be released  and now  being
fortunately in the way of their hoisting the sails  they released me 
when i was let down  i spoke to one mr  cox  a carpenter  whom i knew
on board  on the impropriety of this conduct  he also knew the doctor 
and the good opinion he ever had of me  this man then went to the
captain  and told him not to carry me away in that manner  that i was
the doctor s steward  who regarded me very highly  and would resent
this usage when he should come to know it  on which he desired a young
man to put me ashore in a small canoe i brought with me  this sound
gladdened my heart  and i got hastily into the canoe and set off 
whilst my tyrant was down in the cabin  but he soon spied me out  when
i was not above thirty or forty yards from the vessel  and  running
upon the deck with a loaded musket in his hand  he presented it at me 
and swore heavily and dreadfully  that he would shoot me that instant 
if i did not come back on board  as i knew the wretch would have done
as he said  without hesitation  i put back to the vessel again  but 
as the good lord would have it  just as i was alongside he was abusing
the captain for letting me go from the vessel  which the captain
returned  and both of them soon got into a very great heat  the young
man that was with me now got out of the canoe  the vessel was sailing
on fast with a smooth sea  and i then thought it was neck or nothing 
so at that instant i set off again  for my life  in the canoe  towards
the shore  and fortunately the confusion was so great amongst them on
board  that i got out of the reach of the musquet shot unnoticed 
while the vessel sailed on with a fair wind a different way  so that
they could not overtake me without tacking  but even before that could
be done i should have been on shore  which i soon reached  with many
thanks to god for this unexpected deliverance  i then went and told
the other owner  who lived near that shore  with whom i had agreed for
my passage  of the usage i had met with  he was very much astonished 
and appeared very sorry for it  after treating me with kindness  he
gave me some refreshment  and three heads of roasted indian corn  for
a voyage of about eighteen miles south  to look for another vessel  he
then directed me to an indian chief of a district  who was also the
musquito admiral  and had once been at our dwelling  after which i set
off with the canoe across a large lagoon alone  for i could not get
any one to assist me   though i was much jaded  and had pains in my
bowels  by means of the rope i had hung by the night before  i was
therefore at different times unable to manage the canoe  for the
paddling was very laborious  however  a little before dark i got to my
destined place  where some of the indians knew me  and received me
kindly  i asked for the admiral  and they conducted me to his
dwelling  he was glad to see me  and refreshed me with such things as
the place afforded  and i had a hammock to sleep in  they acted
towards me more like christians than those whites i was amongst the
last night  though they had been baptized  i told the admiral i wanted
to go to the next port to get a vessel to carry me to jamaica  and
requested him to send the canoe back which i then had  for which i was
to pay him  he agreed with me  and sent five able indians with a large
canoe to carry my things to my intended place  about fifty miles  and
we set off the next morning  when we got out of the lagoon and went
along shore  the sea was so high that the canoe was oftentimes very
near being filled with water  we were obliged to go ashore and drag
across different necks of land  we were also two nights in the swamps 
which swarmed with musquito flies  and they proved troublesome to us 
this tiresome journey of land and water ended  however  on the third
day  to my great joy  and i got on board of a sloop commanded by one
captain jenning  she was then partly loaded  and he told me he was
expecting daily to sail for jamaica  and having agreed with me to work
my passage  i went to work accordingly  i was not many days on board
before we sailed  but to my sorrow and disappointment  though used to
such tricks  we went to the southward along the musquito shore 
instead of steering for jamaica  i was compelled to assist in cutting
a great deal of mahogany wood on the shore as we coasted along it  and
load the vessel with it  before she sailed  this fretted me much  but 
as i did not know how to help myself among these deceivers  i thought
patience was the only remedy i had left  and even that was forced 
there was much hard work and little victuals on board  except by good
luck we happened to catch turtles  on this coast there was also a
particular kind of fish called manatee  which is most excellent
eating  and the flesh is more like beef than fish  the scales are as
large as a shilling  and the skin thicker than i ever saw that of any
other fish  within the brackish waters along shore there were likewise
vast numbers of alligators  which made the fish scarce  i was on board
this sloop sixteen days  during which  in our coasting  we came to
another place  where there was a smaller sloop called the indian
queen  commanded by one john baker  he also was an englishman  and had
been a long time along the shore trading for turtle shells and silver 
and had got a good quantity of each on board  he wanted some hands
very much  and  understanding i was a free man  and wanted to go to
jamaica  he told me if he could get one or two  that he would sail
immediately for that island  he also pretended to me some marks of
attention and respect  and promised to give me forty five shillings
sterling a month if i would go with him  i thought this much better
than cutting wood for nothing  i therefore told the other captain that
i wanted to go to jamaica in the other vessel  but he would not listen
to me  and  seeing me resolved to go in a day or two  he got the
vessel to sail  intending to carry me away against my will  this
treatment mortified me extremely  i immediately  according to an
agreement i had made with the captain of the indian queen  called for
her boat  which was lying near us  and it came alongside  and  by the
means of a north pole shipmate which i met with in the sloop i was in 
i got my things into the boat  and went on board of the indian queen 
july the   th  a few days after i was there  we got all things ready
and sailed  but again  to my great mortification  this vessel still
went to the south  nearly as far as carthagena  trading along the
coast  instead of going to jamaica  as the captain had promised me 
and  what was worst of all  he was a very cruel and bloody minded man 
and was a horrid blasphemer  among others he had a white pilot  one
stoker  whom he beat often as severely as he did some negroes he had
on board  one night in particular  after he had beaten this man most
cruelly  he put him into the boat  and made two negroes row him to a
desolate key  or small island  and he loaded two pistols  and swore
bitterly that he would shoot the negroes if they brought stoker on
board again  there was not the least doubt but that he would do as he
said  and the two poor fellows were obliged to obey the cruel mandate 
but  when the captain was asleep  the two negroes took a blanket and
carried it to the unfortunate stoker  which i believe was the means of
saving his life from the annoyance of insects  a great deal of
entreaty was used with the captain the next day  before he would
consent to let stoker come on board  and when the poor man was brought
on board he was very ill  from his situation during the night  and he
remained so till he was drowned a little time after  as we sailed
southward we came to many uninhabited islands  which were overgrown
with fine large cocoa nuts  as i was very much in want of provisions 
i brought a boat load of them on board  which lasted me and others for
several weeks  and afforded us many a delicious repast in our
scarcity  one day  before this  i could not help observing the
providential hand of god  that ever supplies all our wants  though in
the ways and manner we know not  i had been a whole day without food 
and made signals for boats to come off  but in vain  i therefore
earnestly prayed to god for relief in my need  and at the close of the
evening i went off the deck  just as i laid down i heard a noise on
the deck  and  not knowing what it meant  i went directly on the the
deck again  when what should i see but a fine large fish about seven
or eight pounds  which had jumped aboard  i took it  and admired  with
thanks  the good hand of god  and  what i considered as not less
extraordinary  the captain  who was very avaricious  did not attempt
to take it from me  there being only him and i on board  for the rest
were all gone ashore trading  sometimes the people did not come off
for some days  this used to fret the captain  and then he would vent
his fury on me by beating me  or making me feel in other cruel ways 
one day especially  in his wild  wicked  and mad career  after
striking me several times with different things  and once across my
mouth  even with a red burning stick out of the fire  he got a barrel
of gunpowder on the deck  and swore that he would blow up the vessel 
i was then at my wit s end  and earnestly prayed to god to direct me 
the head was out of the barrel  and the captain took a lighted stick
out of the fire to blow himself and me up  because there was a vessel
then in sight coming in  which he supposed was a spaniard  and he was
afraid of falling into their hands  seeing this i got an axe 
unnoticed by him  and placed myself between him and the powder  having
resolved in myself as soon as he attempted to put the fire in the
barrel to chop him down that instant  i was more than an hour in this
situation  during which he struck me often  still keeping the fire in
his hand for this wicked purpose  i really should have thought myself
justifiable in any other part of the world if i had killed him  and
prayed to god  who gave me a mind which rested solely on himself  i
prayed for resignation  that his will might be done  and the following
two portions of his holy word  which occurred to my mind  buoyed up my
hope  and kept me from taking the life of this wicked man   he hath
determined the times before appointed  and set bounds to our
habitations   acts xvii      and   who is there amongst you that
feareth the lord  that obeyeth the voice of his servant  that walketh
in darkness and hath no light  let him trust in the name of the lord 
and stay upon his god   isaiah        and thus by the grace of god i
was enabled to do  i found him a present help in the time of need  and
the captain s fury began to subside as the night approached  but i
found 

     that he who cannot stem his anger s tide
    doth a wild horse without a bridle ride  

the next morning we discovered that the vessel which had caused such a
fury in the captain was an english sloop  they soon came to an anchor
where we were  and  to my no small surprise  i learned that doctor
irving was on board of her on his way from the musquito shore to
jamaica  i was for going immediately to see this old master and
friend  but the captain would not suffer me to leave the vessel  i
then informed the doctor  by letter  how i was treated  and begged
that he would take me out of the sloop  but he informed me that it was
not in his power  as he was a passenger himself  but he sent me some
rum and sugar for my own use  i now learned that after i had left the
estate which i managed for this gentleman on the musquito shore 
during which the slaves were well fed and comfortable  a white
overseer had supplied my place  this man  through inhumanity and
ill judged avarice  beat and cut the poor slaves most unmercifully 
and the consequence was  that every one got into a large puriogua
canoe  and endeavoured to escape  but not knowing where to go  or how
to manage the canoe  they were all drowned  in consequence of which
the doctor s plantation was left uncultivated  and he was now
returning to jamaica to purchase more slaves and stock it again  on
the   th of october the indian queen arrived at kingston in jamaica 
when we were unloaded i demanded my wages  which amounted to eight
pounds and five shillings sterling  but captain baker refused to give
me one farthing  although it was the hardest earned money i ever
worked for in my life  i found out doctor irving upon this  and
acquainted him of the captain s knavery  he did all he could to help
me to get my money  and we went to every magistrate in kingston  and
there were nine   but they all refused to do any thing for me  and
said my oath could not be admitted against a white man  nor was this
all  for baker threatened that he would beat me severely if he could
catch me for attempting to demand my money  and this he would have
done  but that i got  by means of dr  irving  under the protection of
captain douglas of the squirrel man of war  i thought this exceedingly
hard usage  though indeed i found it to be too much the practice there
to pay free men for their labour in this manner  one day i went with a
free negroe taylor  named joe diamond  to one mr  cochran  who was
indebted to him some trifling sum  and the man  not being able to get
his money  began to murmur  the other immediately took a horse whip to
pay him with it  but  by the help of a good pair of heels  the taylor
got off  such oppressions as these made me seek for a vessel to get
off the island as fast as i could  and by the mercy of god i found a
ship in november bound for england  when i embarked with a convoy 
after having taken a last farewell of doctor irving  when i left
jamaica he was employed in refining sugars  and some months after my
arrival in england i learned  with much sorrow  that this my amiable
friend was dead  owing to his having eaten some poisoned fish  we had
many very heavy gales of wind in our passage  in the course of which
no material incident occurred  except that an american privateer 
falling in with the fleet  was captured and set fire to by his
majesty s ship the squirrel  on january the seventh        we arrived
at plymouth  i was happy once more to tread upon english ground  and 
after passing some little time at plymouth and exeter among some pious
friends  whom i was happy to see  i went to london with a heart
replete with thanks to god for all past mercies

      different transactions of the author s life till the
     present time  his application to the late bishop of london
     to be appointed a missionary to africa  some account of his
     share in the conduct of the late expedition to sierra
     leona  petition to the queen  conclusion  


such were the various scenes which i was a witness to  and the fortune
i experienced until the year       since that period my life has been
more uniform  and the incidents of it fewer  than in any other equal
number of years preceding  i therefore hasten to the conclusion of a
narrative  which i fear the reader may think already sufficiently
tedious 

i had suffered so many impositions in my commercial transactions in
different parts of the world  that i became heartily disgusted with
the sea faring life  and i was determined not to return to it  at
least for some time  i therefore once more engaged in service shortly
after my return  and continued for the most part in this situation
until      

soon after my arrival in london  i saw a remarkable circumstance
relative to african complexion  which i thought so extraordinary  that
i beg leave just to mention it  a white negro woman  that i had
formerly seen in london and other parts  had married a white man  by
whom she had three boys  and they were every one mulattoes  and yet
they had fine light hair  in      i served governor macnamara  who had
been a considerable time on the coast of africa  in the time of my
service  i used to ask frequently other servants to join me in family
prayers  but this only excited their mockery  however  the governor 
understanding that i was of a religious turn  wished to know of what
religion i was  i told him i was a protestant of the church of
england  agreeable to the thirty nine articles of that church  and
that whomsoever i found to preach according to that doctrine  those i
would hear  a few days after this  we had some more discourse on the
same subject  the governor spoke to me on it again  and said that he
would  if i chose  as he thought i might be of service in converting
my countrymen to the gospel faith  get me sent out as a missionary to
africa  i at first refused going  and told him how i had been served
on a like occasion by some white people the last voyage i went to
jamaica  when i attempted  if it were the will of god  to be the means
of converting the indian prince  and i said i supposed they would
serve me worse than alexander the coppersmith did st  paul  if i
should attempt to go amongst them in africa  he told me not to fear 
for he would apply to the bishop of london to get me ordained  on
these terms i consented to the governor s proposal to go to africa  in
hope of doing good if possible amongst my countrymen  so  in order to
have me sent out properly  we immediately wrote the following letters
to the late bishop of london 

      to the right reverend father in god  
          robert   lord bishop of london  
               the memorial of gustavus vassa

     sheweth 

     that your memorialist is a native of africa  and has a
     knowledge of the manners and customs of the inhabitants of
     that country 

     that your memorialist has resided in different parts of
     europe for twenty two years last past  and embraced the
     christian faith in the year      

     that your memorialist is desirous of returning to africa as
     a missionary  if encouraged by your lordship  in hopes of
     being able to prevail upon his countrymen to become
     christians  and your memorialist is the more induced to
     undertake the same  from the success that has attended the
     like undertakings when encouraged by the portuguese through
     their different settlements on the coast of africa  and also
     by the dutch  both governments encouraging the blacks  who 
     by their education are qualified to undertake the same  and
     are found more proper than european clergymen  unacquainted
     with the language and customs of the country 

     your memorialist s only motive for soliciting the office of
     a missionary is  that he may be a means  under god  of
     reforming his countrymen and persuading them to embrace the
     christian religion  therefore your memorialist humbly prays
     your lordship s encouragement and support in the
     undertaking

     my lord 

     i have resided near seven years on the coast of africa  for
     most part of the time as commanding officer  from the
     knowledge i have of the country and its inhabitants  i am
     inclined to think that the within plan will be attended with
     great success  if countenanced by your lordship  i beg leave
     further to represent to your lordship  that the like
     attempts  when encouraged by other governments  have met
     with uncommon success  and at this very time i know a very
     respectable character a black priest at cape coast castle  i
     know the within named gustavus vassa  and believe him a
     moral good man 

                                          i have the honour to be 
                                              my lord 
                                                your lordship s
                                        humble and obedient servant

     grove    th march      

this letter was also accompanied by the following from doctor wallace 
who had resided in africa for many years  and whose sentiments on the
subject of an african mission were the same with governor macnamara s 

                                                march           

     my lord 

     i have resided near five years on senegambia on the coast of
     africa  and have had the honour of filling very considerable
     employments in that province  i do approve of the within
     plan  and think the undertaking very laudable and proper 
     and that it deserves your lordship s protection and
     encouragement  in which case it must be attended with the
     intended success 

                                       i am 
                                          my lord 
                                             your lordship s
                                   humble and obedient servant 
                                                  thomas wallace 

with these letters  i waited on the bishop by the governor s desire 
and presented them to his lordship  he received me with much
condescension and politeness  but  from some certain scruples of
delicacy  declined to ordain me 

my sole motive for thus dwelling on this transaction  or inserting
these papers  is the opinion which gentlemen of sense and education 
who are acquainted with africa  entertain of the probability of
converting the inhabitants of it to the faith of jesus christ  if the
attempt were countenanced by the legislature 

shortly after this i left the governor  and served a nobleman in the
devonshire militia  with whom i was encamped at coxheath for some
time  but the operations there were too minute and uninteresting to
make a detail of 

in the year      i visited eight counties in wales  from motives of
curiosity  while i was in that part of the country i was led to go
down into a coal pit in shropshire  but my curiosity nearly cost me my
life  for while i was in the pit the coals fell in  and buried one
poor man  who was not far from me  upon this i got out as fast as i
could  thinking the surface of the earth the safest part of it 

in the spring      i thought of visiting old ocean again  in
consequence of this i embarked as steward on board a fine new ship
called the london  commanded by martin hopkin  and sailed for
new york  i admired this city very much  it is large and well built 
and abounds with provisions of all kinds  while we lay here a
circumstance happened which i thought extremely singular   one day a
malefactor was to be executed on a gallows  but with a condition that
if any woman  having nothing on but her shift  married the man under
the gallows  his life was to be saved  this extraordinary privilege
was claimed  a woman presented herself  and the marriage ceremony was
performed  our ship having got laden we returned to london in january
      when she was ready again for another voyage  the captain being
an agreeable man  i sailed with him from hence in the spring  march
      for philadelphia  on the fifth of april we took our departure
from the land s end  with a pleasant gale  and about nine o clock that
night the moon shone bright  and the sea was smooth  while our ship
was going free by the wind  at the rate of about four or five miles an
hour  at this time another ship was going nearly as fast as we on the
opposite point  meeting us right in the teeth  yet none on board
observed either ship until we struck each other forcibly head and
head  to the astonishment and consternation of both crews  she did us
much damage  but i believe we did her more  for when we passed by each
other  which we did very quickly  they called to us to bring to  and
hoist out our boat  but we had enough to do to mind ourselves  and in
about eight minutes we saw no more of her  we refitted as well as we
could the next day  and proceeded on our voyage  and in may arrived at
philadelphia  i was very glad to see this favourite old town once
more  and my pleasure was much increased in seeing the worthy quakers
freeing and easing the burthens of many of my oppressed african
brethren  it rejoiced my heart when one of these friendly people took
me to see a free school they had erected for every denomination of
black people  whose minds are cultivated here and forwarded to virtue 
and thus they are made useful members of the community  does not the
success of this practice say loudly to the planters in the language of
scripture   go ye and do likewise  

in october      i was accompanied by some of the africans  and
presented this address of thanks to the gentlemen called friends or
quakers  in gracechurch court lombard street 

     gentlemen 

     by reading your book  entitled a caution to great britain
     and her colonies  concerning the calamitous state of the
     enslaved negroes  we the poor  oppressed  needy  and
     much degraded negroes  desire to approach you with this
     address of thanks  with our inmost love and warmest
     acknowledgment  and with the deepest sense of your
     benevolence  unwearied labour  and kind interposition 
     towards breaking the yoke of slavery  and to administer a
     little comfort and ease to thousands and tens of thousands
     of very grievously afflicted  and too heavy burthened
     negroes 

     gentlemen  could you  by perseverance  at last be enabled 
     under god  to lighten in any degree the heavy burthen of the
     afflicted  no doubt it would  in some measure  be the
     possible means  under god  of saving the souls of many of
     the oppressors  and  if so  sure we are that the god  whose
     eyes are ever upon all his creatures  and always rewards
     every true act of virtue  and regards the prayers of the
     oppressed  will give to you and yours those blessings which
     it is not in our power to express or conceive  but which we 
     as a part of those captived  oppressed  and afflicted
     people  most earnestly wish and pray for 

these gentlemen received us very kindly  with a promise to exert
themselves on behalf of the oppressed africans  and we parted 

while in town i chanced once to be invited to a quaker s wedding  the
simple and yet expressive mode used at their solemnizations is worthy
of note  the following is the true form of it 

after the company have met they have seasonable exhortations by
several of the members  the bride and bridegroom stand up  and  taking
each other by the hand in a solemn manner  the man audily declares to
this purpose 

 friends  in the fear of the lord  and in the presence of this
assembly  whom i desire to be my witnesses  i take this my friend 
m n  to be my wife  promising  through divine assistance  to be unto
her a loving and faithful husband till death separate us   and the
woman makes the like declaration  then the two first sign their names
to the record  and as many more witnesses as have a mind  i had the
honour to subscribe mine to a register in gracechurch court 
lombard street 

we returned to london in august  and our ship not going immediately to
sea  i shipped as a steward in an american ship called the harmony 
captain john willet  and left london in march       bound to
philadelphia  eleven days after sailing we carried our foremast away 
we had a nine weeks passage  which caused our trip not to succeed
well  the market for our goods proving bad  and  to make it worse  my
commander began to play me the like tricks as others too often
practise on free negroes in the west indies  but i thank god i found
many friends here  who in some measure prevented him  on my return to
london in august i was very agreeably surprised to find that the
benevolence of government had adopted the plan of some philanthropic
individuals to send the africans from hence to their native quarter 
and that some vessels were then engaged to carry them to sierra leone 
an act which redounded to the honour of all concerned in its
promotion  and filled me with prayers and much rejoicing  there was
then in the city a select committee of gentlemen for the black poor 
to some of whom i had the honour of being known  and  as soon as they
heard of my arrival they sent for me to the committee  when i came
there they informed me of the intention of government  and as they
seemed to think me qualified to superintend part of the undertaking 
they asked me to go with the black poor to africa  i pointed out to
them many objections to my going  and particularly i expressed some
difficulties on the account of the slave dealers  as i would certainly
oppose their traffic in the human species by every means in my power 
however these objections were over ruled by the gentlemen of the
committee  who prevailed on me to go  and recommended me to the
honourable commissioners of his majesty s navy as a proper person to
act as commissary for government in the intended expedition  and they
accordingly appointed me in november      to that office  and gave me
sufficient power to act for the government in the capacity of
commissary  having received my warrant and the following order 

      by the principal officers and commissioners of
     his majesty s navy  

     whereas you were directed  by our warrant of the  th of last
     month  to receive into your charge from mr  irving the
     surplus provisions remaining of what was provided for the
     voyage  as well as the provisions for the support of the
     black poor  after the landing at sierra leone  with the
     cloathing  tools  and all other articles provided at
     government s expense  and as the provisions were laid in at
     the rate of two months for the voyage  and for four months
     after the landing  but the number embarked being so much
     less than was expected  whereby there may be a considerable
     surplus of provisions  cloathing   c  these are  in addition
     to former orders  to direct and require you to appropriate
     or dispose of such surplus to the best advantage you can for
     the benefit of government  keeping and rendering to us a
     faithful account of what you do herein  and for your
     guidance in preventing any white persons going  who are not
     intended to have the indulgences of being carried thither 
     we send you herewith a list of those recommended by the
     committee for the black poor as proper persons to be
     permitted to embark  and acquaint you that you are not to
     suffer any others to go who do not produce a certificate
     from the committee for the black poor  of their having their
     permission for it  for which this shall be your warrant 
     dated at the navy office  january          

                                                      j  hinslow

                                                      w  palmer 

     to mr  gustavus vassa 
     commissary of provisions and
     stores for the black poor
     going to sierra leone 

i proceeded immediately to the execution of my duty on board the
vessels destined for the voyage  where i continued till the march
following 

during my continuance in the employment of government  i was struck
with the flagrant abuses committed by the agent  and endeavoured to
remedy them  but without effect  one instance  among many which i
could produce  may serve as a specimen  government had ordered to be
provided all necessaries  slops  as they are called  included  for    
persons  however  not being able to muster more than      i was
ordered to send the superfluous slops   c  to the king s stores at
portsmouth  but  when i demanded them for that purpose from the agent 
it appeared they had never been bought  though paid for by government 
but that was not all  government were not the only objects of
peculation  these poor people suffered infinitely more  their
accommodations were most wretched  many of them wanted beds  and many
more cloathing and other necessaries  for the truth of this  and much
more  i do not seek credit from my own assertion  i appeal to the
testimony of capt  thompson  of the nautilus  who convoyed us  to whom
i applied in february      for a remedy  when i had remonstrated to
the agent in vain  and even brought him to be a witness of the
injustice and oppression i complained of  i appeal also to a letter
written by these wretched people  so early as the beginning of the
preceding january  and published in the morning herald of the  th of
that month  signed by twenty of their chiefs 

i could not silently suffer government to be thus cheated  and my
countrymen plundered and oppressed  and even left destitute of the
necessaries for almost their existence  i therefore informed the
commissioners of the navy of the agent s proceeding  but my dismission
was soon after procured  by means of a gentleman in the city  whom the
agent  conscious of his peculation  had deceived by letter  and whom 
moreover  empowered the same agent to receive on board  at the
government expense  a number of persons as passengers  contrary to the
orders i received  by this i suffered a considerable loss in my
property  however  the commissioners were satisfied with my conduct 
and wrote to capt  thompson  expressing their approbation of it 

thus provided  they proceeded on their voyage  and at last  worn out
by treatment  perhaps not the most mild  and wasted by sickness 
brought on by want of medicine  cloaths  bedding   c  they reached
sierra leone just at the commencement of the rains  at that season of
the year it is impossible to cultivate the lands  their provisions
therefore were exhausted before they could derive any benefit from
agriculture  and it is not surprising that many  especially the
lascars  whose constitutions are very tender  and who had been cooped
up in ships from october to june  and accommodated in the manner i
have mentioned  should be so wasted by their confinement as not long
to survive it 

thus ended my part of the long talked of expedition to sierra leone 
an expedition which  however unfortunate in the event  was humane and
politic in its design  nor was its failure owing to government  every
thing was done on their part  but there was evidently sufficient
mismanagement attending the conduct and execution of it to defeat its
success 

i should not have been so ample in my account of this transaction  had
not the share i bore in it been made the subject of partial
animadversion  and even my dismission from my employment thought
worthy of being made by some a matter of public triumph x   the
motives which might influence any person to descend to a petty contest
with an obscure african  and to seek gratification by his depression 
perhaps it is not proper here to inquire into or relate  even if its
detection were necessary to my vindication  but i thank heaven it is
not  i wish to stand by my own integrity  and not to shelter myself
under the impropriety of another  and i trust the behaviour of the
commissioners of the navy to me entitle me to make this assertion  for
after i had been dismissed  march     i drew up a memorial thus 


      to the right honourable the lords commissioners of
     his majesty s treasury 
     the memorial and petition of  gustavus vassa  a black man 
     late commissary to the black poor going to  africa 

     humbly sheweth 

     that your lordships  memorialist was  by the honourable the
     commissioners of his majesty s navy  on the  th of december
     last  appointed to the above employment by warrant from that
     board 

     that he accordingly proceeded to the execution of his duty
     on board of the vernon  being one of the ships appointed to
     proceed to africa with the above poor 

     that your memorialist  to his great grief and astonishment 
     received a letter of dismission from the honourable
     commissioners of the navy  by your lordships  orders 

     that  conscious of having acted with the most perfect
     fidelity and the greatest assiduity in discharging the trust
     reposed in him  he is altogether at a loss to conceive the
     reasons of your lordships  having altered the favourable
     opinion you were pleased to conceive of him  sensible that
     your lordships would not proceed to so severe a measure
     without some apparent good cause  he therefore has every
     reason to believe that his conduct has been grossly
     misrepresented to your lordships  and he is the more
     confirmed in his opinion  because  by opposing measures of
     others concerned in the same expedition  which tended to
     defeat your lordships  humane intentions  and to put the
     government to a very considerable additional expense  he
     created a number of enemies  whose misrepresentations  he
     has too much reason to believe  laid the foundation of his
     dismission  unsupported by friends  and unaided by the
     advantages of a liberal education  he can only hope for
     redress from the justice of his cause  in addition to the
     mortification of having been removed from his employment 
     and the advantage which he reasonably might have expected to
     have derived therefrom  he has had the misfortune to have
     sunk a considerable part of his little property in fitting
     himself out  and in other expenses arising out of his
     situation  an account of which he here annexes  your
     memorialist will not trouble your lordships with a
     vindication of any part of his conduct  because he knows not
     of what crimes he is accused  he  however  earnestly
     entreats that you will be pleased to direct an inquiry into
     his behaviour during the time he acted in the public
     service  and  if it be found that his dismission arose from
     false representations  he is confident that in your
     lordships  justice he shall find redress 

     your petitioner therefore humbly prays that your lordships
     will take his case into consideration  and that you will be
     pleased to order payment of the above referred to account 
     amounting to   l   s  and also the wages intended  which is
     most humbly submitted

the above petition was delivered into the hands of their lordships 
who were kind enough  in the space of some few months afterwards 
without hearing  to order me   l  sterling  that is    l  wages for
the time  upwards of four months  i acted a faithful part in their
service  certainly the sum is more than a free negro would have had in
the western colonies   

                                        

march the   st        i had the honour of presenting the queen with a
petition on behalf of my african brethren  which was received most
graciously by her majesty y  

      to the  queen s  most excellent majesty  

     madam 

     your majesty s well known benevolence and humanity emboldens
     me to approach your royal presence  trusting that the
     obscurity of my situation will not prevent your majesty from
     attending to the sufferings for which i plead 

     yet i do not solicit your royal pity for my own distress  my
     sufferings  although numerous  are in a measure forgotten  i
     supplicate your majesty s compassion for millions of my
     african countrymen  who groan under the lash of tyranny in
     the west indies 

     the oppression and cruelty exercised to the unhappy negroes
     there  have at length reached the british legislature  and
     they are now deliberating on its redress  even several
     persons of property in slaves in the west indies  have
     petitioned parliament against its continuance  sensible that
     it is as impolitic as it is unjust  and what is inhuman must
     ever be unwise 

     your majesty s reign has been hitherto distinguished by
     private acts of benevolence and bounty  surely the more
     extended the misery is  the greater claim it has to your
     majesty s compassion  and the greater must be your majesty s
     pleasure in administering to its relief 

     i presume  therefore  gracious queen  to implore your
     interposition with your royal consort  in favour of the
     wretched africans  that  by your majesty s benevolent
     influence  a period may now be put to their misery  and that
     they may be raised from the condition of brutes  to which
     they are at present degraded  to the rights and situation of
     freemen  and admitted to partake of the blessings of your
     majesty s happy government  so shall your majesty enjoy the
     heartfelt pleasure of procuring happiness to millions  and
     be rewarded in the grateful prayers of themselves  and of
     their posterity 

     and may the all bountiful creator shower on your majesty 
     and the royal family  every blessing that this world can
     afford  and every fulness of joy which divine revelation has
     promised us in the next 

     i am your majesty s most dutiful and devoted servant to
     command

the negro consolidated act  made by the assembly of jamaica last year 
and the new act of amendment now in agitation there  contain a proof
of the existence of those charges that have been made against the
planters relative to the treatment of their slaves 

i hope to have the satisfaction of seeing the renovation of liberty
and justice resting on the british government  to vindicate the honour
of our common nature  these are concerns which do not perhaps belong
to any particular office  but  to speak more seriously to every man of
sentiment  actions like these are the just and sure foundation of
future fame  a reversion  though remote  is coveted by some noble
minds as a substantial good  it is upon these grounds that i hope and
expect the attention of gentlemen in power  these are designs
consonant to the elevation of their rank  and the dignity of their
stations  they are ends suitable to the nature of a free and generous
government  and  connected with views of empire and dominion  suited
to the benevolence and solid merit of the legislature  it is a pursuit
of substantial greatness   may the time come  at least the speculation
to me is pleasing  when the sable people shall gratefully commemorate
the auspicious  ra of extensive freedom  then shall those persons z 
particularly be named with praise and honour  who generously proposed
and stood forth in the cause of humanity  liberty  and good policy 
and brought to the ear of the legislature designs worthy of royal
patronage and adoption  may heaven make the british senators the
dispersers of light  liberty  and science  to the uttermost parts of
the earth  then will be glory to god on the highest  on earth peace 
and goodwill to men   glory  honour  peace   c  to every soul of man
that worketh good  to the britons first   because to them the gospel
is preached  and also to the nations   those that honour their maker
have mercy on the poor    it is righteousness exalteth a nation  but
sin is a reproach to any people  destruction shall be to the workers
of iniquity  and the wicked shall fall by their own wickedness   may
the blessings of the lord be upon the heads of all those who
commiserated the cases of the oppressed negroes  and the fear of god
prolong their days  and may their expectations be filled with
gladness   the liberal devise liberal things  and by liberal things
shall stand   isaiah xxxii     they can say with pious job   did not i
weep for him that was in trouble  was not my soul grieved for the
poor   job xxx     

as the inhuman traffic of slavery is to be taken into the
consideration of the british legislature  i doubt not  if a system of
commerce was established in africa  the demand for manufactures would
most rapidly augment  as the native inhabitants will insensibly adopt
the british fashions  manners  customs   c  in proportion to the
civilization  so will be the consumption of british manufactures 

the wear and tear of a continent  nearly twice as large as europe  and
rich in vegetable and mineral productions  is much easier conceived
than calculated 

a case in point   it cost the aborigines of britain little or nothing
in clothing   c  the difference between their forefathers and the
present generation  in point of consumption  is literally infinite 
the supposition is most obvious  it will be equally immense in
africa  the same cause  viz  civilization  will ever have the same
effect 

it is trading upon safe grounds  a commercial intercourse with africa
opens an inexhaustible source of wealth to the manufacturing interests
of great britain  and to all which the slave trade is an objection 

if i am not misinformed  the manufacturing interest is equal  if not
superior  to the landed interest  as to the value  for reasons which
will soon appear  the abolition of slavery  so diabolical  will give a
most rapid extension of manufactures  which is totally and
diametrically opposite to what some interested people assert 

the manufacturers of this country must and will  in the nature and
reason of things  have a full and constant employ by supplying the
african markets 

population  the bowels and surface of africa  abound in valuable and
useful returns  the hidden treasures of centuries will be brought to
light and into circulation  industry  enterprize  and mining  will
have their full scope  proportionably as they civilize  in a word  it
lays open an endless field of commerce to the british manufactures and
merchant adventurer  the manufacturing interest and the general
interests are synonymous  the abolition of slavery would be in reality
an universal good 

tortures  murder  and every other imaginable barbarity and iniquity 
are practised upon the poor slaves with impunity  i hope the slave
trade will be abolished  i pray it may be an event at hand  the great
body of manufacturers  uniting in the cause  will considerably
facilitate and expedite it  and  as i have already stated  it is most
substantially their interest and advantage  and as such the nation s
at large   except those persons concerned in the manufacturing
neck yokes  collars  chains  hand cuffs  leg bolts  drags 
thumb screws  iron muzzles  and coffins  cats  scourges  and other
instruments of torture used in the slave trade   in a short time one
sentiment alone will prevail  from motives of interest as well as
justice and humanity  europe contains one hundred and twenty millions
of inhabitants  query  how many millions doth africa contain 
supposing the africans  collectively and individually  to expend  l  a
head in raiment and furniture yearly when civilized   c  an immensity
beyond the reach of imagination 

this i conceive to be a theory founded upon facts  and therefore an
infallible one  if the blacks were permitted to remain in their own
country  they would double themselves every fifteen years  in
proportion to such increase will be the demand for manufactures 
cotton and indigo grow spontaneously in most parts of africa  a
consideration this of no small consequence to the manufacturing towns
of great britain  it opens a most immense  glorious  and happy
prospect  the clothing   c  of a continent ten thousand miles in
circumference  and immensely rich in productions of every denomination
in return for manufactures 

i have only therefore to request the reader s indulgence and conclude 
i am far from the vanity of thinking there is any merit in this
narrative  i hope censure will be suspended  when it is considered
that it was written by one who was as unwilling as unable to adorn the
plainness of truth by the colouring of imagination  my life and
fortune have been extremely chequered  and my adventures various  even
those i have related are considerably abridged  if any incident in
this little work should appear uninteresting and trifling to most
readers  i can only say  as my excuse for mentioning it  that almost
every event of my life made an impression on my mind and influenced my
conduct  i early accustomed myself to look for the hand of god in the
minutest occurrence  and to learn from it a lesson of morality and
religion  and in this light every circumstance i have related was to
me of importance  after all  what makes any event important  unless by
its observation we become better and wiser  and learn  to do justly 
to love mercy  and to walk humbly before god   to those who are
possessed of this spirit  there is scarcely any book or incident so
trifling that does not afford some profit  while to others the
experience of ages seems of no use  and even to pour out to them the
treasures of wisdom is throwing the jewels of instruction away
