doctrina christiana


the first book printed in the philippines has been the object of a hunt
which has extended from manila to berlin  and from italy to chile 
for four hundred and fifty years  the patient research of scholars 
the scraps of evidence found in books and archives  the amazingly
accurate hypotheses of bibliographers who have sifted the material
so painstakingly gathered together  combine to make its history a
bookish detective story par excellence 

it is easy when a prisoner has been arrested and brought to the dock to
give details of his complexion  height  characteristics and identifying
marks  to fingerprint him and to photograph him  but how inadequate
was the description before his capture  how frequently did false scents
draw the pursuer off the right track  it is with this in mind that we
examine the subject of this investigation  remembering that it has not
been done before in detail  and  to complete the case  the book has
been photographed in its entirety and its facsimile herewith published 

in studying the doctrina christiana of      there are four general
problems which we shall discuss  first  we shall give a physical
description of the book  secondly  we shall trace chronologically the
bibliographical history of the doctrina  that is  we shall record the
available evidence which shows that it was the first book printed in
the philippines  and weigh the testimonies which state or imply to
the contrary  thirdly  we shall try to establish the authorship of
the text  and lastly  we shall discuss the actual printing 

it hardly needs be told why so few of the incunabula of the philippines
have survived  the paper on which they were printed was one of the most
destructible papers ever used in book production  the native worms and
insects thrived on it  and the heat and dampness took their slower but
equally certain toll  add to these enemies the acts of providence of
which the philippines have received more than their share  earthquake 
fire and flood  and the man made devastations of war  combined with the
fact that there was no systematic attempt made in the philippines to
preserve in archives and libraries the records of the past  and it
can well be understood why a scant handful of cradle books have been
preserved  the two fires of      alone  which burned the dominican
convent in manila to the ground and consumed the whole of binondo just
outside the walls  must have played untold havoc upon the records of
the early missionaries  perhaps the only copies of early philippine
books which exist today  unchronided and forgotten  are those which
were sent to europe in the   th    th and   th centuries  and may
now be lying uncatalogued in some library there 

one copy of this doctrina was sent to philip ii by the governor of
the philippines in       and in      a jesuit philologist  hervas y
panduro  printed tagalog texts from a then extant copy  yet  since
that time no example is recorded as having been seen by bibliographer
or historian  the provenance of the present one is but imperfectly
known  in the spring of      william h  schab  a new york dealer 
was in paris  and heard through a friend of the existence of a     
manila book  he expressed such incredulity at this information that his
friend  feeling his integrity impugned  telephoned the owner then and
there  and confirmed the unbelievable         delighted and enthused 
schab arranged to meet him  found that he was a paris bookseller and
collector who specialized in pacific imprints and was fully aware of
the importance of the volume  and induced him to sell the precious
doctrina  he brought it back with him to the united states and offered
it to lessing j  rosenwald  who promptly purchased it and presented it
to the library of congress  where the book had been before it reached
paris we do not know  perhaps it is the very copy sent to philip ii 
perhaps the copy from which hervas got his text  indeed  it may
have been churned to the surface by the late civil war in spain 
and sent from there to france  in the course of years from similar
sources may come other books to throw more light upon the only too
poorly documented history of the establishment of printing in the
philippine islands 



the physical description


let us first examine the book as it appears before us  the title page
reads 


            doctrina christiana  en
            lengua espa ola ytagala  cor
            regida por los religiosos de las
            ordenes impressa con licencia  en
            s  gabriel  de la orden de  s  domigo
            en manila      


the book  printed in gothic letters and tagalog     characters on
paper made from the paper mulberry  now browned and brittle with age 
consists of thirty eight leaves  comprising a title page as above 
under a woodcut     of st  dominic  with the verso originally blank 
but in this copy bearing the contemporary manuscript inscription 
 tassada en dos rreales   signed  juan de cuellar   and seventy four
pages of text in spanish  tagalog transliterated into roman letters 
and tagalog in tagalog characters  the size of the volume  which
is unbound  is       by   inches  although individual leaves vary
somewhat due to chipping  some of the leaves have become separated
from their complements  but enough remain in the original stitching
to indicate that the book was originally made up in four gatherings 
the first of twelve leaves  the second of ten  the third of ten  and
the fourth of six  although the book is of the size called quarto 
the method of printing must have been page by page  so it is doubtful
that each sheet was folded twice in the usual quarto manner  but
more probable that it was printed four pages to a sheet of paper
approximately       by    inches  which was folded once 

the volume is printed throughout by the xylographic method  that is to
say  each page of text is printed from one wood block which was carved
by hand  along the inner margins of some pages are vertical lines which
were made by the inked edge of the block  and the grain of the wood has
caused striations to appear in the printed portions throughout  the
unevenness of the impression indicates that the pages were printed
in some primitive manner without the help of a conventional press 

the paper  which is one of the distinctive features of most old
oriental books  has been discussed at length by pardo de tavera in
his study of early philippine printing  and we can do no better than
translate the relevant passage in full 


     i have said before that the material composition of our
    books is inferior  the imprints before      were made on a
    paper called by some rice paper  by others silk paper  and
    by still others china paper  according to their taste  it
    is detestable  brittle  without consistency or resistance 
    and was called rice paper because it was supposed to be
    made from that grain  it was the only kind then used in the
    philippines  not only for printing  but for all manner of
    writing  letters  etc   and it is even recorded that in     
    when tobacco was a state monopoly  cigarettes were made with
    this paper  and that the indians and chinese preferred it
     and perhaps they still do  to rag paper or other kinds 
    because of the horrible taste it gives the tobacco 

     in china they commonly made paper of bamboo  but more
    principally from cotton and a plant which travellers have cited
    only by its common name  which they transcribe in various ways 
    calling it  kochu    kotsu   or  kotzu   today it is known
    that this plant is an ulmacea   broussonetia papyrifera  
    from a mash of which they still make cloth in japan  cotton
    paper is superior to it  and naturally more expensive  but
    the paper of inferior quality which was received in manila 
    where nothing was imported regularly but common articles of low
    price  was of  kotsu   as all chinese made paper it was coated
    with alum  the finer  the paper  the thicker  the coating  
    for the purpose of whitening it and making the surface smooth 
    a deplorable business  for it made the paper very moisture
    absorbent  a condition fatal in such a humid climate as
    in these islands  moreover  as the alum used is impure and
    contains a large proportion of iron salts  the humidity and
    weather oxidize it which finally darkens the paper  so that
    philippine books present a coloration which runs the gamut
    of tones from the color of bone to that of dark cinnamon      


because the doctrina christiana  which may well be translated  the
teachings of christianity   contains the basic elements of the religion
which the missionaries were trying to spread among the unbaptized
in the remote regions of the world  it was the most useful handbook
they had  a summary of the contents of the present edition shows the
fundamental character of the work  after a syllabary comes the pater
noster  the primary and most popular prayer of christianity  then
follow the ave maria  credo  salve regina  articles of faith  ten
commandments  commandments of the holy church  sacraments of the holy
church  seven mortal sins  fourteen works of charity  confession
and catechism  here in a small compass is presented the simplest 
most easily learned and most essential tenets of the catholic church 

so useful was the doctrina considered as a guide for those who had
just been  or were about to be  converted that the missionary fathers
placed it in most cases foremost among the books necessary to have
in print in a strange land  it is generally accepted today  although
no extant copy is known  that the first book printed in mexico    
in      was a doctrina in mexican and spanish  recent research has
shown that the second book printed by the pioneer jesuit press at goa 
in india  in      was st  francis xavier s  doutrina christ o     
in the malay language  of which also no copy has yet been located  but
there are copies of the first book to come from a south american press 
another doctrina     printed in the native and spanish languages at
lima in       so the choice of this book as the first to be printed
at manila follows a widespread precedent 

we have then a book  the doctrina christiana  in spanish and tagalog 
corrected by priests of more than one order  and this is important
in tracing the authorship of the work  and printed by the xylographic
method with license at manila at the dominican church of san gabriel
in       so much we get from the title  and in itself it is a fairly
complete story  but from the date of its issue until the present time
that very fundamental information has not been completely recorded 




the bibliographical history


in tracing our clues down through the years  we find at the very
beginning the most valuable evidence which has been uncovered  short
of the book itself  from manila on june           the governor of the
philippines  gomez perez dasmari as  wrote a letter to philip ii of
spain in which he said 


     sire  in the name of your majesty  i have for this once 
    because of the existing great need  granted a license for the
    printing of the doctrinas christianas  herewith enclosed  one
    in the tagalog language  which is the native and best of these
    islands  and the other in chinese  from which i hope great
    benefits will result in the conversion and instruction of the
    peoples of both nations  and because the lands of the indies
    are on a larger scale in everything and things more expensive 
    i have set the price of them at four reales a piece  until your
    majesty is pleased to decree in full what is to be done      


this states unequivocally that two books were printed at manila some
time before june           one of which was the doctrina in tagalog 
and the other the same work in chinese  although we are chiefly
concerned here with the former  the fact that they were produced at
about the same time and probably at the same place makes it necessary
to trace the history of both in order to reconstruct the circumstances
surrounding the production of the one  of the chinese doctrina no
copy has yet come to light  and except for two      references 
there are no records of its existence 

another document     of      verifies the information given in the
letter of dasmari as  differing from it only in one detail  in the
archives of the indies was found a manuscript account of      listing
books written in the philippines  which says 


     there have been printed primers and catechisms of the faith 
    one in spanish and tagalog  which is the native language  and
    the other in chinese  which are being sent to your majesty 
    the tagalog priced at two reales and the chinese at four 
    which is hoped will be of great benefit  


the accounts of the printing of two doctrinas contained in these
documents confirm some of the information of the title and add a bit
more  first  the letter says that the book was printed by permission
given by the governor  which agrees with the  with license  of the
title   for this once because of the existing great need   by a royal
cedula     of september           which was promulgated again on august
          it had been ordered that justices  not consent to or permit
to be printed or sold any book containing material concerning the
indies without having special license sent by our royal council of the
indies   and on may         this was implemented by the further order
 that when any grammar or dictionary of the language of the indies be
made it shall not be published  or printed or used unless it has first
been examined by the bishop and seen by the royal audiencia   this
latter portion was applied specifically to the philippines in a letter
     from philip ii to the audiencia of manila  also dated may   
      to which further reference will be made  it can be gathered
from dasmari as  implied apology that he had never before given such
a license  and  since he had arrived in the philippines in       that
no books had been printed between that time and the licensing of the
doctrinas  it is  moreover  likely that if any similar books had been
printed during the administrations of his predecessors he would have
mentioned the fact as a precedent for acting contrary to the cedulas 

according to dasmari as he had priced the books at four reales a
piece  which followed the regular spanish procedure  under which
books were subject to price control  the governor  it will be noted 
also apologized for the high price he was forced to set  giving
general high prices      as his excuse  yet  while the appraisal of
four reales for this book was high compared to the prevailing scale
in spain  it was not high compared to prices allowed in mexico  on
june         the emperor had given the casa de cromberger  the first
printing house in mexico  permission      to sell books printed there
at seventeen maraved s a sheet  or exactly one half a real  if we
assume that  although the doctrina had been printed page by page 
it was quarto in size and so appraised on the basis of eight pages
to a sheet  we find that the price per sheet comes to about fourteen
maraved s  or less than half a real  however  a contradiction occurs
between the letter of dasmari as and this copy of the doctrina 
supported by the other      document  on the verso of the title  juan
de cuellar       the governor s secretary and the logical person to
sign the official valuation  gives the price as two reales  and the
     account  while agreeing with the letter as far as the chinese
doctrina is concerned  also lists the price of the tagalog doctrina
as two reales  it is impossible to say what caused the discrepancy 
perhaps it was a decision on dasmari as  part to lower the cost 
notwithstanding inflationary values  in order to make the book more
readily available for the natives who were not economically as well
off as the chinese  or it could be that after the letter had been
written it was noticed that the chinese volume was larger than the
tagalog one  and some adjustment made  in any event  the price of this
doctrina was finally set at two reales  making it less than half the
price allowed in mexico fifty years before 

the evidence of the two      documents would seem conclusive with
regard to printing in       but witnesses were not long in appearing
who stated something quite different  the earliest of these was
pedro chirino       a jesuit priest  who came to the philippines with
dasmari as in       he went back to europe in       and while there
had a history of the philippines printed at rome in       in      he
returned to the islands  where he died in       he left unpublished
the manuscript of another and more detailed history  dated      
which contains a most significant passage  where  after speaking of
various early writers in native languages  he continues 


     those who printed first were  p  fr  juan de villanueva of
    the order of st  augustine  who printed  certain little tracts 
    and p  fr  francisco de san joseph of the order of st  dominic
     who printed  larger things of more bulk       


concerning this juan de villanueva      very little indeed is
known  from what has been recorded it would seem that there were two
augustinians of the same name who were in the philippines before
      the first of these was a secular priest who came to ceb 
about       may have taken the augustinian habit some time after his
arrival  and died not long after       the other juan de villanueva 
the date of whose arrival is unknown  was in lubao in       in hagonoy
in       and prior of batangas from      until his death in       of
the two there can be no doubt but that chirino referred to the second
one  but  apart from chirino s note  there is no record anywhere that
works by him existed  nor do the augustinian chroniclers themselves 
except for the modern santiago vela who knew of chirino s citation 
mention him as a linguist or a writer  the only possibility is that
between      and      villanueva had printed some small xylographic
books no copies and no further record of which have appeared 

as for francisco de san joseph  or blancas de san jos  as he is more
frequently called  there are other references to his part in the
establishment of printing in the islands  from information doubtless
obtained from diego aduarte  then in spain  alonso fernandez wrote
in his ecclesiastical history  printed at toledo in      


     father fr  francisco blancas printed in the tagalog language
    and characters a book of our lady of the rosary in the year
          which was the first book that was printed there of
    that or any other material  after this he printed another of
    the sacraments in the language of the philippines  in both
    characters  theirs and ours  from which the greatest results
    have been achieved       


two years later the same author published at madrid an account     
of the miracles performed by the rosary of the virgin  in which he
included a list of  of some writers of the order of st  dominic who
were living in this year        and gave the same information as above 
adding only that the printing took place in bataan 

diego aduarte       whose history of the dominican province of the
philippines is one of the best contemporary ones written  bears out
these statements of which he was most probably the source  aduarte came
to the islands in company with his close friend blancas de san jos 
in       went back to spain as procurator of his order in       and
returned to manila in       staying in the orient until his death in
      his history was continued and edited after his death by a fellow
dominican  domingo gon alez  who had it printed in       summarizing
the life and accomplishments of blancas de san jos   aduarte wrote 


     so he was sent to bataan  which is near there  manila  
    where he learned the language of the indians  called tagalog 
    which is the most common in this country and is used among the
    indians for many leagues around the city  so rapid was his
    study of the language that he began to preach in it within
    three months  and could teach it to others in six     and
    believing that he was the instrument needed to bring the holy
    gospel to the indians  he spared no pains to investigate the
    fitness of their words  the way to use them  and all the rest
    so that he could succeed in mastering it     he wrote many
    books of devotion for them  and since there was no printing
    in these islands  and no one who understood it or who was
    a journeyman printer  he planned to have it done through a
    chinaman  a good christian  who  seeing that the books of
    p  fr  francisco were sure to be of great use  bestowed so
    much care upon this undertaking that he finally succeeded 
    aided by those who told him whatever they knew about it 
    in learning everything necessary to do printing  and he
    printed these books        he  blancas de san jos   printed
    a grammar to learn the tagalog language  a memorial of the
    christian life  a book on the four last things  another on the
    preparation for the communion  a confessionary  another on the
    mysteries of the rosary of our lady  and another to teach the
    tagalog indians the spanish language  and he left many very
    pious and curious works in the language of these indians       


blancas de san jos        as we have noted  came to the philippines in
      he was at abucay in bataan from      until       and then spent
several years in and about manila  preaching to the indians and the
chinese  whose language he also mastered  in      he set out for spain 
but died on the voyage before reaching mexico  of the books which he is
said to have had printed  only two are known to be extant  the  arte
y reglas de la lengva tagala       and the  librong pagaaralan nang
manga tagalog nang uicang castilla        or  libro en qve aprendan
los tagalos  la lengua castellana    both printed at bataan in      
and until the discovery of the present doctrina and the  ordinationes 
of      the earliest surviving philippine imprints known 

we have not cited here in detail the account of juan lopez      in
the fifth part of his history of the dominicans  because  although it
was printed nineteen years before the appearance of aduarte s work 
the information therein contained regarding the philippines was
acknowledgedly obtained from the unfinished manuscript which aduarte
had with him in spain  the pertinent passages add nothing to aduarte s
information  and even the wording is reminiscent of his 

the first suggestion that early philippine books may have been printed
from wood blocks occurred in qu tif and echard s bibliography of
dominican writers printed at paris in       there  after listing
eight works by blancas de san jos   they add 


     he published all these in the philippines with the help
    of a chinese christian using chinese blocks  for in his day
    european typographers had not yet arrived in those islands 
    nor did they have types for their language       


this was an amazing suggestion  for as far as we know the
bibliographers who made it had not actually seen the books  nor is it
entirely true  the first two works listed are two books we know were
printed typographically in       the sixth is  de los mysterios del
rosario de nuestra se ora tagalice   the book referred to by fern ndez
as having been printed in       and generally accepted as being from
movable type  although no copy has been discovered to prove it  and
yet  it is not at all impossible that some time before      blancas de
san jos  had some of his writings printed from blocks  in any event 
the idea  later developed by medina and retana  that xylography was
used before a real printing press was established  may have come from
this not wholly accurate note 

for almost a hundred and fifty years no historian or bibliographer
wrote anything to challenge the basic affirmations of chirino 
fern ndez and aduarte  in the middle of the   th century  lorenzo
hervas y panduro       a jesuit  was forced by the expulsion of the
jesuits from spain to seek refuge in the papal states  and took up
residence at cesena  there he began work on a tremendous universal
history of the spiritual development of man  into which he wove the
results of his philosophical  social and linguistic studies  these
last were of particular importance  and hervas is regarded as the true
founder of the science of linguistics and comparative philology  in
     he published the eighteenth volume of his massive work  the
 origine  formazione  meccanismo  ed armonia degl  idiomi   in which
he printed a tagalog ave maria as written in       with the note 


     the ave maria in the tagalog of      is to be read in the
    tagalog spanish doctrina christiana which was printed in
    tagalog and roman characters by the dominican fathers in
    their printing house at manila in the year            


in      he finished his twenty first volume   saggio pratico       
which was another philological study  including the pater noster
in over three hundred languages and dialects  among them tagalog 
again from the      doctrina  here  then  is ample proof that a copy
of this book was known to hervas in       and the only information
which his loose transcription of the title failed to give was that
the volume was  corrected by members of the orders   that it was
printed with license  and that it was printed at san gabriel 

at the beginning of the following century two german scholars  familiar
with hervas  writings  noted the      doctrina  franz carl alter      
in his monograph on the tagalog language  printed the ave maria from
the text which had appeared in       and johann christoph adelung 
     in his  mithridates   a comprehensive study of languages 
included the tagalog pater noster from the  saggio pratico  of
      the latter also listed in a short bibliography of the tagalog
language the doctrina of       giving exactly the same information
about it that hervas had  neither of these men apparently saw a copy
of the book  limiting themselves to extracts from hervas  but they
perpetuated an earlier reference of the utmost importance 

shortly after the two germans published their notices of the     
doctrina an entry appeared of a book printed at manila in       jos 
mariano beristain y sousa  a learned mexican writer  issued in
        a bibliography of spanish american books  in which he listed
alphabetically the authors  giving a short biography of each and
adding a list of his works  under juan de qui ones we find 


      arte y vocabulario de la lengua tagala   imp  en manila 
               


no specific authority is given for this entry  but in his sketch of
the life of qui ones beristain cited as sources  juan de grijalva 
nicol s antonio  gaspar de san agustin  and jos  sicardo  it would
seem logical that one of these must have mentioned such a work as
printed in manila in       but in tracing down the sources no such
precise notice is found 

grijalva simply said that qui ones  concerned himself with tagalog and
made a vocabulary and grammar of it        antonio      referred to
grijalva  and carried the matter no further  san agustin  describing
the franciscan chapter of       wrote 


     it was determined moreover in this chapter that p  fr  juan
    de qui ones  prior of the convent of taal in tagalos  and
    fr  diego de ochoa  prior of bacolor in pampanga  should
    compose and fashion grammars  dictionaries  and confessionaries
    in the two languages  respectively tagalog and pampanga  in
    which they had ventured  which they executed very promptly
    and well  and these were of great use to those who came to
    these islands  for they had these by which they could study
    the languages       


later  san agustin  again mentioning qui ones  referred to grijalva 
and added as an additional source for his information t mas de
herrera  sicardo      added nothing new  herrera  not cited directly
by beristain  may however have been the source from which the  imp   of
his entry came  herrera wrote 


     he  qui ones  was the first to have learned the tagalog
    language of which he published a grammar and dictionary as
    an aid to the ministers of the gospel  


if beristain read this  he may have been misled by the latin of
 published         in lucem edidit   which may indeed mean printed
and published  but also means quite properly published in the sense
of written in manuscript and copied and circulated  we agree with
schilling      that this latter meaning was the one intended  one
other statement that qui ones  works were printed may derive from
the same misunderstanding  about the year      pedro bello wrote an
account  still in manuscript and unpublished  of the writings of the
augustinians  his remarks on qui ones  first printed by santiago vela
      we believe are only an extension of herrera s  in lucem edidit  

this same confusion in terminology has been used      to support
beristain s claim by introducing as evidence the letter of philip ii of
may          salazar  the bishop of manila  probably shortly after the
synod of       had written the king a letter  now unfortunately lost 
in which he spoke of a decision to standardize linguistic works  in
answer to the bishop  the following letter in the form of a royal
cedula was sent 


     to the president and judges of my royal audiencia situated
    in the city of manila in the philippine islands   it has been
    told me on behalf of don fray domingo de salazar  bishop of
    that place  that it was agreed that no priest might make a
    grammar or vocabulary  and that if it were made it might not
    be published before being examined and approved by the said
    bishop  because otherwise there would result great differences
    and disagreements in the doctrine  and this having been seen
    by my council of the indies  it was agreed that i should
    order this my cedula which decrees that when any grammar or
    vocabulary be made it shall not be published or used unless
    it has first been examined by the said bishop and seen by
    this audencia       


here again the word  publicado  is brought forth to prove that the
letter referred to printed works  but here again the term is equally
applicable to manuscript works in common use and generally available 

further evidence that there was no printing as early as      is to be
found in a letter      from juan de plasencia  a tagalist of great
renown  to the king  dated from manila  june           in which he
reported on the state of missionary work in china and japan  and added
that he had written a grammar and a declaration of the whole doctrina
in the most common language of the philippines  and that he was then
making a dictionary  concluding by asking the king to send decrees
ordering those works to be printed in mexico at the expense of the
exchequer  is it likely that plasencia would have so written if an
 arte y vocabulario  had been printed four years earlier  furthermore 
san antonio  recording the book on the customs and rites of the indians
written by plasencia at the request of the governor santiago de vera 
and dated october           said that it was not printed  because
printing houses had not yet come to this country       

we then conclude with regard to beristain s entry  that although
there existed in manuscript an  arte y vocabuldrio tagalo  by juan de
qui ones  there is no evidence of the existence of any book printed
for him from wood blocks or in type  santiago de vela      suggests
the possibility that there might have been a xylographic  arte  of
      but schilling      questions this in the face of the complete
lack of reference to such a printed work by any   th or   th century
writer  and the tenuous notices of bello and beristain  yet to say
categorically that no such work was printed would be foolhardy in the
face of the scanty early records and the appearance of this doctrina 
a single copy of which has just been discovered 

the first important work devoted solely to the early history of the
philippine press was by t h  pardo de tavera  who in      published
his study of printing and engraving in the philippines  he there
recorded a      doctrina  but adamantly refused to accept it on the
hearsay evidence of others  his account is valuable because it shows
that there may have been a copy of the doctrina in java in      
and so we quote from it at some length 


     a learned dutch orientalist  dr  j  brandes  wrote me in     
    from bali boeleleng  java  telling me that in      at manila
    there was printed a doctrina christiana in spanish tagalog 
    with the proper characters for the latter language  other
    orientalists  at the last congress in london in       gave
    me the same information  nonetheless  no one told me where
    he had read such a thing  nor much less that he had managed
    to see such a book  although inspecting a rare book which
    i acquired in paris  alter   ueber die tagalische sprache  
    vienna         i saw that the author cited such a doctrina
    christiana and said that he knew of its existence through abb 
    hervas  this is an error  and without doubt such a doctrina was
    in manuscript  because in       he should have said       there
    was no press in manila nor in any part of the archipelago 
    and today we know for certain and positively that the first
    book issued there appeared in            


pardo de tavera was the first to call attention to alter  and through
him to hervas  and in all probability the orientalists at the london
congress had seen the doctrina cited by one of these or adelung  but he
rejects that evidence in no uncertain terms  mitigating somewhat his
assurance  he speaks following the above quoted passage of printing
in china  and differentiates between xylographic and typographic
printing  and since he was obviously thinking in terms of printing
on a press with movable type his conclusions are not too extreme 

in      appeared jos  toribio medina s  la imprenta en manila   which
was up to then the best  most complete and most scholarly work on early
philippine printing  and is today with its subsequent additions and
corrections the standard bibliography of the subject  there medina
cited most of the authorities we have already quoted  the letter of
dasmari as  fern ndez   historia eclesiastica   aduarte  adelung 
beristain and pardo de tavera  then  basing his conclusions strongly
on the dasmari as letter and the note of adelung  he listed     
as number one in his bibliography the doctrina of      in spanish
and tagalog  and as number two the doctrina in spanish and chinese
of the same year  this is a verdict which has stood the test of
time  and one that is just now confirmed by the discovery of the
book itself  two points  however  in his survey should be noted  in
his discussion of the printing and the authorship medina does not
emphasize the dominican origin of the book  although he does say that
 it does not appear bold to us to suppose that the imprint of these
doctrinas ought to be the hospital of san gabriel in this village
 binondo         and faithfully copies adelung s imprint notice   in
the dominican printing house   in his listing of the book  the other
point is that he says in his introduction and repeats in his entry
that the doctrina had a latin as well as spanish and tagalog texts 
an erroneous translation of adelung s  mit lateinische und tagalische
schrift   he was hesitant as are all bibliographers  who must perforce
record the probable existence of a book a copy of which they have
never seen  in committing himself as to whether it was printed from
blocks or from type or by a combination of the two methods 

more positive and more succinct than medina was t e  retana whose
earlier researches      into the history of the philippines medina
acknowledgedly made use of  and who in      published his  la imprenta
en filipinas  adiciones y observaciones a la imprenta en manila   he
took the material of medina  added the evidence of chirino and
plasencia  and resummarized the problem  the letter of dasmari as
showed conclusively that a doctrina was printed in       chirino said
that the first two whose works were printed were juan de villanueva and
blancas de san jos   fern ndez stated positively that the first book
printed in the philippines was the book of our lady of the rosary by
blancas de san jos  printed at bataan in       aduarte supported this
without mentioning a title  place or date of printing  if we are to
accept all these statements as incontrovertible  how can the apparent
contradictions be reconciled  the answer had already been hinted at 
but retana solved the problem with amazing acumen  and arrived at
four conclusions  which are here printed in his own words 


     a  that the doctrinas of       though printed at manila  were
    not executed in type  but by the so called xylographic method 

    b  that the initiative for the establishment of  typography 
    is owed to p  fr  francisco blancas de san jos  

    c  that the first  typographer  was the chinese christian
    juan de vera at the instigation of the said father san jos  

    d  that the first  typographical  printing of this dominican
    author is of the year            


it is not difficult to say with the book itself in front of us 
that it is an example of xylographic printing  but it was a great
feat on the part of retana  who had never seen a copy  to resolve
apparently irreconcilable differences of opinion on the part of
several unquestioned authorities by deducing that it was all a
matter of semantics  what did  printing  mean  as for the sprite of
     introduced by beristain  retana dismissed it on the grounds of
insufficient evidence  in a word  he concluded that the first book
issued in the philippines was a doctrina printed from wood blocks
in      

all subsequent writers on the subject have derived their information
from the sources we have already mentioned  and to a great degree
have been influenced by the findings of medina and retana  the
rev  thomas cooke middleton      in      confessed that he did not
know what the first book printed was  pardo de tavera maintained his
old intransigence  when in the introduction to his bibliography for
the library of congress in      he wrote that medina s affirmation
that printing took place in       loses all validity in the face of
the categorical statement of f  alonso fern ndez        medina did
not comment further in his  adiciones y ampliaciones       of      
yet when the same year p rez and g emes      published their additions
to and continuation of medina  bringing his bibliography down to
      they resurrected the       arte   but added no new evidence
to prove their case  blair and robertson  in their tremendous 
collective history of the philippines  did not include a list of
philippine imprints in their bibliography       but referred readers
to medina and retana with whom they agreed  to celebrate the three
hundredth anniversary of typographical printing in the philippines
artigas y cuerva      wrote a study which emphasized the part played
by blancas de san jos   but did not deny the existence of the     
doctrina  retana      in      brought his work on the subject up to
date  but retained all his major conclusions  in palau s standard
bibliography of spanish books we find the doctrinas called  the two
earliest books known to have been printed in manila        finally  the
most thorough recent work on the subject is to be found in schilling s
     survey of the early history of the philippine press published in
      there is little that can be added to the evidence uncovered by
these modern writers  but the appearance of the book itself enables
us to say with certainty some things which they were able only to
surmise  however  as regards the authorship and the circumstances and
place of printing we are able  from the information given on the title 
to carry the investigation somewhat further 




the authorship of the text


the title tells us that the book was  corrected  by the priests of
more than one order  and since it was printed by the dominicans 
we can assume that the ultimate responsibility for the preparation
of the text in consultation with friars of other orders also lay
in their hands  our problem then is to discover what texts were
available to them in      and who were the priests who formed the
editorial board  we have included in this study also the origins of
the chinese text  for the two doctrinas appeared at the same time 
and as we shall see the same dominicans were probably responsible for
the production and preparation of both the tagalog and the chinese
texts  during the period under discussion there were priests of four
orders active in the islands  and so we shall speak in turn of the
augustinian  franciscan  jesuit and dominican fathers who might have
written or worked on the doctrinas printed in      



the augustinians


the first priests to come to the philippines were six augustinians
who accompanied legazpi on the expedition which in      established
the first permanent european settlement in the islands  among them
was martin de rada  who was one of the most important and influential
priests during the early days of the spanish colony  and who was the
first linguist of note to work in the philippines  the first language
he learned was visayan       native to the island of ceb  where the
spaniards first landed  but he also learned chinese  in may      he
was elected provincial of his order  and in june      he went with
jer nimo mar n  as ambassador to china  being  the first spaniard
who entered into that said kingdom        in preparation for the
voyage  we are told by gonz lez de mendoza  whose famous and popular
history of china first printed in      derives in a great measure from
information brought back by rada  that rada  began with great care  
studie to learne that language  chinese   the which he learned in
few daies    did make thereof a dictionarie        rada was then not
only the first to write in visayan  but also the first to compile a
chinese dictionary  and more important still brought back with him
to manila from china many books of which mendoza gives a list      
these books  printed in the usual chinese method from wood blocks 
could have provided models for the spaniards in the philippines who
lacked european facilities for printing  and they may have given
birth to the idea which resulted in the xylographic doctrinas 

within the first few years several more augustinian fathers     
arrived whose linguistic accomplishments are briefly noted by the
historians  but while these men were certainly pioneers in the speaking
of tagalog and chinese  they are not recorded as having written in
the language  according to cano       the first tagalog grammar was
written by agustin de alburquerque  and retana      considered him
one of the possible authors of the present doctrina  this friar
reached the philippines in       accompanied rada on his second
expedition to china in       was elected provincial in       and died
in       however  there is no early record saying that alburquerque
wrote any linguistic work  the statement was not made until the   th
century  and in contradiction juan de medina  who wrote in      
said that juan de qui ones  made a grammar and lexicon of the tagal
language  which was the first to make a start in the rules of its
mode of speech        furthermore  in the official acts      of the
augustinian province we find that on august          alburquerque
as provincial of the order commissioned qui ones to write a grammar 
dictionary and confessionary in the tagalog language  the conclusions
of santiago de vela      are that it is doubtful that alburquerque
wrote any linguistic works  and if he did they were liable to have
been rough preliminary studies      upon which the texts of qui ones
were based  in view of the lack of positive contemporary evidence
     we believe that alburquerque may be eliminated except as the
instigator of such works  and we return again to juan de qui ones 

in so far as qui ones      was the author of a grammar and dictionary
claimed to have been printed at manila in       we have shown what
various writers have said  and though we must conclude that the work
was probably not printed  it is certain that he wrote in the tagalog
language  agustin maria de castro      said  although no earlier
writers support it  that qui ones actually presented a grammar 
dictionary and doctrina in tagalog at the synod of      for its
approval  our total information about this augustinian linguist boils
down to these essentials  that he did write a grammar and dictionary
of tagalog about          which may have been the earliest written
in the philippines  that he may have presented these and a doctrina
at the synod of      which approved juan de plasencia s works  that
there is no concrete evidence that any of these works were printed 
and that qui ones  works which were extant in manuscript in     
might have been consulted in the preparation of the present doctrina 

another member of the order of st  augustine who might have been
able to participate in the editing of the      doctrinas was diego
mu oz  mu oz came to the islands in       and died in       of him
san agustin writes 


     moreover in this year        the ministry for the sangleys
    was founded in the convent of tondo  and p  fr  diego mu oz
    was named as its special minister  he devoted particular
    zeal to the study of the chinese language  and preached in
    it with much elegance  and all the sangleys who were going
    to be baptized  and there were many  had recourse to this
    ministry  and the teaching was continued with much vigilance
    and care  and there never lacked a religious of our order
    to apply himself to such holy work  from the time we came to
    this land  as our original records of the province prove       


to him is also attributed      a volume of manuscript panegyric sermons
in tagalog  and because of this and his work at tondo he may have
been consulted by the dominicans  we also mention lorenzo de le n 
     who arrived in       spent twelve years in the provinces  wrote
a book called the  estrella del mar  in tagalog  and died in      
and might also have helped 




the franciscans


although the first franciscans did not arrive in the philippines
until june           the writings of the linguists of that order
are more fully recorded  among the earliest was juan de plasencia
who  the franciscans claim  wrote the first tagalog grammar  he was
fortunate in meeting soon after his arrival miguel de talavera      
who had come with his parents on the expedition of legazpi  miguel 
then quite young  became in a manner of speaking the disciple of
plasencia  and while the father taught him latin  he in turn taught
plasencia the elements of tagalog which he had picked up  for two years
plasencia ministered in the provinces of tayabas  laguna  and bulacan
where he used and perfected his knowledge of the native language  on
may           when the provincial pedro de alfaro left for china 
he named plasencia acting provincial during his absence  a reference
to the earliest linguistic writings of the franciscans occurs in an
account by santa in s of the chapter meeting held in the convent of
los angeles in july       which was presided over by plasencia 


     the third and last thing that was determined in this chapter
    was that a grammar and dictionary of the tagalog language
    should be made and a translation of the doctrina christiana
    completed  and since fr  juan de plasencia  the president of
    this same chapter  excelled all in the language  he was given
    this responsibility  and he accepted it  and immediately set to
    work  and then after great study  much lack of sleep and care 
    together with fervent prayers and other spiritual duties 
    of not little importance in the good profit of such work 
    he reduced the language to a grammar  made a catechism 
    a very full dictionary  and various translations       


but the most important record of his writings is contained in
the description of the synod called by bishop salazar in       in
march        domingo de salazar  the first bishop of manila and the
philippines  had arrived  the problems which faced him were manifold 
particularly those of ecclesiastical jurisdiction  the treatment of the
natives by government administrators  and the means by which the gospel
could best be spread  a synod was called to resolve these points  one
matter of the utmost importance was the approval of standard tagalog
texts  and juan de la concepcion gives the following account of what
transpired in this connection 


     his excellency presided at the meetings  at them the most
    learned topics were discussed and the most learned persons
    were present  the dominican father salvatierra  the most
    outstanding scholars among the augustinians and franciscans 
    the jesuit fathers sede o and sanchez  and the licentiate
    don diego vasquez de mercado as dean of the new cathedral  at
    this convention or diocesan synod it was discussed whether the
    indians were to be ministered to in their native language  or
    if they would be obliged to learn spanish  and it was decided
    to instruct them in their native tongue  the divine office 
    the doctrina christiana  which father fr  juan de plasencia
    had translated into the tagalog language  was approved  his
    work  the  arte y vocabuldrio tagalo   was judged most useful
    because of the ease by which it permitted an understanding
    and thorough knowledge of so foreign a language       


the already quoted account of santa in s continues with a similar
description of the synod  and says that when the problem of teaching
the natives was brought up only plasencia could resolve it 


     since  having seen his catechism and the translation which he
    had made in tagalog of the grammar and dictionary  those who
    were at the synod and understood anything of the language could
    do nothing but admire the fitness of the terms  their efficacy
    and strength  and they said that  without the particular
    help of heaven  it seemed impossible that in so short a time
    and with so few years in the country he could have done such
    excellent work  and then  having approved them  they ordered
    that various copies be made  particularly of the translation
    of the doctrina  so that with them and with no other would
    the ministers teach the indians  and so it was approved 
    in order that there might be uniformity in all parts of the
    tagalog country  this translation is that which has come down
    to this day  except that it is more polished       


it must have been shortly after the handbooks of plasencia received
the seal of ecclesiastical approval that salazar wrote the king
speaking of the action taken  and got back in answer the cedula  quoted
before  giving the bishop and audiencia the right of censorship over
such works  the question of chronological precedence      between
qui ones and plasencia is not important  for the specific approval
of plasencia s texts by the synod  attended by qui ones himself 
shows that plasencia s books were accepted  and in conformity with
the ruling of the synod would have been the only texts allowed to be
used generally in the philippines 

another reference to writers in the native tongues in an anonymous
manuscript of      introduces the names of other linguists 


     the first missionaries left many writings in the tagalog
    and bicol languages  the best of which are those left by
    fathers fray juan de oliver  fray juan de plasencia  fray
    miguel de talavera  fray diego de la asuncion  and fray
    ger nimo monte  mention is here made of the above fathers
    because they were the first masters of the tagalog language 
    and since their writings are so common and so well received
    by all the orders  they have not been printed  because they
    are voluminous  and there are no arrangements in this kingdom
    for printing so much       


miguel de talavera we have spoken of before  that he helped plasencia
in the compilation of his earliest works in tagalog is clear  and
to him in part must be attributed the miracle of the production by
plasencia of the texts  in so short a time and with so few years
in the country   mart nez says specifically that talavera  was the
first interpreter among our priests  and greatly helped fr  juan
de plasencia in the composition of the  arte y vocabulario        
juan de oliver was in somewhat the same relationship to plasencia 
but instead of helping with the initial attempts  he carried on from
where plasencia left off  oliver came to the philippines on the same
expedition which brought bishop salazar in       according to huerta
     he worked in various tagalog villages  and mastered the tagalog
and bicol languages  in which he wrote twenty two works  which huerta
lists  of these three are of particular interest to us  the first
entry says that he  corrected the tagalog grammar written by fr  juan
de plasencia  and added the adverbs and particles        the second
that  he perfected and augmented the spanish tagalog dictionary 
written by the said fr  juan de plasencia   and the sixteenth lists
a  catecismo de doctrina cristiana esplicado  

several authors  attempting to establish the priority of qui ones 
dictionary  question the existence of one by plasencia at the synod
of      in the face of his own statement in      that he  was then
making a dictionary        to us there seems to be no inconsistency 
if plasencia in      was referring to a revision  unquestionably
made with his knowledge and help  by juan de oliver  in short  it
is reasonable to assume that plasencia  burdened with administrative
duties from      to       during which time he was custodian of his
order  secured the aid of oliver in reediting and continuing his
linguistic studies  plasencia died in      

the other two franciscans listed by the anonymous historian of
     are elsewhere recorded as having written various works in
tagalog  to both diego de la asuncion      and ger nimo montes y
escamillo      were attributed grammars and dictionaries  and the
latter also wrote a  devotional tagalog   said to have been printed
at manila in       in speaking of these early linguistic texts  it is
not necessary to believe that each was a completely original work 
but rather that they were based upon a recognized model  which was
at first the talavera plasencia oliver text  and that the individual
missionaries used their experience in the field to produce  as it
were  new editions  that this was the case is borne out by the notes
of pablo rojo to his bibliography of plasencia where speaking of the
grammar and dictionary he says that  perfected by other missionaries 
they have been the base for such grammars and dictionaries of tagalog
as have been written  but in the form in which they came from the
hands of their author  they have not come down to us        more
important still is rojo s statement      that he found a portion of
plasencia s doctrina which had been believed lost  and from which he
quotes the pater noster  since he does not say where the manuscript
was or how it was known to be plasencia s text  we cannot put too
much reliance on the statement  but the text as there printed  while
similar to that of the present doctrina  is not identical 



the jesuits


before passing on to the dominicans we shall mention briefly the
linguists of the society of jesus  in the early days there were not
many jesuits in the philippines  however  there were some linguists
among them  chiefly of the visayan tongue  in which they are said to
have printed a doctrina      as early as       limiting ourselves to
a note of those who knew chinese and tagalog  we find that the first
mentioned by chirino as an outstanding master of one of these was
francisco almerique  who arrived with santiago de vera in       shortly
thereafter he  began the study of the chinese language in his zeal
to aid in the conversion of the many chinese who came to manila and
whom we in the philippines call sangleys        and colin says  his
principal occupation was with the tagalog indians  being the first of
the company to learn their language        nothing further is said of
his accomplishments in these languages  but his knowledge would have
been available in       for he was then still active in the islands 

chirino himself landed at manila in      shortly after dasmari as 
and went almost immediately to taytay where he learned tagalog and
was joined in      by martin henriquez  at the time juan de oliver
was preaching in that district  and it is exceedingly probable that
he helped the newcomers with the language  for chirino speaks of him
in terms of highest praise  henriquez  learned the language in three
months and in six wrote a catechism in it  a confessionary  and a
book of sermons for all the gospels of the year in the said idiom  
     but he died on february         at taytay  how thoroughly chirino
himself had grasped the fundamentals of tagalog is evident from his
three chapters      on the language and letters of the natives in
which he prints the ave maria in tagalog and reproduces the tagalog
alphabet  its first appearance in a european publication  but chirino 
who remained in the provinces until       would have mentioned his
participation and that of henriquez in the doctrina of       so we
record them as possible but not probable consultants 



the dominicans


had aduarte written that the first books printed at manila were two
doctrinas issued by the dominicans at san gabriel in       and given
some details of their production  we could conclude our study with
a quotation from him  but nowhere does he mention them  in fact 
his inference was that the first book was that printed for blancas
de san jos   and yet we know that this doctrina preceded anything
that blancas de san jos  could have written  since he did not come
to the philippines until       we can assume  as retana did  that
by printing aduarte meant printing from movable type  but this does
not explain away the fact that aduarte  who recorded in detail events
of far less significance  did not speak of the doctrinas at all  the
best  and it is a most unsatisfactory best  that we can do is ascribe
the omission to the frailty of man  and record that there is no notice
of the dominican doctrina of      in the most complete contemporary
dominican history of the philippines 

the first members of the order of st  dominic      to land in the
philippines were bishop salazar and his assistant  christoval de
salvatierra  but they were fully occupied with the administration of
the bishopric and could not devote themselves to regular missionary
work  it was not until july          that working dominican
missionaries came  then fifteen      under the leadership of juan de
castro arrived  and established the first dominican province     
of the philippines and china  thus consummating the hope expressed
as early as           

in consultation with the other orders it was decided that the
dominicans should be given the ministry of the territories of
pangasinan and bataan  which had theretofore been spiritually
exploited by few priests  almost immediately  on september          
the vicariate of bataan was founded and settled  in speaking of it 
aduarte stressed the importance of a knowledge of the language of the
natives  which there would have been tagalog  to the success of the
mission  domingo de nieva  one of the four members of the mission 
learned it rapidly and well  and soon began to preach to the indians
in their own tongue  his aptitude for languages and its usefulness to
the dominicans must have been very great  for aduarte in listing the
priests who originally volunteered in spain makes few comments about
individuals  but of nieva he remarks that he  was afterwards of great
importance because of the great ease and skill with which he learned
languages  whether indian or chinese        unfortunately nieva was
only a deacon  and so could not hear confession  a fact which was
greatly deplored  because during that first year no other priest
mastered the language sufficiently well to do it  but in september
     he reached the requisite age and was ordained  about that time
the friars in bataan  one had died and another was ailing  were joined
by juan de la cruz   who  being young  succeeded very well with the
language         and also succeeded in surviving the climate 

early in      juan cobo       arrived from mexico  shortly thereafter 
on june           the dominican chapter held its first convocation  it
elected juan de castro the first provincial  adopted the general
ordinances       already made in mexico  gave the convent at manila
the title of priory  and designated as parts of the province four
vicariates  of primary importance was the appointment then of juan
cobo to the mission for the chinese 

from the very earliest days of the spanish occupation of manila 
the governors had had trouble with the chinese and sangleys       
these people had long conducted a profitable trade between china
and the philippines  and many had settled permanently near manila 
while others stayed there regularly between trading voyages  the
chinese merchants were in full control of the shops of the city  and
so monopolized retail trade that the early governors legislated      
against them to give the spaniards a chance to establish themselves
in business  in      there were as many as seven thousand of them in
and around manila 

no one had objected to the pangasinan and bataan assignments  but when
it was suggested that the dominicans also assume the responsibility for
the ministry over the chinese and sangleys in the suburbs of manila 
the augustinians vehemently resented what they considered an invasion
of their prior rights  aduarte omits any account of a disagreement 
merely saying that since the chinese had had no one to minister to
them the dominicans assumed that responsibility  but in a letter      
from the licentiate gaspar de ayala to philip ii  dated from manila 
july           full details of the squabble are given  from this source
we learn that the augustinians had a convent in the village of tondo
in the chinese district  there they had ministered to the natives in
their own language  but had rather neglected their chinese speaking
parishioners  consequently after the arrival of the dominicans the
audiencia passed an ordinance requiring that the bishop appoint
ministers of one order to administer to the chinese in their own
language within thirty days  to meet the deadline the augustinians
began to study chinese at breakneck speed  but when the bishop came
to tondo to hear one of the friars  who was supposed to know the
language  preach in it  there was some trouble as a result of which
the augustinian would not  or indeed could not  preach  naturally 
when it was decided to award the territory to the dominicans  the
augustinians accused the bishop of favoritism towards his own order 

the whole situation is best described in the report on the chinese
made by salazar to the king on june          


     when i arrived in this land  i found that in a village called
    tondo  which is not far from this city  there being a river
    between  lived many sangleys  of whom some were christians 
    but the larger part infidels  in this city were also some
    shops kept by sangleys  who lived here in order to sell the
    goods which they kept here year by year  these sangleys were
    scattered among the spaniards  with no specific place assigned
    to them  until don gonzalo ronquillo allotted them a place
    to live in  and to be used as a silk market  which is here
    called  pari n    of four large buildings  here  many shops
    were opened  commerce increased  and more sangleys came to this
    city     when i came  all the sangleys were almost forgotten 
    and relegated to a corner  no thought was taken for their
    conversion  because no one knew their language or undertook
    to learn it on account of its great difficulty  and because
    the religious who lived here were too busy with the natives of
    these islands  although the augustinian religious had charge
    of the sangleys of tondo  they did not minister to or instruct
    them in their own language  but in that of the natives or this
    land  thus the sangley christians living here  were christians
    only in name  knowing no more of christianity than if they
    had never accepted it     then i appealed to all religious
    orders to appoint some one of their religious to learn the
    language and take charge of the sangleys  although all of them
    showed a desire to do so  and some even began to learn it 
    yet no one succeeded  and the sangleys found themselves with
    no one to instruct them and take up their conversion with the
    necessary earnestness  until  in the year eighty seven  god
    brought to these islands the religious of st  dominic        


so we find  as the dominicans undertook their mission  a large
settlement of chinese  including both a settled and a floating
population  concentrated in the pari n  across the pasig river from
the main city of manila 

the dominating figure of the chinese mission from the time of his
arrival in the philippines was juan cobo  in a letter  written by him
from the pari n of manila  july           probably to ecclesiastical
authorities in mexico  he gives an account of the early days of
the mission 


     the order took a site next to this pari n  since there was
    not a single house between santo domingo and the pari n  and
    because of this opportunity the order presently charged
    itself with the chinese  both christians and infidels  and
    upon p  fr  miguel de benavides and p  fr  juan maldonado was
    imposed the responsibility for the care of the chinese and for
    learning their language  p  fr  miguel was less occupied with
    other matters than fr  juan maldonado  so that he progressed
    in the language enough to begin to catechize in it  this was
    the first year the order was in manila 

     presently in the second year when i came  the order moved
    p  fr  miguel and myself into another separate house at the
    other edge of the pari n  so that there stood between santo
    domingo and san gabriel  which is the name of this church
    of the chinese  the whole of the pari n of the sangleys  and
    there a poor little church was built under the protection of
    san gabriel  to whom it fell by lot  and a poor house where
    we two lived  we entered into it at the beginning of september
          this was the first church for the chinese built  and we
    believe that there is today not another parish church  for
    the chinese  but that     and p  fr  miguel catechized them
    and preached to them in their chinese language  and taught
    the doctrine in it  i myself did not yet know the language 
    but the lord has been served  so that in a short time i
    progressed in it        


the account of aduarte is not so accurate in some details  but
it supplies others not mentioned by cobo  the first mission which
benavides and maldonado  or de san pedro martyr as he was later known 
built was near the village of tondo  in a new settlement specially
founded for christian chinese  called baybay  and it was named for our
lady of the purification  the second mission which was established
by benavides and cobo was at first a palm leaf hut  the name of san
gabriel was decided upon by making lots with the names of various
saints on them and then drawing  san gabriel came out three times in
a row  and  all were persuaded that the lord was pleased to have the
patronage belong to this holy archangel   soon  because of the good
works of the fathers who established a hospital there for the care
of the sick and poor  the demands upon the hut became so great that
a larger building was planned  at first it was to have been erected
on the site of the hut  but the inhabitants protested that a stone
building so near native houses might do them great damage in the
event of an earthquake  so the friars went to the other side of the
river  and there built a temporary building of wood which was later
completed in stone  it was here then that the doctrina was printed 
in the church of san gabriel  near the pari n of manila  at the edge
of the chinese settlement 

under the care of benavides and cobo the mission flourished 
and the two fathers became increasingly proficient in the chinese
language  when the provincial juan de castro began making preparations
for an inspection tour of his chinese vicariate in       he chose as
his companion miguel de benavides  the account of the events leading
up to this expedition is given in the already quoted letter of salazar
on the chinese 


     of the dominican religious who came to these islands  four
    are engaged in ministering to the sangleys  two of these
    four officiate in the church of san gabriel  which  together
    with the house where the religious live  stands close to the
    pari n  another church with its house is on the promontory
    of baybay  near tondo  which a river divides  separating it
    from manila  two of the four have learned the language of
    the sangleys so well  and one of these two how to write also
     which is the most difficult part of the language   that the
    sangleys wonder at their knowledge     after due consideration
    of the matter  the dominican fathers and myself decided that
    it was necessary to go to china     thus we decided upon the
    departure  sending at present no more than two religious  fray
    miguel de benavides  who was the first to learn the language
    of the sangleys  and father juan de castro  who came as vicar
    of the religious and who was made provincial here  we preferred
    these two  as one is well acquainted with the language  and the
    other is much loved and esteemed by the sangleys on account of
    his venerable gray locks and blessed old age  and we know that
    in that land old people are much respected and revered        


they sailed on may           but juan de castro before he left
appointed cobo acting superior of the province with full authority
during his absence  and in the latter s place as head of the chinese
mission sent juan de san pedro martyr 

there is no doubt but that at this time benavides and cobo were
the two outstanding chinese linguists among the spaniards in
the philippines  to benavides has been attributed       a chinese
dictionary  and schilling       uses the already quoted letter of cobo
to prove that he also wrote a doctrina in chinese  but  granting that
such works were written by him  there is no evidence that they were
written in chinese characters  and not in chinese transliterated into
roman letters  the available evidence points to the fact that cobo
was the only one who could then write in chinese characters  salazar
in his above quoted letter had said that  one of these two  have
learned  how to write also   and in the same letter he continued 
 fray juan cobo  the dominican religious  who  as i have said before 
knows the language of the sangleys and their writing  and who is most
esteemed by them  is sending to your majesty a book  one of a number
brought to him from china         further witness to cobo s amazing
knowledge of chinese writing is given by aduarte 


     he knew three thousand chinese characters  each different
    from all the rest  for the chinese have no definite number
    of letters nor alphabet     he translated a number  of
    chinese books   for like those of seneca  though they are
    the work of heathens  they contain many profound sayings
    like ours  he taught astrology to some of them whom he found
    capable of learning  and to bring them by all means to their
    salvation also taught them some trades that are necessary
    among spaniards  but which  not being used by the chinese 
    they did not know  such as painting images  binding books 
    cutting and sewing clothes  and such things  doing all to
    win men to god        


finally  as a more definite proof that cobo could have been the
author of the chinese doctrina of       we have the record       of a
 catecismo de la doctrina cristiana en lengua china  written by him 
as well as many other works in chinese 

in may       then  the most accomplished sinologist yet to work in
the philippines was in charge of the dominican province   his first
act   wrote aduarte   was to strengthen the ministry to the chinese by
appointing to it father domingo de nieva  a priest of great virtue and
very able  which was tremendously important there  and one who best
mastered that language  as well as that of the indians in which he
had had experience  and he worked in both of them  and wrote much
to the great advantage of those who came after him         it is
surprising that no previous writer has emphasized the presence of
domingo de nieva  whose proficiency in tagalog we have already noted 
at san gabriel during the years when the printing of the doctrinas
must have been planned and executed  his works are cited by fern ndez 
      and after giving a summary of his career  aduarte added 


     he wrote much in the language of the indians and other things
    in the language of the chinese for whom he had printed in
    their language and characters a memorial upon the christian
    life  with other brief tracts of prayer and meditation  in
    preparation for the holy sacraments  of confession and the
    sacred communion  he was an enemy of sloth  and so worked
    much in chinese  in which he wrote a practically new grammar
    of the chinese language  a vocabulary  a manual of confession
    and many sermons  in order that those who had to learn this
    language might find it less difficult        


medina       records these various works as manila imprints of unknown
date  and to this indefinite information about them we can add nothing
positive  however  it is apparent that some time before       when
nieva died on his way to mexico  he had had books printed  and since
they were in chinese they must have been printed from wood blocks 
for at that early date it would have been impossible to have cast the
number of characters necessary to print in chinese with movable type 

with nieva was maldonado  or san pedro martyr  he had been one of the
first associates of benavides in the first chinese mission at baybay 
but after the arrival of cobo he had been sent by order of the first
chapter to pangasinan  when cobo was appointed acting provincial
san pedro martyr was again assigned to the chinese ministry  he had
learned tagalog  and after his return to the pari n  he learned more
words of the chinese language than any other member of the order 
though he was not successful with the pronunciation        

on may           the governor received a letter from the emperor of
japan demanding that an ambassador be sent to offer him the fealty
of the philippines  juan cobo  as the best speaker of chinese  was
chosen to represent the spaniards  and he left manila on july    
      after successfully convincing the japanese emperor of the amity
of the spaniards  he left to come back to manila  but his ship was
wrecked in november on the coast of formosa  and there cobo was killed
by hostile natives  meanwhile benavides had gone back to spain with
bishop salazar in       and did not return to the philippines until
after his appointment as bishop of nueva segovia in      

that left as the only two remaining experts in the chinese language 
domingo de nieva and juan de san pedro martyr  both of whom were at
san gabriel in        moreover  both of them knew chinese and tagalog  
a text in tagalog was available  based on the talavera plasencia oliver
model  which had circulated freely  and this  we believe  was further
edited  hence the  corrected by the religious of the orders   by these
two dominicans  in their editorial work they may have been helped
by juan de la cruz  who  we have noted  was sent to bataan in      
there learned tagalog  and  succeeded so perfectly with it that father
fr  francisco san joseph  who was afterwards the best linguist there 
profited by the papers and labors of p  fr  juan de la cruz        
juan de oliver  the pioneer franciscan tagalist was still living and
available for consultation  and the polylingual jesuit  francisco
almerique  also was in manila at the time  a chinese text had been
written by juan cobo  and both nieva and san pedro martyr were capable
of preparing this for publication  again possibly aided by almerique 
and also diego mu oz  if as an augustinian he had been willing to
cooperate with the dominicans  nothing remained to be done but have
the blocks cut and the impressions pulled 



the printing of the books


the stage was set for the production of the doctrinas  that there
were chinese xylographic models upon which the books could be based
is evidenced by the account of mendoza of the considerable number of
chinese books brought to manila by martin de rada as early as       a
more likely model was a bilingual text in spanish and chinese which
cobo describes in his letter of july           where speaking of the
jesuits in china he says 


     moreover the father of the company who was in china wrote and
    printed in chinese letters a whole book of the unity of god 
    the creation of the world  and the commandments explained 
    and in this book has gotten as far as the incarnation of
    the son of god  concerning this i am not speaking of things
    heard  for i have it  and am thus certain of it  as of all
    the things that happened  how far i have progressed with the
    chinese letters i shall say later  this book was printed in
    china in       it circulates freely in china whence we have
    our copy  and because of the writing  contrary to what others
    have misleadingly said about the chinese  they have done him
    no ill  from which it may be inferred that the lion is not
    so wild as they paint him        


there is no direct evidence to support our belief that it was during
the brief period after castro returned  probably late in       and
relieved cobo of his executive responsibilities  and june      when he
left for japan  that cobo began intensive plans for the production of
bilingual texts  his recorded interest in such books  his influence
with the chinese  his energy and his own linguistic aptitude would
naturally have stimulated him to undertake the task  whether he
actually began work on the blocks from which the books were printed 
or merely suggested the feasibility of the idea  we do not know 
but we feel sure that juan cobo was the father of the production of
books in the philippines 

there is no need here to go into the history of printing in china 
the method used there and its antiquity have been fully described
by others        that there were chinese in manila who understood
this age old process would seem obvious from the reports of skilled
craftsmen whose presence was noted by all the writers of the period  we
have already quoted a reference to juan cobo s teaching them european
trades  and salazar in his already cited letter speaks of them further 


     they are so skillful and clever  that  as soon as they see
    any object made by a spanish workman  they reproduce it with
    exactness  what arouses my wonder most is  that when i arrived
    no sangley knew how to paint anything  but now they have
    so perfected themselves in this art that they have produced
    marvelous works with both the brush and the chisel     what has
    pleased all of us here has been the arrival of a bookbinder
    from mexico  he brought books with him  set up a bindery 
    and hired a sangley who had offered his services to him  the
    sangley secretly  and without his master noticing it  watched
    how the latter bound books  and lo  in less than  lacuna in
    ms   he left the house  saying that he wished to serve him
    no longer  and set up a similar shop        


to turn over a manuscript copy of a book to a chinaman who had already
some familiarity with the production of books in china  or who with a
given text could carve the blocks according to tradition  was then not
a matter of great difficulty  there were chinese books which showed
what the result would be  there were spanish books  definitely some
from mexico  which provided samples of european characters and format 

who cut the blocks  that is exactly what chinaman  we do not know 
nor do we know who handled the presswork  but it is logical to assume
that the whole process took place under the supervision of the fathers
of san gabriel  juan cobo if work had begun before       and certainly
nieva and san pedro martyr  one further aide may have been the lay
brother  pedro rodriguez  who had been sent to san gabriel with nieva 
and who was a handyman or skilled mechanic  for aduarte credits him
with rebuilding and restoring the hospital 

in speaking of the book printed for blancas de san jos   aduarte said
that the printing had been done by  a chinaman  a good christian  
      but in this particular account he does not give the chinaman s
name  yet  where he describes the founding of a second church of san
gabriel in binondo  sometime after march                and before
june          when it was admitted to the chapter  he tells in some
detail of printing done by juan de vera       


     there have been in this town  binondo  then called minondoc 
    many chinese of very exemplary lives  juan de vera was
    not only a very devout man  and one much given to prayer 
    but a man who caused all his household to be the same  he
    always heard mass  and was very regular in his attendance at
    church  he adorned the church most handsomely with hangings
    and paintings  because he understood this art  he also 
    thinking only of the great results to be attained by means
    of holy and devout books  gave himself to the great labor
    necessary to establish printing in this country  where there
    was no journeyman who could show him the way  or give him an
    account of the manner of printing in europe  which is very
    different from the manner of printing followed in his own
    country of china  the lord aided his pious intentions  and
    he gave to this undertaking not only continued and excessive
    labor  but all the forces of his mind  which were great  in
    spite of the difficulties  he attained that which he desired 
    and was the first printer in these islands  and this not from
    avarice  for he gained much more in his business as a merchant 
    and readily gave up his profit  but merely to do service to
    the lord and this good to the souls of the natives        


it is interesting to note that this narrative  which is in substance
similar to that about the books of blancas de san jos   nowhere
mentions the name of the priest in connection with vera  it is probable
that juan de vera was  as retana believed  the first typographer  and
it may be that he also printed the doctrinas of       it is impossible
to say with certainty  but it is not too fanciful to suppose that
juan de vera tried xylographic printing under the supervision of
nieva and san pedro martyr  and after some experimenting achieved
typography in the time of blancas de san jos  

since we have here dealt with a volume printed entirely from
wood blocks it does not seem necessary to discuss in detail the
subsequent typographical books  however  just as this goes to press 
a copy of the  ordinationes generales prouintiae sanctissimi rosarij
philippinarum         printed at binondo by juan de vera in      
has been discovered  and also presented by mr  rosenwald to the
library of congress  this is the volume described by remesal      
as being printed  in as fine characters and as correctly as if in
rome or lyon   no copy of the book had been described since his day 
although medina       and retana       both listed it from references
which probably derived from remesal  its discovery  almost unbelievable
coming so close on the heels of that of the doctrina  helps to close
the gap between the latter and the two bataan imprints       of      
the  arte y reglas de la lengva tagala  and the  librong pagaaralan
nang manga tagalog nang uicang castilla  

the full story of the early typographical products of the philippines
must wait upon another occasion  for the questions posed by the scanty
records and the handful of surviving books are extremely knotty  where
did the type come from  medina suggested it was imported from macao 
retana believed it to have been cut in the philippines  fern ndez
said that the first works of blancas de san jos  were printed at
bataan and the two      books have that place of printing  yet in
     the  ordinationes  issued from binondo  remesal wrote that this
book was printed by francisco de vera  and the book itself bears the
name of juan  indeed  the history of the early typographers and the
output of their presses  as it has so far been written  presents many
problems  but they are problems which we feel are outside the scope
of this study 

to summarize what we have learned of the earliest printing in the
philippines  we have the possibility  but not a likely one  that
an  arte  by juan de qui ones was printed xylographically in      
we know that in the first half of the year      two doctrinas were
printed xylographically  although we have no way of telling which
came first  one in tagalog from the talavera plasencia oliver text 
and one in chinese written by juan cobo  both edited and printed under
the supervision of domingo de nieva and juan de san pedro martyr 
we surmise that between      and      other works were also printed
xylographically  such as the small tracts of juan de villanueva and
some of the books of blancas de san jos   nieva and others  and in
     was printed by juan de vera  in all likelihood from movable
type  the book of our lady of the rosary by blancas de san jos   the
known facts are not many  and we can only hope that time and further
research will discover new ones to make the history of the earliest
philippine imprints more complete and more satisfactory

notes

    tagalog characters are said to be similar to old javanese  ignacio
villamot   la antigua escritura filipina   manila        p      they
were replaced under the spanish occupation by roman letters  and
are not now used  the best definitive grammar is frank r  blake s  a
grammar of the tagalog language   new haven        where  p     he
defines the language as follows   tag log is the principal language
of luzon  the largest island of the philippine archipelago  it is
spoken in manila and in the middle region of luzon  tag log  like
all the philippine languages about which anything is known  belongs
to the malayo polynesian family of speech  which embraces the idioms
spoken on the islands of polynesia  melanesia  and malaysia  on the
malay peninsula  and on the island of madagascar  

    the woodcut  showing st  dominic beneath a star holding a lily and
a book  the usual symbols of this saint  and clad in the white habit
and black cloak of his order  seems to be of oriental workmanship 
differing vastly from contemporary spanish and mexican cuts of the
same type  the clouds  for instance  are characteristically chinese 
and the buildings in the background more reminiscent of eastern
temples than european churches

account of the ms  see santiago vela  vi  p     n  schilling  p      
demonstrates that according to the original punctuation the meaning
is that the first printers were villanueva and blancas de san jos  
but with the shifting of a semi colon it could be read to mean that the
first printers were of the order of st  augustine  we can see no reason
to shift the semi colon  and have retained it in its original place 

     retana  col      said that he was able to find no information
regarding villanueva except for the listing of his name by cano 
p      as having arrived in the philippines at an unknown date  the
destruction of the early records of the augustinians when the english
sacked manila in      accounts for the paucity of information  but
there are a few references which throw some little light on the two
villanuevas  san agustin  p       says that when herrara sailed for
mexico in      he left in ceb  only  p  fr  martin de rada and two
virtuous clerics  the one named juan de vivero  and the other juan

come back to ceb  in       francisco moreno   historia de la santa
iglesia metropolitana de filipinas hasta        manila        p      
states that villanueva came in       and died shortly after       san
antonio  i  p       writes   another cleric was the licentiate don
juan de villanueva  of whom the only thing known is that he was a
churchman and lived but a short time  and that after the erection of
the church   this refers to the foundation of the church in manila in
      of the other villanueva our information comes from perez  p

in direct contradiction to those we shall cite later in connection
with the controversy between the augustinians and dominicans over
the chinese ministry  the convent at tondo had been founded in

priests fluent in the idiom  the language had not yet been reduced to
a grammar  so that it could be learned by common grammatical rules 
nor was there a general vocabulary of speech  except that each one

the establishment of a province in the orient  and sent juan
chris stomo to europe to obtain the necessary permission from lay
and ecclesiastical authorities  the jesuit alonso sanchez  who had
been sent to spain to explain the situation in the philippines 
was at court  and told the king and council of the indies  quite
subverting his mission  that there was no need for more priests
and particularly no need for a new order there  chris stomo was
discouraged  but the scheme was revivified by juan de castro who
finally secured a letter from philip ii on september          endorsing
the plan  twenty two volunteers sailed from spain on july           in
mexico the dominicans again found sanchez propagandizing against the
mission and also encountered the efforts of the viceroy to persuade
the friars to remain there  notwithstanding  twenty friars subscribed
to a set of ordinances at the convent of santo domingo in mexico on
december           of the twenty  fifteen went to the philippines 
three went directly to china  and juan chris stomo  who was ill and
weak  and juan cobo  who had business there  stayed behind in mexico

that he preached publicly against them  as a result of which he
was banished by the viceroy  he brought with him from mexico a
fellow reformer and exile  luis gandullo  and four other recruits
for the philippine mission

      sangley  a term used by the natives to designate chinese 
was derived from the cantonese  hiang   or  xiang   and  ley 
meaning a  travelling merchant   it was adopted by the spaniards
and in most instances used interchangeably with chinese  if any
distinction existed it was that a sangley was a permanent resident
of the philippines  quite contrary to the derivation of the word  or
a chinese of partially native blood  see san agustin  p

necessary to spread the chinese christian settlement to a new site
directly across the river  where land was given them by don luis
p rez dasmari as  the son and successor of g mez p rez dasmari as 
and there a second church of san gabriel was built  according to an
inscription on a painting of don luis  exhibited at the st  louis
fair of      and illustrated in b    r   xxx  p       he bought the
land from don antonio velada on march           so that san gabriel

moved several years after its foundation to binondo at the request
of the city  and was rebuilt twice  it is apparent that san gabriel
in the parian was abandoned after the church in binondo was built 

      juan de vera was probably a comparatively common name at this
time  because upon baptism the natives and chinese assumed any spanish
name they pleased  and since santiago de vera was governor from      to
