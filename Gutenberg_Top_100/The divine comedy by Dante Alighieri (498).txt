life i found me in a gloomy wood astray gone from the path direct and een to tell it were no easy task how savage wild that forest how robust and rough its growth which to remember only my dismay renews in bitterness not far from death yet to discourse of what there good befell all else will i relate discoverd there how first i enterd it i scarce can say such sleepy dullness in that instant weighd my senses down when the true path i left but when a mountains foot i reachd where closd the valley that had piercd my heart with dread i lookd aloft and saw his shoulders broad already vested with that planets beam who leads all wanderers safe through every way then was a little respite to the fear that in my hearts recesses deep had lain all of that night so pitifully passd and as a man with difficult short breath forespent with toiling scapd from sea to shore turns to the perilous wide waste and stands at gaze een so my spirit that yet faild struggling with terror turnd to view the straits that none hath passd and livd my weary frame after short pause recomforted again i journeyd on over that lonely steep the hinder foot still firmer scarce the ascent began when lo a panther nimble light and coverd with a speckled skin appeard nor when it saw me vanishd rather strove to check my onward going that ofttimes with purpose to retrace my steps i turnd the hour was mornings prime and on his way aloft the sun ascended with those stars that with him rose when love divine first movd those its fair works so that with joyous hope all things conspird to fill me the gay skin of that swift animal the matin dawn and the sweet season soon that joy was chasd and by new dread succeeded when in view a lion came gainst me as it appeard with his head held aloft and hungermad that een the air was fearstruck a shewolf was at his heels who in her leanness seemd full of all wants and many a land hath made disconsolate ere now she with such fear oerwhelmed me at the sight of her appalld that of the height all hope i lost as one who with his gain elated sees the time when all unwares is gone he inwardly mourns with heartgriping anguish such was i haunted by that fell beast never at peace who coming oer against me by degrees impelld me where the sun in silence rests while to the lower space with backward step i fell my ken discernd the form one of one whose voice seemd faint through long disuse of speech when him in that great desert i espied have mercy on me cried i out aloud spirit or living man what eer thou be he answerd now not man man once i was and born of lombard parents mantuana both by country when the power of julius yet was scarcely firm at rome my life was past beneath the mild augustus in the time of fabled deities and false a bard was i and made anchises upright son the subject of my song who came from troy when the flames preyd on iliums haughty towers but thou say wherefore to such perils past returnst thou wherefore not this pleasant mount ascendest cause and source of all delight and art thou then that virgil that wellspring from which such copious floods of eloquence have issued i with front abashd replied glory and light of all the tuneful train may it avail me that i long with zeal have sought thy volume and with love immense have connd it oer my master thou and guide thou he from whom alone i have derivd that style which for its beauty into fame exalts me see the beast from whom i fled o save me from her thou illustrious sage for every vein and pulse throughout my frame she hath made tremble he soon as he saw that i was weeping answerd thou must needs another way pursue if thou wouldst scape from out that savage wilderness this beast at whom thou criest her way will suffer none to pass and no less hindrance makes than death so bad and so accursed in her kind that never sated is her ravenous will still after food more craving than before to many an animal in wedlock vile she fastens and shall yet to many more until that greyhound come who shall destroy her with sharp pain he will not life support by earth nor its base metals but by love wisdom and virtue and his land shall be the land twixt either feltro in his might shall safety to italias plains arise for whose fair realm camilla virgin pure nisus euryalus and turnus fell he with incessant chase through every town shall worry until he to hell at length restore her thence by envy first let loose i for thy profit pondring now devise that thou mayst follow me and i thy guide will lead thee hence through an eternal space where thou shalt hear despairing shrieks and see spirits of old tormented who invoke a second death and those next view who dwell content in fire for that they hope to come wheneer the time may be among the blest into whose regions if thou then desire t ascend a spirit worthier than i must lead thee in whose charge when i depart thou shalt be left for that almighty king who reigns above a rebel to his law adjudges me and therefore hath decreed that to his city none through me should come he in all parts hath sway there rules there holds his citadel and throne o happy those whom there he chooses i to him in few bard by that god whom thou didst not adore i do beseech thee that this ill and worse i may escape to lead me where thou saidst that i saint peters gate may view and those who as thou tellst are in such dismal plight onward he movd i close his steps pursud canto ii now was the day departing and the air imbrownd with shadows from their toils releasd all animals on earth and i alone prepard myself the conflict to sustain both of sad pity and that perilous road which my unerring memory shall retrace o muses o high genius now vouchsafe your aid o mind that all i saw hast kept safe in a written record here thy worth and eminent endowments come to proof i thus began bard thou who art my guide consider well if virtue be in me sufficient ere to this high enterprise thou trust me thou hast told that silvius sire yet clothd in corruptible flesh among th immortal tribes had entrance and was there sensible present yet if heavens great lord almighty foe to ill such favour shewd in contemplation of the high effect both what and who from him should issue forth it seems in reasons judgment well deservd sith he of rome and of romes empire wide in heavens empyreal height was chosen sire both which if truth be spoken were ordaind and stablishd for the holy place where sits who to great peters sacred chair succeeds he from this journey in thy song renownd learnd things that to his victory gave rise and to the papal robe in aftertimes the chosen vessel also traveld there to bring us back assurance in that faith which is the entrance to salvations way but i why should i there presume or who permits it not aeneas i nor paul myself i deem not worthy and none else will deem me i if on this voyage then i venture fear it will in folly end thou who art wise better my meaning knowst than i can speak as one who unresolves what he hath late resolvd and with new thoughts changes his purpose from his first intent removd een such was i on that dun coast wasting in thought my enterprise at first so eagerly embracd if right thy words i scan replied that shade magnanimous thy soul is by vile fear assaild which oft so overcasts a man that he recoils from noblest resolution like a beast at some false semblance in the twilight gloom that from this terror thou mayst free thyself i will instruct thee why i came and what i heard in that same instant when for thee grief touchd me first i was among the tribe who rest suspended when a dame so blest and lovely i besought her to command calld me her eyes were brighter than the star of day and she with gentle voice and soft angelically tund her speech addressd o courteous shade of mantua thou whose fame yet lives and shall live long as nature lasts a friend not of my fortune but myself on the wide desert in his road has met hindrance so great that he through fear has turnd now much i dread lest he past help have strayd and i be risn too late for his relief from what in heaven of him i heard speed now and by thy eloquent persuasive tongue and by all means for his deliverance meet assist him so to me will comfort spring i who now bid thee on this errand forth am beatrice from a place i come note beatrice i use this word as it is pronounced in the italian as consisting of four syllables of which the third is a long one revisited with joy love brought me thence who prompts my speech when in my masters sight i stand thy praise to him i oft will tell she then was silent and i thus began o lady by whose influence alone mankind excels whatever is containd within that heaven which hath the smallest orb so thy command delights me that to obey if it were done already would seem late no need hast thou farther to speak thy will yet tell the reason why thou art not loth to leave that ample space where to return thou burnest for this centre here beneath she then since thou so deeply wouldst inquire i will instruct thee briefly why no dread hinders my entrance here those things alone are to be feard whence evil may proceed none else for none are terrible beside i am so framd by god thanks to his grace that any suffrance of your misery touches me not nor flame of that fierce fire assails me in high heaven a blessed dame besides who mourns with such effectual grief that hindrance which i send thee to remove that gods stern judgment to her will inclines to lucia calling her she thus bespake now doth thy faithful servant need thy aid and i commend him to thee at her word sped lucia of all cruelty the foe and coming to the place where i abode seated with rachel her of ancient days she thus addressd me thou true praise of god beatrice why is not thy succour lent to him who so much lovd thee as to leave for thy sake all the multitude admires dost thou not hear how pitiful his wail nor mark the death which in the torrent flood swoln mightier than a sea him struggling holds neer among men did any with such speed haste to their profit flee from their annoy as when these words were spoken i came here down from my blessed seat trusting the force of thy pure eloquence which thee and all who well have markd it into honour brings when she had ended her bright beaming eyes tearful she turnd aside whereat i felt redoubled zeal to serve thee as she willd thus am i come i savd thee from the beast who thy near way across the goodly mount prevented what is this comes oer thee then why why dost thou hang back why in thy breast harbour vile fear why hast not courage there and noble daring since three maids so blest thy safety plan een in the court of heaven and so much certain good my words forebode as florets by the frosty air of night bent down and closd when day has blanchd their leaves rise all unfolded on their spiry stems so was my fainting vigour new restord and to my heart such kindly courage ran that i as one undaunted soon replied o full of pity she who undertook my succour and thou kind who didst perform so soon her true behest with such desire thou hast disposd me to renew my voyage that my first purpose fully is resumd lead on one only will is in us both thou art my guide my master thou and lord so spake i and when he had onward movd i enterd on the deep and woody way canto iii through me you pass into the city of woe through me you pass into eternal pain through me among the people lost for aye justice the founder of my fabric movd to rear me was the task of power divine supremest wisdom and primeval love before me things create were none save things eternal and eternal i endure all hope abandon ye who enter here such characters in colour dim i markd over a portals lofty arch inscribd whereat i thus master these words import hard meaning he as one prepard replied here thou must all distrust behind thee leave here be vile fear extinguishd we are come where i have told thee we shall see the souls to misery doomd who intellectual good have lost and when his hand he had stretchd forth to mine with pleasant looks whence i was cheerd into that secret place he led me on here sighs with lamentations and loud moans resounded through the air piercd by no star that een i wept at entering various tongues horrible languages outcries of woe accents of anger voices deep and hoarse with hands together smote that swelld the sounds made up a tumult that for ever whirls round through that air with solid darkness staind like to the sand that in the whirlwind flies i then with error yet encompassd cried o master what is this i hear what race are these who seem so overcome with woe he thus to me this miserable fate suffer the wretched souls of those who livd without or praise or blame with that ill band of angels mixd who nor rebellious provd nor yet were true to god but for themselves were only from his bounds heaven drove them forth not to impair his lustre nor the depth of hell receives them lest th accursed tribe should glory thence with exultation vain i then master what doth aggrieve them thus that they lament so loud he straight replied that will i tell thee briefly these of death no hope may entertain and their blind life so meanly passes that all other lots they envy fame of them the world hath none nor suffers mercy and justice scorn them both speak not of them but look and pass them by and i who straightway lookd beheld a flag which whirling ran around so rapidly that it no pause obtaind and following came such a long train of spirits i should neer have thought that death so many had despoild when some of these i recognizd i saw and knew the shade of him who to base fear yielding abjurd his high estate forthwith i understood for certain this the tribe of those ill spirits both to god displeasing and to his foes these wretches who neer lived went on in nakedness and sorely stung by wasps and hornets which bedewd their cheeks with blood that mixd with tears droppd to their feet and by disgustful worms was gatherd there then looking farther onwards i beheld a throng upon the shore of a great stream whereat i thus sir grant me now to know whom here we view and whence impelld they seem so eager to pass oer as i discern through the blear light he thus to me in few this shalt thou know soon as our steps arrive beside the woeful tide of acheron then with eyes downward cast and filld with shame fearing my words offensive to his ear till we had reachd the river i from speech abstaind and lo toward us in a bark comes on an old man hoary white with eld crying woe to you wicked spirits hope not ever to see the sky again i come to take you to the other shore across into eternal darkness there to dwell in fierce heat and in ice and thou who there standest live spirit get thee hence and leave these who are dead but soon as he beheld i left them not by other way said he by other haven shalt thou come to shore not by this passage thee a nimbler boat must carry then to him thus spake my guide charon thyself torment not so t is willd where will and power are one ask thou no more straightway in silence fell the shaggy cheeks of him the boatman oer the livid lake around whose eyes glard wheeling flames meanwhile those spirits faint and naked color changd and gnashd their teeth soon as the cruel words they heard god and their parents they blasphemd the human kind the place the time and seed that did engender them and give them birth then all together sorely wailing drew to the cursd strand that every man must pass who fears not god charon demoniac form with eyes of burning coal collects them all beckning and each that lingers with his oar strikes as fall off the light autumnal leaves one still another following till the bough strews all its honours on the earth beneath een in like manner adams evil brood cast themselves one by one down from the shore each at a beck as falcon at his call thus go they over through the umberd wave and ever they on the opposing bank be landed on this side another throng still gathers son thus spake the courteous guide those who die subject to the wrath of god all here together come from every clime and to oerpass the river are not loth for so heavens justice goads them on that fear is turnd into desire hence neer hath past good spirit if of thee charon complain now mayst thou know the import of his words this said the gloomy region trembling shook so terribly that yet with clammy dews fear chills my brow the sad earth gave a blast that lightening shot forth a vermilion flame which all my senses conquerd quite and i down droppd as one with sudden slumber seizd canto iv broke the deep slumber in my brain a crash of heavy thunder that i shook myself as one by main force rousd risen upright my rested eyes i movd around and searchd with fixed ken to know what place it was wherein i stood for certain on the brink i found me of the lamentable vale the dread abyss that joins a thundrous sound of plaints innumerable dark and deep and thick with clouds oerspread mine eye in vain explord its bottom nor could aught discern now let us to the blind world there beneath descend the bard began all pale of look i go the first and thou shalt follow next then i his alterd hue perceiving thus how may i speed if thou yieldest to dread who still art wont to comfort me in doubt he then the anguish of that race below with pity stains my cheek which thou for fear mistakest let us on our length of way urges to haste onward this said he movd and entring led me with him on the bounds of the first circle that surrounds th abyss here as mine ear could note no plaint was heard except of sighs that made th eternal air tremble not causd by tortures but from grief felt by those multitudes many and vast of men women and infants then to me the gentle guide inquirst thou not what spirits are these which thou beholdest ere thou pass farther i would thou know that these of sin were blameless and if aught they merited it profits not since baptism was not theirs the portal to thy faith if they before the gospel livd they servd not god aright and among such am i for these defects and for no other evil we are lost only so far afflicted that we live desiring without hope so grief assaild my heart at hearing this for well i knew suspended in that limbo many a soul of mighty worth o tell me sire reverd tell me my master i began through wish of full assurance in that holy faith which vanquishes all error say did eer any or through his own or others merit come forth from thence whom afterward was blest piercing the secret purport of my speech he answerd i was new to that estate when i beheld a puissant one arrive amongst us with victorious trophy crownd he forth the shade of our first parent drew abel his child and noah righteous man of moses lawgiver for faith approvd of patriarch abraham and david king israel with his sire and with his sons nor without rachel whom so hard he won and others many more whom he to bliss exalted before these be thou assurd no spirit of human kind was ever savd we while he spake ceasd not our onward road still passing through the wood for so i name those spirits thick beset we were not far on this side from the summit when i kennd a flame that oer the darkend hemisphere prevailing shind yet we a little space were distant not so far but i in part discoverd that a tribe in honour high that place possessd o thou who every art and science valust who are these that boast such honour separate from all the rest he answerd the renown of their great names that echoes through your world above acquires favour in heaven which holds them thus advancd meantime a voice i heard honour the bard sublime his shade returns that left us late no sooner ceasd the sound than i beheld four mighty spirits toward us bend their steps of semblance neither sorrowful nor glad when thus my master kind began mark him who in his right hand bears that falchion keen the other three preceding as their lord this is that homer of all bards supreme flaccus the next in satires vein excelling the third is naso lucan is the last because they all that appellation own with which the voice singly accosted me honouring they greet me thus and well they judge so i beheld united the bright school of him the monarch of sublimest song that oer the others like an eagle soars when they together short discourse had held they turnd to me with salutation kind beckning me at the which my master smild nor was this all but greater honour still they gave me for they made me of their tribe and i was sixth amid so learnd a band far as the luminous beacon on we passd speaking of matters then befitting well to speak now fitter left untold at foot of a magnificent castle we arrivd seven times with lofty walls begirt and round defended by a pleasant stream oer this as oer dry land we passd next through seven gates i with those sages enterd and we came into a mead with lively verdure fresh there dwelt a race who slow their eyes around majestically movd and in their port bore eminent authority they spake seldom but all their words were tuneful sweet we to one side retird into a place open and bright and lofty whence each one stood manifest to view incontinent there on the green enamel of the plain were shown me the great spirits by whose sight i am exalted in my own esteem electra there i saw accompanied by many among whom hector i knew anchises pious son and with hawks eye caesar all armd and by camilla there penthesilea on the other side old king latinus seated by his child lavinia and that brutus i beheld who tarquin chasd lucretia catos wife marcia with julia and cornelia there and sole apart retird the soldan fierce then when a little more i raisd my brow i spied the master of the sapient throng seated amid the philosophic train him all admire all pay him revrence due there socrates and plato both i markd nearest to him in rank democritus who sets the world at chance diogenes with heraclitus and empedocles and anaxagoras and thales sage zeno and dioscorides well read in natures secret lore orpheus i markd and linus tully and moral seneca euclid and ptolemy hippocrates galenus avicen and him who made that commentary vast averroes of all to speak at full were vain attempt for my wide theme so urges that ofttimes my words fall short of what bechancd in two the six associates part another way my sage guide leads me from that air serene into a climate ever vexd with storms and to a part i come where no light shines canto v from the first circle i descended thus down to the second which a lesser space embracing so much more of grief contains provoking bitter moans there minos stands grinning with ghastly feature he of all who enter strict examining the crimes gives sentence and dismisses them beneath according as he foldeth him around for when before him comes th ill fated soul it all confesses and that judge severe of sins considering what place in hell suits the transgression with his tail so oft himself encircles as degrees beneath he dooms it to descend before him stand always a numrous throng and in his turn each one to judgment passing speaks and hears his fate thence downward to his dwelling hurld o thou who to this residence of woe approachest when he saw me coming cried minos relinquishing his dread employ look how thou enter here beware in whom thou place thy trust let not the entrance broad deceive thee to thy harm to him my guide wherefore exclaimest hinder not his way by destiny appointed so tis willd where will and power are one ask thou no more now gin the rueful wailings to be heard now am i come where many a plaining voice smites on mine ear into a place i came where light was silent all bellowing there groand a noise as of a sea in tempest torn by warring winds the stormy blast of hell with restless fury drives the spirits on whirld round and dashd amain with sore annoy when they arrive before the ruinous sweep there shrieks are heard there lamentations moans and blasphemies gainst the good power in heaven i understood that to this torment sad the carnal sinners are condemnd in whom reason by lust is swayd as in large troops and multitudinous when winter reigns the starlings on their wings are borne abroad so bears the tyrannous gust those evil souls on this side and on that above below it drives them hope of rest to solace them is none nor een of milder pang as cranes chanting their dolrous notes traverse the sky stretchd out in long array so i beheld spirits who came loud wailing hurried on by their dire doom then i instructor who are these by the black air so scourgdthe first mong those of whom thou questionst he replied oer many tongues was empress she in vice of luxury was so shameless that she made liking be lawful by promulgd decree to clear the blame she had herself incurrd this is semiramis of whom tis writ that she succeeded ninus her espousd and held the land which now the soldan rules the next in amorous fury slew herself and to sicheus ashes broke her faith then follows cleopatra lustful queen there markd i helen for whose sake so long the time was fraught with evil there the great achilles who with love fought to the end paris i saw and tristan and beside a thousand more he showd me and by name pointed them out whom love bereavd of life when i had heard my sage instructor name those dames and knights of antique days oerpowerd by pity wellnigh in amaze my mind was lost and i began bard willingly i would address those two together coming which seem so light before the wind he thus note thou when nearer they to us approach then by that love which carries them along entreat and they will come soon as the wind swayd them toward us i thus framd my speech o wearied spirits come and hold discourse with us if by none else restraind as doves by fond desire invited on wide wings and firm to their sweet nest returning home cleave the air wafted by their will along thus issud from that troop where dido ranks they through the ill air speeding with such force my cry prevaild by strong affection urgd o gracious creature and benign who gost visiting through this element obscure us who the world with bloody stain imbrud if for a friend the king of all we ownd our prayr to him should for thy peace arise since thou hast pity on our evil plight of whatsoeer to hear or to discourse it pleases thee that will we hear of that freely with thee discourse while eer the wind as now is mute the land that gave me birth is situate on the coast where po descends to rest in ocean with his sequent streams love that in gentle heart is quickly learnt entangled him by that fair form from me taen in such cruel sort as grieves me still love that denial takes from none belovd caught me with pleasing him so passing well that as thou seest he yet deserts me not love brought us to one death caina waits the soul who spilt our life such were their words at hearing which downward i bent my looks and held them there so long that the bard cried what art thou pondring i in answer thus alas by what sweet thoughts what fond desire must they at length to that ill pass have reachd then turning i to them my speech addressd and thus began francesca your sad fate even to tears my grief and pity moves but tell me in the time of your sweet sighs by what and how love granted that ye knew your yet uncertain wishes she replied no greater grief than to remember days of joy when misry is at hand that kens thy learnd instructor yet so eagerly if thou art bent to know the primal root from whence our love gat being i will do as one who weeps and tells his tale one day for our delight we read of lancelot how him love thralld alone we were and no suspicion near us ofttimes by that reading our eyes were drawn together and the hue fled from our alterd cheek but at one point alone we fell when of that smile we read the wished smile rapturously kissd by one so deep in love then he who neer from me shall separate at once my lips all trembling kissd the book and writer both were loves purveyors in its leaves that day we read no more while thus one spirit spake the other waild so sorely that heartstruck i through compassion fainting seemd not far from death and like a corpse fell to the ground canto vi my sense reviving that erewhile had droopd with pity for the kindred shades whence grief oercame me wholly straight around i see new torments new tormented souls which way soeer i move or turn or bend my sight in the third circle i arrive of showrs ceaseless accursed heavy and cold unchangd for ever both in kind and in degree large hail discolourd water sleety flaw through the dun midnight air streamd down amain stank all the land whereon that tempest fell cerberus cruel monster fierce and strange through his wide threefold throat barks as a dog over the multitude immersd beneath his eyes glare crimson black his unctuous beard his belly large and clawd the hands with which he tears the spirits flays them and their limbs piecemeal disparts howling there spread as curs under the rainy deluge with one side the other screening oft they roll them round a wretched godless crew when that great worm descried us savage cerberus he opd his jaws and the fangs showd us not a limb of him but trembled then my guide his palms expanding on the ground thence filled with earth raisd them and cast it in his ravenous maw een as a dog that yelling bays for food his keeper when the morsel comes lets fall his fury bent alone with eager haste to swallow it so droppd the loathsome cheeks of demon cerberus who thundring stuns the spirits that they for deafness wish in vain we oer the shades thrown prostrate by the brunt of the heavy tempest passing set our feet upon their emptiness that substance seemd they all along the earth extended lay save one that sudden raisd himself to sit soon as that way he saw us pass o thou he cried who through the infernal shades art led own if again thou knowst me thou wast framd or ere my frame was broken i replied the anguish thou endurst perchance so takes thy form from my remembrance that it seems as if i saw thee never but inform me who thou art that in a place so sad art set and in such torment that although other be greater more disgustful none can be imagind he in answer thus thy city heapd with envy to the brim ay that the measure overflows its bounds held me in brighter days ye citizens were wont to name me ciacco for the sin of gluttny damned vice beneath this rain een as thou seest i with fatigue am worn nor i sole spirit in this woe all these have by like crime incurrd like punishment no more he said and i my speech resumd ciacco thy dire affliction grieves me much even to tears but tell me if thou knowst what shall at length befall the citizens of the divided city whether any just one inhabit there and tell me of the cause whence jarring discord hath assaild it thus he then after long striving they will come to blood and the wild party from the woods will chase the other with much injury forth then it behoves that this must fall within three solar circles and the other rise by borrowd force of one who under shore now rests it shall a long space hold aloof its forehead keeping under heavy weight the other oppressd indignant at the load and grieving sore the just are two in number but they neglected avrice envy pride three fatal sparks have set the hearts of all on fire here ceasd the lamentable sound and i continud thus still would i learn more from thee farther parley still entreat of farinata and tegghiaio say they who so well deservd of giacopo arrigo mosca and the rest who bent their minds on working good oh tell me where they bide and to their knowledge let me come for i am pressd with keen desire to hear if heavens sweet cup or poisonous drug of hell be to their lip assignd he answerd straight these are yet blacker spirits various crimes have sunk them deeper in the dark abyss if thou so far descendest thou mayst see them but to the pleasant world when thou returnst of me make mention i entreat thee there no more i tell thee answer thee no more this said his fixed eyes he turnd askance a little eyd me then bent down his head and midst his blind companions with it fell when thus my guide no more his bed he leaves ere the last angeltrumpet blow the power adverse to these shall then in glory come each one forthwith to his sad tomb repair resume his fleshly vesture and his form and hear the eternal doom reechoing rend the vault so passd we through that mixture foul of spirits and rain with tardy steps meanwhile touching though slightly on the life to come for thus i questiond shall these tortures sir when the great sentence passes be increasd or mitigated or as now severe he then consult thy knowledge that decides that as each thing to more perfection grows it feels more sensibly both good and pain though neer to true perfection may arrive this race accursd yet nearer then than now they shall approach it compassing that path circuitous we journeyed and discourse much more than i relate between us passd till at the point where the steps led below arrivd there plutus the great foe we found canto vii ah me o satan satan loud exclaimd plutus in accent hoarse of wild alarm and the kind sage whom no event surprisd to comfort me thus spake let not thy fear harm thee for power in him be sure is none to hinder down this rock thy safe descent then to that sworn lip turning peace he cried cursd wolf thy fury inward on thyself prey and consume thee through the dark profound not without cause he passes so t is willd on high there where the great archangel pourd heavns vengeance on the first adulterer proud as sails full spread and bellying with the wind drop suddenly collapsd if the mast split so to the ground down droppd the cruel fiend thus we descending to the fourth steep ledge gaind on the dismal shore that all the woe hems in of all the universe ah me almighty justice in what store thou heapst new pains new troubles as i here beheld wherefore doth fault of ours bring us to this een as a billow on charybdis rising against encounterd billow dashing breaks such is the dance this wretched race must lead whom more than elsewhere numerous here i found from one side and the other with loud voice both rolld on weights by main forge of their breasts then smote together and each one forthwith rolld them back voluble turning again exclaiming these why holdest thou so fast those answering and why castest thou away so still repeating their despiteful song they to the opposite point on either hand traversd the horrid circle then arrivd both turnd them round and through the middle space conflicting met again at sight whereof i stung with grief thus spake o say my guide what race is this were these whose heads are shorn on our left hand all seprate to the church he straight replied in their first life these all in mind were so distorted that they made according to due measure of their wealth no use this clearly from their words collect which they howl forth at each extremity arriving of the circle where their crime contrary in kind disparts them to the church were separate those that with no hairy cowls are crownd both popes and cardinals oer whom avrice dominion absolute maintains i then mid such as these some needs must be whom i shall recognize that with the blot of these foul sins were staind he answering thus vain thought conceivst thou that ignoble life which made them vile before now makes them dark and to all knowledge indiscernible

set them at this strife which needs no labourd phrase of mine to set it off now mayst thou see my son how brief how vain the goods committed into fortunes hands for which the human race keep such a coil not all the gold that is beneath the moon or ever hath been of these toilworn souls might purchase rest for one i thus rejoind my guide of thee this also would i learn this fortune that thou

on her sphere and in her bliss exults now on our way pass we to heavier woe descending for each star is falling now that mounted at our entrance and forbids too long our tarrying we the circle crossd to the next steep arriving at a well that boiling pours itself down to a foss sluicd from its source far murkier was the wave than sablest grain and we in company of the inky waters journeying by their side enterd though by a different track beneath into a lake the stygian namd expands the dismal stream when it hath reachd the foot of the grey witherd cliffs intent i stood to gaze and in the marish sunk descried a miry tribe all naked and with looks betokning rage they with their hands alone struck not but with the head the breast the feet cutting each other piecemeal with their fangs the good instructor spake now seest thou son the souls of those whom anger overcame this too for certain know that underneath the water dwells a multitude whose sighs into these bubbles make the surface heave as thine eye tells thee wheresoeer it turn fixd in the slime they say sad once were we in the sweet air made gladsome by the sun carrying a foul and lazy mist within now in these murky settlings are we sad such dolorous strain they gurgle in their throats but word distinct can utter none our route thus compassd we a segment widely stretchd between the dry embankment and the core of the loathd pool turning meanwhile our eyes downward on those who gulpd its muddy lees nor stoppd till to a towers low base we came canto viii my theme pursuing i relate that ere we reachd the lofty turrets base our eyes its height ascended where two cressets hung we markd and from afar another light return the signal so remote that scarce the eye could catch its beam i turning round to the deep source of knowledge thus inquird say what this means and what that other light in answer set what agency doth this there on the filthy waters he replied een now what next awaits us mayst thou see if the marshgenderd fog conceal it not never was arrow from the cord dismissd that ran its way so nimbly through the air as a small bark that through the waves i spied toward us coming under the sole sway of one that ferried it who cried aloud art thou arrivd fell spiritphlegyas phlegyas this time thou criest in vain my lord replied no longer shalt thou have us but while oer the slimy pool we pass as one who hears of some great wrong he hath sustaind whereat inly he pines so phlegyas inly pind in his fierce ire my guide descending steppd into the skiff and bade me enter next close at his side nor till my entrance seemd the vessel freighted soon as both embarkd cutting the waves goes on the ancient prow more deeply than with others it is wont while we our course oer the dead channel held one drenchd in mire before me came and said who art thou that thou comest ere thine hour i answerd though i come i tarry not but who art thou that art become so foul one as thou seest who mourn he straight replied to which i thus in mourning and in woe cursd spirit tarry thou i know thee well een thus in filth disguisd then stretchd he forth hands to the bark whereof my teacher sage aware thrusting him back away down there to the other dogs then with his arms my neck encircling kissd my cheek and spake o soul justly disdainful blest was she in whom thou was conceivd he in the world was one for arrogance noted to his memory no virtue lends its lustre even so here is his shadow furious there above how many now hold themselves mighty kings who here like swine shall wallow in the mire leaving behind them horrible dispraise i then master him fain would i behold whelmd in these dregs before we quit the lake he thus or ever to thy view the shore be offerd satisfied shall be that wish which well deserves completion scarce his words were ended when i saw the miry tribes set on him with such violence that yet for that render i thanks to god and praise to filippo argenti cried they all and on himself the moody florentine turnd his avenging fangs him here we left nor speak i of him more but on mine ear sudden a sound of lamentation smote whereat mine eye unbarrd i sent abroad and thus the good instructor now my son draws near the city that of dis is namd with its grave denizens a mighty throng i thus the minarets already sir there certes in the valley i descry gleaming vermilion as if they from fire had issud he replied eternal fire that inward burns shows them with ruddy flame illumd as in this nether hell thou seest we came within the fosses deep that moat this region comfortless the walls appeard as they were framd of iron we had made wide circuit ere a place we reachd where loud the mariner cried vehement go forth the entrance is here upon the gates i spied more than a thousand who of old from heaven were hurld with ireful gestures who is this they cried that without death first felt goes through the regions of the dead my sapient guide made sign that he for secret parley wishd whereat their angry scorn abating thus they spake come thou alone and let him go who hath so hardily enterd this realm alone return he by his witless way if well he know it let him prove for thee here shalt thou tarry who through clime so dark hast been his escort now bethink thee reader what cheer was mine at sound of those cursd words i did believe i never should return o my lovd guide who more than seven times security hast renderd me and drawn from peril deep whereto i stood exposd desert me not i cried in this extreme and if our onward going be denied together trace we back our steps with speed my liege who thither had conducted me replied fear not for of our passage none hath power to disappoint us by such high authority permitted but do thou expect me here meanwhile thy wearied spirit comfort and feed with kindly hope assurd i will not leave thee in this lower world this said departs the sire benevolent and quits me hesitating i remain at war twixt will and will not in my thoughts i could not hear what terms he offerd them but they conferrd not long for all at once to trial fled within closd were the gates by those our adversaries on the breast of my liege lord excluded he returnd to me with tardy steps upon the ground his eyes were bent and from his brow erasd all confidence while thus with sighs he spake who hath denied me these abodes of woe then thus to me that i am angerd think no ground of terror in this trial i shall vanquish use what arts they may within for hindrance this their insolence not new erewhile at gate less secret they displayd which still is without bolt upon its arch thou sawst the deadly scroll and even now on this side of its entrance down the steep passing the circles unescorted comes one whose strong might can open us this land canto ix the hue which coward dread on my pale cheeks imprinted when i saw my guide turn back chasd that from his which newly they had worn and inwardly restraind it he as one who listens stood attentive for his eye not far could lead him through the sable air and the thickgathring cloud it yet behooves we win this fightthus he beganif not such aid to us is offerdoh how long me seems it ere the promisd help arrive i noted how the sequel of his words clokd their beginning for the last he spake agreed not with the first but not the less my fear was at his saying sith i drew to import worse perchance than that he held his mutilated speech doth ever any into this rueful concaves extreme depth descend out of the first degree whose pain is deprivation merely of sweet hope thus i inquiring rarely he replied it chances that among us any makes this journey which i wend erewhile tis true once came i here beneath conjurd by fell erictho sorceress who compelld the shades back to their bodies no long space my flesh was naked of me when within these walls she made me enter to draw forth a spirit from out of judas circle lowest place is that of all obscurest and removd farthest from heavns allcircling orb the road full well i know thou therefore rest secure that lake the noisome stench exhaling round the city of grief encompasses which now we may not enter without rage yet more he added but i hold it not in mind for that mine eye toward the lofty tower had drawn me wholly to its burning top where in an instant i beheld uprisen at once three hellish furies staind with blood in limb and motion feminine they seemd around them greenest hydras twisting rolld their volumes adders and cerastes crept instead of hair and their fierce temples bound he knowing well the miserable hags who tend the queen of endless woe thus spake mark thou each dire erinnys to the left this is megaera on the right hand she who wails alecto and tisiphone i th midst this said in silence he remaind their breast they each one clawing tore themselves smote with their palms and such shrill clamour raisd that to the bard i clung suspicionbound hasten medusa so to adamant him shall we change all looking down exclaimd een when by theseus might assaild we took no ill revenge turn thyself round and keep thy countnance hid for if the gorgon dire be shown and thou shouldst view it thy return upwards would be for ever lost this said himself my gentle master turnd me round nor trusted he my hands but with his own he also hid me ye of intellect sound and entire mark well the lore conceald under close texture of the mystic strain and now there came oer the perturbed waves loudcrashing terrible a sound that made either shore tremble as if of a wind impetuous from conflicting vapours sprung that gainst some forest driving all its might plucks off the branches beats them down and hurls afar then onward passing proudly sweeps its whirlwind rage while beasts and shepherds fly mine eyes he loosd and spake and now direct thy visual nerve along that ancient foam there thickest where the smoke ascends as frogs before their foe the serpent through the wave ply swiftly all till at the ground each one lies on a heap more than a thousand spirits destroyd so saw i fleeing before one who passd with unwet feet the stygian sound he from his face removing the gross air oft his left hand forth stretchd and seemd alone by that annoyance wearied i perceivd that he was sent from heavn and to my guide turnd me who signal made that i should stand quiet and bend to him ah me how full of noble anger seemd he to the gate he came and with his wand touchd it whereat open without impediment it flew outcasts of heavn o abject race and scornd began he on the horrid grunsel standing whence doth this wild excess of insolence lodge in you wherefore kick you gainst that will neer frustrate of its end and which so oft hath laid on you enforcement of your pangs what profits at the fays to but the horn your cerberus if ye remember hence bears still peeld of their hair his throat and maw this said he turnd back oer the filthy way and syllable to us spake none but wore the semblance of a man by other care beset and keenly pressd than thought of him who in his presence stands then we our steps toward that territory movd secure after the hallowd words we unopposd there enterd and my mind eager to learn what state a fortress like to that might hold i soon as enterd throw mine eye around and see on every part widestretching space replete with bitter pain and torment ill as where rhone stagnates on the plains of arles or as at pola near quarnaros gulf that closes italy and laves her bounds the place is all thick spread with sepulchres so was it here save what in horror here excelld for midst the graves were scattered flames wherewith intensely all throughout they burnd that iron for no craft there hotter needs their lids all hung suspended and beneath from them forth issud lamentable moans such as the sad and torturd well might raise i thus master say who are these interrd within these vaults of whom distinct we hear the dolorous sighs he answer thus returnd the archheretics are here accompanied by every sect their followers and much more than thou believest tombs are freighted like with like is buried and the monuments are different in degrees of heat this said he to the right hand turning on we passd betwixt the afflicted and the ramparts high canto x now by a secret pathway we proceed between the walls that hem the region round and the tormented souls my master first i close behind his steps virtue supreme i thus began who through these ample orbs in circuit leadst me even as thou willst speak thou and satisfy my wish may those who lie within these sepulchres be seen already all the lids are raisd and none oer them keeps watch he thus in answer spake they shall be closed all whattime they here from josaphat returnd shall come and bring their bodies which above they now have left the cemetery on this part obtain with epicurus all his followers who with the body make the spirit die here therefore satisfaction shall be soon both to the question askd and to the wish which thou concealst in silence i replied i keep not guide belovd from thee my heart secreted but to shun vain length of words a lesson erewhile taught me by thyself o tuscan thou who through the city of fire alive art passing so discreet of speech here please thee stay awhile thy utterance declares the place of thy nativity to be that noble land with which perchance i too severely dealt sudden that sound forth issud from a vault whereat in fear i somewhat closer to my leaders side approaching he thus spake what dost thou turn lo farinata there who hath himself uplifted from his girdle upwards all exposd behold him on his face was mine already fixd his breast and forehead there erecting seemd as in high scorn he held een hell between the sepulchres to him my guide thrust me with fearless hands and prompt this warning added see thy words be clear he soon as there i stood at the tombs foot eyd me a space then in disdainful mood addressd me say what ancestors were thine i willing to obey him straight reveald the whole nor kept back aught whence he his brow somewhat uplifting cried fiercely were they adverse to me my party and the blood from whence i sprang twice therefore i abroad scatterd them though drivn out yet they each time from all parts answerd i returnd an art which yours have shown they are not skilld to learn then peering forth from the unclosed jaw rose from his side a shade high as the chin leaning methought upon its knees upraisd it lookd around as eager to explore if there were other with me but perceiving that fond imagination quenchd with tears thus spake if thou through this blind prison gost led by thy lofty genius and profound where is my son and wherefore not with thee i straight replied not of myself i come by him who there expects me through this clime conducted whom perchance guido thy son had in contempt already had his words and mode of punishment read me his name whence i so fully answerd he at once exclaimd up starting how saidst thou he had no longer lives he strikes not on his eye the blessed daylight then of some delay i made ere my reply aware down fell supine not after forth appeard he more meanwhile the other great of soul near whom i yet was stationd changd not countnance stern nor movd the neck nor bent his ribbed side and if continuing the first discourse they in this art he cried small skill have shown that doth torment me more een than this bed but not yet fifty times shall be relumd her aspect who reigns here queen of this realm ere thou shalt know the full weight of that art so to the pleasant world mayst thou return as thou shalt tell me why in all their laws against my kin this people is so fell the slaughter and great havoc i replied that colourd arbias flood with crimson stain to these impute that in our hallowd dome such orisons ascend sighing he shook the head then thus resumd in that affray i stood not singly nor without just cause assuredly should with the rest have stirrd but singly there i stood when by consent of all florence had to the ground been razd the one who openly forbad the deed so may thy lineage find at last repose i thus adjurd him as thou solve this knot which now involves my mind if right i hear ye seem to view beforehand that which time leads with him of the present uninformd we view as one who hath an evil sight he answerd plainly objects far remote so much of his large spendour yet imparts the almighty ruler but when they approach or actually exist our intellect then wholly fails nor of your human state except what others bring us know we aught hence therefore mayst thou understand that all our knowledge in that instant shall expire when on futurity the portals close then conscious of my fault and by remorse smitten i added thus now shalt thou say to him there fallen that his offspring still is to the living joind and bid him know that if from answer silent i abstaind twas that my thought was occupied intent upon that error which thy help hath solvd but now my master summoning me back i heard and with more eager haste besought the spirit to inform me who with him partook his lot he answer thus returnd more than a thousand with me here are laid within is frederick second of that name and the lord cardinal and of the rest i speak not he this said from sight withdrew but i my steps towards the ancient bard reverting ruminated on the words betokening me such ill onward he movd and thus in going questiond whence the amaze that holds thy senses wrapt i satisfied the inquiry and the sage enjoind me straight let thy safe memory store what thou hast heard to thee importing harm and note thou this with his raisd finger bidding me take heed when thou shalt stand before her gracious beam whose bright eye all surveys she of thy life the future tenour will to thee unfold forthwith he to the left hand turnd his feet we left the wall and towrds the middle space went by a path that to a valley strikes which een thus high exhald its noisome steam canto xi upon the utmost verge of a high bank by craggy rocks environd round we came where woes beneath more cruel yet were stowd and here to shun the horrible excess of fetid exhalation upward cast from the profound abyss behind the lid of a great monument we stood retird whereon this scroll i markd i have in charge pope anastasius whom photinus drew from the right pathere our descent behooves we make delay that somewhat first the sense to the dire breath accustomd afterward regard it not my master thus to whom answering i spake some compensation find that the time past not wholly lost he then lo how my thoughts een to thy wishes tend my son within these rocks he thus began are three close circles in gradation placd as these which now thou leavst each one is full of spirits accursd but that the sight alone hereafter may suffice thee listen how and for what cause in durance they abide of all malicious act abhorrd in heaven the end is injury and all such end either by force or fraud works others woe but fraud because of man peculiar evil to god is more displeasing and beneath the fraudulent are therefore doomd to endure severer pang the violent occupy all the first circle and because to force three persons are obnoxious in three rounds each within other seprate is it framd to god his neighbour and himself by man force may be offerd to himself i say and his possessions as thou soon shalt hear at full death violent death and painful wounds upon his neighbour he inflicts and wastes by devastation pillage and the flames his substance slayers and each one that smites in malice plundrers and all robbers hence the torment undergo of the first round in different herds man can do violence to himself and his own blessings and for this he in the second round must aye deplore with unavailing penitence his crime whoeer deprives himself of life and light in reckless lavishment his talent wastes and sorrows there where he should dwell in joy to god may force be offerd in the heart denying and blaspheming his high power and nature with her kindly law contemning and thence the inmost round marks with its seal sodom and cahors and all such as speak contemptuously of the godhead in their hearts fraud that in every conscience leaves a sting may be by man employd on one whose trust he wins or on another who withholds strict confidence seems as the latter way broke but the bond of love which nature makes whence in the second circle have their nest dissimulation witchcraft flatteries theft falsehood simony all who seduce to lust or set their honesty at pawn with such vile scum as these the other way forgets both natures general love and that which thereto added afterwards gives birth to special faith whence in the lesser circle point of the universe dread seat of dis the traitor is eternally consumd i thus instructor clearly thy discourse proceeds distinguishing the hideous chasm and its inhabitants with skill exact but tell me this they of the dull fat pool whom the rain beats or whom the tempest drives or who with tongues so fierce conflicting meet wherefore within the city fireillumd are not these punishd if gods wrath be on them and if it be not wherefore in such guise are they condemned he answer thus returnd wherefore in dotage wanders thus thy mind not so accustomd or what other thoughts possess it dwell not in thy memory the words wherein thy ethic page describes three dispositions adverse to heavns will incontnence malice and mad brutishness and how incontinence the least offends god and least guilt incurs if well thou note this judgment and remember who they are without these walls to vain repentance doomd thou shalt discern why they apart are placd from these fell spirits and less wreakful pours justice divine on them its vengeance down o sun who healest all imperfect sight thou so contentst me when thou solvst my doubt that ignorance not less than knowledge charms yet somewhat turn thee back i in these words continud where thou saidst that usury offends celestial goodness and this knot perplexd unravel he thus made reply philosophy to an attentive ear clearly points out not in one part alone how imitative nature takes her course from the celestial mind and from its art and where her laws the stagyrite unfolds not many leaves scannd oer observing well thou shalt discover that your art on her obsequious follows as the learner treads in his instructors step so that your art deserves the name of second in descent from god these two if thou recall to mind creations holy book from the beginning were the right source of life and excellence to human kind but in another path the usurer walks and nature in herself and in her follower thus he sets at nought placing elsewhere his hope but follow now my steps on forward journey bent for now the pisces play with undulating glance along the horizon and the wain lies all oer the northwest and onward there a space is our steep passage down the rocky height canto xii the place where to descend the precipice we came was rough as alp and on its verge such object lay as every eye would shun as is that ruin which adices stream on this side trento struck shouldring the wave or loosd by earthquake or for lack of prop for from the mountains summit whence it movd to the low level so the headlong rock is shiverd that some passage it might give to him who from above would pass een such into the chasm was that descent and there at point of the disparted ridge lay stretchd the infamy of crete detested brood of the feignd heifer and at sight of us it gnawd itself as one with rage distract to him my guide exclaimd perchance thou deemst the king of athens here who in the world above thy death contrivd monster avaunt he comes not tutord by thy sisters art but to behold your torments is he come like to a bull that with impetuous spring darts at the moment when the fatal blow hath struck him but unable to proceed plunges on either side so saw i plunge the minotaur whereat the sage exclaimd run to the passage while he storms t is well that thou descend thus down our road we took through those dilapidated crags that oft movd underneath my feet to weight like theirs unusd i pondring went and thus he spake perhaps thy thoughts are of this ruind steep guarded by the brute violence which i have vanquishd now know then that when i erst hither descended to the nether hell this rock was not yet fallen but past doubt if well i mark not long ere he arrived who carried off from dis the mighty spoil of the highest circle then through all its bounds such trembling seizd the deep concave and foul i thought the universe was thrilld with love whereby there are who deem the world hath oft been into chaos turnd and in that point here and elsewhere that old rock toppled down but fix thine eyes beneath the river of blood approaches in the which all those are steepd who have by violence injurd o blind lust o foolish wrath who so dost goad us on in the brief life and in the eternal then thus miserably oerwhelm us i beheld an ample foss that in a bow was bent as circling all the plain for so my guide had told between it and the ramparts base on trail ran centaurs with keen arrows armd as to the chase they on the earth were wont at seeing us descend they each one stood and issuing from the troop three sped with bows and missile weapons chosen first of whom one cried from far say to what pain ye come condemnd who down this steep have journied speak from whence ye stand or else the bow i draw to whom my guide our answer shall be made to chiron there when nearer him we come ill was thy mind thus ever quick and rash then me he touchd and spake nessus is this who for the fair deianira died and wrought himself revenge for his own fate he in the midst that on his breast looks down is the great chiron who achilles nursd that other pholus prone to wrath around the foss these go by thousands aiming shafts at whatsoever spirit dares emerge from out the blood more than his guilt allows we to those beasts that rapid strode along drew near when chiron took an arrow forth and with the notch pushd back his shaggy beard to the cheekbone then his great mouth to view exposing to his fellows thus exclaimd are ye aware that he who comes behind moves what he touches the feet of the dead are not so wont my trusty guide who now stood near his breast where the two natures join thus made reply he is indeed alive and solitary so must needs by me be shown the gloomy vale thereto inducd by strict necessity not by delight she left her joyful harpings in the sky who this new office to my care consignd he is no robber no dark spirit i but by that virtue which empowers my step to treat so wild a path grant us i pray one of thy band whom we may trust secure who to the ford may lead us and convey across him mounted on his back for he is not a spirit that may walk the air then on his right breast turning chiron thus to nessus spake return and be their guide and if ye chance to cross another troop command them keep aloof onward we movd the faithful escort by our side along the border of the crimsonseething flood whence from those steepd within loud shrieks arose some there i markd as high as to their brow immersd of whom the mighty centaur thus these are the souls of tyrants who were given to blood and rapine here they wail aloud their merciless wrongs here alexander dwells and dionysius fell who many a year of woe wrought for fair sicily that brow whereon the hair so jetty clustring hangs is azzolino that with flaxen locks obizzo of este in the world destroyd by his foul stepson to the bard reverd i turned me round and thus he spake let him be to thee now first leader me but next to him in rank then farther on a space the centaur pausd near some who at the throat were extant from the wave and showing us a spirit by itself apart retird exclaimd he in gods bosom smote the heart which yet is honourd on the bank of thames a race i next espied who held the head and even all the bust above the stream midst these i many a face rememberd well thus shallow more and more the blood became so that at last it but imbrud the feet and there our passage lay athwart the foss as ever on this side the boiling wave thou seest diminishing the centaur said so on the other be thou well assurd it lower still and lower sinks its bed till in that part it reuniting join where t is the lot of tyranny to mourn there heavns stern justice lays chastising hand on attila who was the scourge of earth on sextus and on pyrrhus and extracts tears ever by the seething flood unlockd from the rinieri of corneto this pazzo the other namd who filld the ways with violence and war this said he turnd and quitting us alone repassd the ford canto xiii ere nessus yet had reachd the other bank we enterd on a forest where no track of steps had worn a way not verdant there the foliage but of dusky hue not light the boughs and tapering but with knares deformd and matted thick fruits there were none but thorns instead with venom filld less sharp than these less intricate the brakes wherein abide those animals that hate the culturd fields betwixt corneto and cecinas stream here the brute harpies make their nest the same who from the strophades the trojan band drove with dire boding of their future woe broad are their pennons of the human form their neck and countnance armd with talons keen the feet and the huge belly fledge with wings these sit and wail on the drear mystic wood the kind instructor in these words began ere farther thou proceed know thou art now i th second round and shalt be till thou come upon the horrid sand look therefore well around thee and such things thou shalt behold as would my speech discredit on all sides i heard sad plainings breathe and none could see from whom they might have issud in amaze fast bound i stood he as it seemd believd that i had thought so many voices came from some amid those thickets close conceald and thus his speech resumd if thou lop off a single twig from one of those ill plants the thought thou hast conceivd shall vanish quite thereat a little stretching forth my hand from a great wilding gatherd i a branch and straight the trunk exclaimd why pluckst thou me then as the dark blood trickled down its side these words it added wherefore tearst me thus is there no touch of mercy in thy breast men once were we that now are rooted here thy hand might well have spard us had we been the souls of serpents as a brand yet green that burning at one end from the other sends a groaning sound and hisses with the wind that forces out its way so burst at once forth from the broken splinter words and blood i letting fall the bough remaind as one assaild by terror and the sage replied if he o injurd spirit could have believd what he hath seen but in my verse describd he never against thee had stretchd his hand but i because the thing surpassd belief prompted him to this deed which even now myself i rue but tell me who thou wast that for this wrong to do thee some amends in the upper world for thither to return is granted him thy fame he may revive that pleasant word of thine the trunk replied hath so inveigled me that i from speech cannot refrain wherein if i indulge a little longer in the snare detaind count it not grievous i it was who held both keys to fredericks heart and turnd the wards opening and shutting with a skill so sweet that besides me into his inmost breast scarce any other could admittance find the faith i bore to my high charge was such it cost me the lifeblood that warmd my veins the harlot who neer turnd her gloating eyes from caesars household common vice and pest of courts gainst me inflamd the minds of all and to augustus they so spread the flame that my glad honours changd to bitter woes my soul disdainful and disgusted sought refuge in death from scorn and i became just as i was unjust toward myself by the new roots which fix this stem i swear that never faith i broke to my liege lord who merited such honour and of you if any to the world indeed return clear he from wrong my memory that lies yet prostrate under envys cruel blow first somewhat pausing till the mournful words were ended then to me the bard began lose not the time but speak and of him ask if more thou wish to learn whence i replied question thou him again of whatsoeer will as thou thinkst content me for no power have i to ask such pity is at my heart he thus resumd so may he do for thee freely what thou entreatest as thou yet be pleasd imprisond spirit to declare how in these gnarled joints the soul is tied and whether any ever from such frame be loosend if thou canst that also tell thereat the trunk breathd hard and the wind soon changd into sounds articulate like these briefly ye shall be answerd when departs the fierce soul from the body by itself thence torn asunder to the seventh gulf by minos doomd into the wood it falls no place assignd but wheresoever chance hurls it there sprouting as a grain of spelt it rises to a sapling growing thence a savage plant the harpies on its leaves then feeding cause both pain and for the pain a vent to grief we as the rest shall come for our own spoils yet not so that with them we may again be clad for what a man takes from himself it is not just he have here we perforce shall drag them and throughout the dismal glade our bodies shall be hung each on the wild thorn of his wretched shade attentive yet to listen to the trunk we stood expecting farther speech when us a noise surprisd as when a man perceives the wild boar and the hunt approach his place of stationd watch who of the beasts and boughs loud rustling round him hears and lo there came two naked torn with briers in headlong flight that they before them broke each fan o th wood haste now the foremost cried now haste thee death the other as seemd impatient of delay exclaiming lano not so bent for speed thy sinews in the lists of toppos field and then for that perchance no longer breath sufficd him of himself and of a bush one group he made behind them was the wood full of black female mastiffs gaunt and fleet as greyhounds that have newly slippd the leash on him who squatted down they stuck their fangs and having rent him piecemeal bore away the torturd limbs my guide then seizd my hand and led me to the thicket which in vain mournd through its bleeding wounds o giacomo of sant andrea what avails it thee it cried that of me thou hast made thy screen for thy ill life what blame on me recoils when oer it he had pausd my master spake say who wast thou that at so many points breathst out with blood thy lamentable speech he answerd oh ye spirits arrivd in time to spy the shameful havoc that from me my leaves hath severd thus gather them up and at the foot of their sad parenttree carefully lay them in that city i dwelt who for the baptist her first patron changd whence he for this shall cease not with his art to work her woe and if there still remaind not on arnos passage some faint glimpse of him those citizens who reard once more her walls upon the ashes left by attila had labourd without profit of their toil i slung the fatal noose from my own roof canto xiv soon as the charity of native land wrought in my bosom i the scatterd leaves collected and to him restord who now was hoarse with uttrance to the limit thence we came which from the third the second round divides and where of justice is displayd contrivance horrible things then first seen clearlier to manifest i tell how next a plain we reachd that from its sterile bed each plant repelld the mournful wood waves round its garland on all sides as round the wood spreads the sad foss there on the very edge our steps we stayd it was an area wide of arid sand and thick resembling most the soil that erst by catos foot was trod vengeance of heavn oh how shouldst thou be feard by all who read what here my eyes beheld of naked spirits many a flock i saw all weeping piteously to different laws subjected for on the earth some lay supine some crouching close were seated others pacd incessantly around the latter tribe more numerous those fewer who beneath the torment lay but louder in their grief oer all the sand fell slowly wafting down dilated flakes of fire as flakes of snow on alpine summit when the wind is hushd as in the torrid indian clime the son of ammon saw upon his warrior band descending solid flames that to the ground came down whence he bethought him with his troop to trample on the soil for easier thus the vapour was extinguishd while alone so fell the eternal fiery flood wherewith the marble glowd underneath as under stove the viands doubly to augment the pain unceasing was the play of wretched hands now this now that way glancing to shake off the heat still falling fresh i thus began instructor thou who all things overcomst except the hardy demons that rushd forth to stop our entrance at the gate say who is yon huge spirit that as seems heeds not the burning but lies writhen in proud scorn as by the sultry tempest immaturd straight he himself who was aware i askd my guide of him exclaimd such as i was when living dead such now i am if jove weary his workman out from whom in ire he snatchd the lightnings that at my last day transfixd me if the rest be weary out at their black smithy labouring by turns in mongibello while he cries aloud help help good mulciber as erst he cried in the phlegraean warfare and the bolts launch he full aimd at me with all his might he never should enjoy a sweet revenge then thus my guide in accent higher raisd than i before had heard him capaneus thou art more punishd in that this thy pride lives yet unquenchd no torrent save thy rage were to thy fury pain proportiond full next turning round to me with milder lip he spake this of the seven kings was one who girt the theban walls with siege and held as still he seems to hold god in disdain and sets his high omnipotence at nought but as i told him his despiteful mood is ornament well suits the breast that wears it follow me now and look thou set not yet thy foot in the hot sand but to the wood keep ever close silently on we passd to where there gushes from the forests bound a little brook whose crimsond wave yet lifts my hair with horror as the rill that runs from bulicame to be portiond out among the sinful women so ran this down through the sand its bottom and each bank stonebuilt and either margin at its side whereon i straight perceivd our passage lay of all that i have shown thee since that gate we enterd first whose threshold is to none denied nought else so worthy of regard as is this river has thine eye discernd oer which the flaming volley all is quenchd so spake my guide and i him thence besought that having givn me appetite to know the food he too would give that hunger cravd in midst of ocean forthwith he began a desolate country lies which crete is namd under whose monarch in old times the world livd pure and chaste a mountain rises there calld ida joyous once with leaves and streams deserted now like a forbidden thing it was the spot which rhea saturns spouse chose for the secret cradle of her son and better to conceal him drownd in shouts his infant cries within the mount upright an ancient form there stands and huge that turns his shoulders towards damiata and at rome as in his mirror looks of finest gold his head is shapd pure silver are the breast and arms thence to the middle is of brass and downward all beneath welltemperd steel save the right foot of potters clay on which than on the other more erect he stands each part except the gold is rent throughout and from the fissure tears distil which joind penetrate to that cave they in their course thus far precipitated down the rock form acheron and styx and phlegethon then by this straitend channel passing hence beneath een to the lowest depth of all form there cocytus of whose lake thyself shall see it i here give thee no account then i to him if from our world this sluice be thus derivd wherefore to us but now appears it at this edge he straight replied the place thou knowst is round and though great part thou have already passd still to the left descending to the nethermost not yet hast thou the circuit made of the whole orb wherefore if aught of new to us appear it needs not bring up wonder in thy looks then i again inquird where flow the streams of phlegethon and lethe for of one thou tellst not and the other of that shower thou sayst is formd he answer thus returnd doubtless thy questions all well pleasd i hear yet the red seething wave might have resolvd one thou proposest lethe thou shalt see but not within this hollow in the place whither to lave themselves the spirits go whose blame hath been by penitence removd he added time is now we quit the wood look thou my steps pursue the margins give safe passage unimpeded by the flames for over them all vapour is extinct canto xv one of the solid margins bears us now envelopd in the mist that from the stream arising hovers oer and saves from fire both piers and water as the flemings rear their mound twixt ghent and bruges to chase back the ocean fearing his tumultuous tide that drives toward them or the paduans theirs along the brenta to defend their towns and castles ere the genial warmth be felt on chiarentanas top such were the mounds so framd though not in height or bulk to these made equal by the master whosoeer he was that raisd them here we from the wood were not so far removd that turning round i might not have discernd it when we met a troop of spirits who came beside the pier they each one eyd us as at eventide one eyes another under a new moon and toward us sharpend their sight as keen as an old tailor at his needles eye thus narrowly explord by all the tribe i was agnizd of one who by the skirt caught me and cried what wonder have we here and i when he to me outstretchd his arm intently fixd my ken on his parchd looks that although smirchd with fire they hinderd not but i rememberd him and towards his face my hand inclining answerd sir brunetto and art thou here he thus to me my son oh let it not displease thee if brunetto latini but a little space with thee turn back and leave his fellows to proceed i thus to him replied much as i can i thereto pray thee and if thou be willing that i here seat me with thee i consent his leave with whom i journey first obtaind o son said he whoever of this throng one instant stops lies then a hundred years no fan to ventilate him when the fire smites sorest pass thou therefore on i close will at thy garments walk and then rejoin my troop who go mourning their endless doom i dard not from the path descend to tread on equal ground with him but held my head bent down as one who walks in reverent guise what chance or destiny thus he began ere the last day conducts thee here below and who is this that shows to thee the way there up aloft i answerd in the life serene i wanderd in a valley lost before mine age had to its fullness reachd but yestermorn i left it then once more into that vale returning him i met and by this path homeward he leads me back if thou he answerd follow but thy star thou canst not miss at last a glorious haven unless in fairer days my judgment errd and if my fate so early had not chancd seeing the heavns thus bounteous to thee i had gladly givn thee comfort in thy work but that ungrateful and malignant race who in old times came down from fesole ay and still smack of their rough mountainflint will for thy good deeds shew thee enmity nor wonder for amongst illsavourd crabs it suits not the sweet figtree lay her fruit old fame reports them in the world for blind covetous envious proud look to it well take heed thou cleanse thee of their ways for thee thy fortune hath such honour in reserve that thou by either party shalt be cravd with hunger keen but be the fresh herb far from the goats tooth the herd of fesole may of themselves make litter not touch the plant if any such yet spring on their rank bed in which the holy seed revives transmitted from those true romans who still there remaind when it was made the nest of so much ill were all my wish fulfilld i straight replied thou from the confines of mans nature yet hadst not been driven forth for in my mind is fixd and now strikes full upon my heart the dear benign paternal image such as thine was when so lately thou didst teach me the way for man to win eternity and how i prizd the lesson it behooves that long as life endures my tongue should speak what of my fate thou tellst that write i down and with another text to comment on for her i keep it the celestial dame who will know all if i to her arrive this only would i have thee clearly note that so my conscience have no plea against me do fortune as she list i stand prepard not new or strange such earnest to mine ear speed fortune then her wheel as likes her best the clown his mattock all things have their course thereat my sapient guide upon his right turnd himself back then lookd at me and spake he listens to good purpose who takes note i not the less still on my way proceed discoursing with brunetto and inquire who are most known and chief among his tribe to know of some is well thus he replied but of the rest silence may best beseem time would not serve us for report so long in brief i tell thee that all these were clerks men of great learning and no less renown by one same sin polluted in the world with them is priscian and accorsos son francesco herds among that wretched throng and if the wish of so impure a blotch possessd thee him thou also mightst have seen who by the servants servant was transferrd from arnos seat to bacchiglione where his illstraind nerves he left i more would add but must from farther speech and onward way alike desist for yonder i behold a mist newrisen on the sandy plain a company with whom i may not sort approaches i commend my treasure to thee wherein i yet survive my sole request this said he turnd and seemd as one of those who oer veronas champain try their speed for the green mantle and of them he seemd not he who loses but who gains the prize canto xvi now came i where the waters din was heard as down it fell into the other round resounding like the hum of swarming bees when forth together issud from a troop that passd beneath the fierce tormenting storm three spirits running swift they towards us came and each one cried aloud oh do thou stay whom by the fashion of thy garb we deem to be some inmate of our evil land ah me what wounds i markd upon their limbs recent and old inflicted by the flames een the remembrance of them grieves me yet attentive to their cry my teacher pausd and turnd to me his visage and then spake wait now our courtesy these merit well and were t not for the nature of the place whence glide the fiery darts i should have said that haste had better suited thee than them they when we stoppd resumd their ancient wail and soon as they had reachd us all the three whirld round together in one restless wheel as naked champions smeard with slippery oil are wont intent to watch their place of hold and vantage ere in closer strife they meet thus each one as he wheeld his countenance at me directed so that opposite the neck movd ever to the twinkling feet if misery of this drear wilderness thus one began added to our sad cheer and destitute do call forth scorn on us and our entreaties let our great renown incline thee to inform us who thou art that dost imprint with living feet unharmd the soil of hell he in whose track thou seest my steps pursuing naked though he be and reft of all was of more high estate than thou believest grandchild of the chaste gualdrada him they guidoguerra calld who in his lifetime many a noble act achievd both by his wisdom and his sword the other next to me that beats the sand is aldobrandi name deserving well in the upper world of honour and myself who in this torment do partake with them am rusticucci whom past doubt my wife of savage temper more than aught beside hath to this evil brought if from the fire i had been shelterd down amidst them straight i then had cast me nor my guide i deem would have restraind my going but that fear of the dire burning vanquishd the desire which made me eager of their wishd embrace i then began not scorn but grief much more such as long time alone can cure your doom fixd deep within me soon as this my lord spake words whose tenour taught me to expect that such a race as ye are was at hand i am a countryman of yours who still affectionate have utterd and have heard your deeds and names renownd leaving the gall for the sweet fruit i go that a sure guide hath promisd to me but behooves that far as to the centre first i downward tend so may long space thy spirit guide thy limbs he answer straight returnd and so thy fame shine bright when thou art gone as thou shalt tell if courtesy and valour as they wont dwell in our city or have vanishd clean for one amidst us late condemnd to wail borsiere yonder walking with his peers grieves us no little by the news he brings an upstart multitude and sudden gains pride and excess o florence have in thee engenderd so that now in tears thou mournst thus cried i with my face upraisd and they all three who for an answer took my words lookd at each other as men look when truth comes to their ear if thou at other times they all at once rejoind so easily satisfy those who question happy thou gifted with words so apt to speak thy thought wherefore if thou escape this darksome clime returning to behold the radiant stars when thou with pleasure shalt retrace the past see that of us thou speak among mankind this said they broke the circle and so swift fled that as pinions seemd their nimble feet not in so short a time might one have said amen as they had vanishd straight my guide pursud his track i followd and small space had we passd onward when the waters sound was now so near at hand that we had scarce heard one anothers speech for the loud din een as the river that holds on its course unmingled from the mount of vesulo on the left side of apennine toward the east which acquacheta higher up they call ere it descend into the vale at forli by that name no longer known rebellows oer saint benedict rolld on from the alpine summit down a precipice where space enough to lodge a thousand spreads thus downward from a craggy steep we found that this dark wave resounded roaring loud so that the ear its clamour soon had stunnd i had a cord that bracd my girdle round wherewith i erst had thought fast bound to take the painted leopard this when i had all unloosend from me so my master bade i gatherd up and stretchd it forth to him then to the right he turnd and from the brink standing few paces distant cast it down into the deep abyss and somewhat strange thus to myself i spake signal so strange betokens which my guide with earnest eye thus follows ah what caution must men use with those who look not at the deed alone but spy into the thoughts with subtle skill quickly shall come he said what i expect thine eye discover quickly that whereof thy thought is dreaming ever to that truth which but the semblance of a falsehood wears a man if possible should bar his lip since although blameless he incurs reproach but silence here were vain and by these notes which now i sing reader i swear to thee so may they favour find to latest times that through the gross and murky air i spied a shape come swimming up that might have quelld the stoutest heart with wonder in such guise as one returns who hath been down to loose an anchor grappled fast against some rock or to aught else that in the salt wave lies who upward springing close draws in his feet canto xvii lo the fell monster with the deadly sting who passes mountains breaks through fenced walls and firm embattled spears and with his filth taints all the world thus me my guide addressd and beckond him that he should come to shore near to the stony causeways utmost edge forthwith that image vile of fraud appeard his head and upper part exposd on land but laid not on the shore his bestial train his face the semblance of a just mans wore so kind and gracious was its outward cheer the rest was serpent all two shaggy claws reachd to the armpits and the back and breast and either side were painted oer with nodes and orbits colours variegated more nor turks nor tartars eer on cloth of state with interchangeable embroidery wove nor spread arachne oer her curious loom as ofttimes a light skiff moord to the shore stands part in water part upon the land or as where dwells the greedy german boor the beaver settles watching for his prey so on the rim that fencd the sand with rock sat perchd the fiend of evil in the void glancing his tail upturnd its venomous fork with sting like scorpions armd then thus my guide now need our way must turn few steps apart far as to that ill beast who couches there thereat toward the right our downward course we shapd and better to escape the flame and burning marle ten paces on the verge proceeded soon as we to him arrive a little further on mine eye beholds a tribe of spirits seated on the sand near the wide chasm forthwith my master spake that to the full thy knowledge may extend of all this round contains go now and mark the mien these wear but hold not long discourse till thou returnest i with him meantime will parley that to us he may vouchsafe the aid of his strong shoulders thus alone yet forward on the extremity i pacd of that seventh circle where the mournful tribe were seated at the eyes forth gushd their pangs against the vapours and the torrid soil alternately their shifting hands they plied thus use the dogs in summer still to ply their jaws and feet by turns when bitten sore by gnats or flies or gadflies swarming round noting the visages of some who lay beneath the pelting of that dolorous fire one of them all i knew not but perceivd that pendent from his neck each bore a pouch with colours and with emblems various markd on which it seemd as if their eye did feed and when amongst them looking round i came a yellow purse i saw with azure wrought that wore a lions countenance and port then still my sight pursuing its career another i beheld than blood more red a goose display of whiter wing than curd and one who bore a fat and azure swine picturd on his white scrip addressed me thus what dost thou in this deep go now and know since yet thou livest that my neighbour here vitaliano on my left shall sit a paduan with these florentines am i ofttimes they thunder in mine ears exclaiming o haste that noble knight he who the pouch with the three beaks will bring this said he writhd the mouth and lolld the tongue out like an ox that licks his nostrils i lest longer stay he ill might brook who bade me stay not long backward my steps from those sad spirits turnd my guide already seated on the haunch of the fierce animal i found and thus he me encouragd be thou stout be bold down such a steep flight must we now descend mount thou before for that no power the tail may have to harm thee i will be i th midst as one who hath an ague fit so near his nails already are turnd blue and he quivers all oer if he but eye the shade such was my cheer at hearing of his words but shame soon interposd her threat who makes the servant bold in presence of his lord i settled me upon those shoulders huge and would have said but that the words to aid my purpose came not look thou clasp me firm but he whose succour then not first i provd soon as i mounted in his arms aloft embracing held me up and thus he spake geryon now move thee be thy wheeling gyres of ample circuit easy thy descent think on th unusual burden thou sustainst as a small vessel backning out from land her station quits so thence the monster loosd and when he felt himself at large turnd round there where the breast had been his forked tail thus like an eel outstretchd at length he steerd gathring the air up with retractile claws not greater was the dread when phaeton the reins let drop at random whence high heaven whereof signs yet appear was wrapt in flames nor when illfated icarus perceivd by liquefaction of the scalded wax the trusted pennons loosend from his loins his sire exclaiming loud ill way thou keepst than was my dread when round me on each part the air i viewd and other object none save the fell beast he slowly sailing wheels his downward motion unobservd of me but that the wind arising to my face breathes on me from below now on our right i heard the cataract beneath us leap with hideous crash whence bending down to explore new terror i conceivd at the steep plunge for flames i saw and wailings smote mine ear so that all trembling close i crouchd my limbs and then distinguishd unperceivd before by the dread torments that on every side drew nearer how our downward course we wound as falcon that hath long been on the wing but lure nor bird hath seen while in despair the falconer cries ah me thou stoopst to earth wearied descends and swiftly down the sky in many an orbit wheels then lighting sits at distance from his lord in angry mood so geryon lighting places us on foot low down at base of the deepfurrowd rock and of his burden there dischargd forthwith sprang forward like an arrow from the string canto xviii there is a place within the depths of hell calld malebolge all of rock darkstaind with hue ferruginous een as the steep that round it circling winds right in the midst of that abominable region yawns a spacious gulf profound whereof the frame due time shall tell the circle that remains throughout its round between the gulf and base of the high craggy banks successive forms ten trenches in its hollow bottom sunk as where to guard the walls full many a foss begirds some stately castle sure defence affording to the space within so here were modeld these and as like fortresses een from their threshold to the brink without are flankd with bridges from the rocks low base thus flinty paths advancd that cross the moles and dikes struck onward far as to the gulf that in one bound collected cuts them off such was the place wherein we found ourselves from geryons back dislodgd the bard to left held on his way and i behind him movd on our right hand new misery i saw new pains new executioners of wrath that swarming peopled the first chasm below were naked sinners hitherward they came meeting our faces from the middle point with us beyond but with a larger stride een thus the romans when the year returns of jubilee with better speed to rid the thronging multitudes their means devise for such as pass the bridge that on one side all front toward the castle and approach saint peters fane on th other towards the mount each divers way along the grisly rock hornd demons i beheld with lashes huge that on their back unmercifully smote ah how they made them bound at the first stripe none for the second waited nor the third meantime as on i passd one met my sight whom soon as viewd of him cried i not yet mine eye hath had his fill with fixed gaze i therefore scannd him straight the teacher kind pausd with me and consented i should walk backward a space and the tormented spirit who thought to hide him bent his visage down but it availd him nought for i exclaimd thou who dost cast thy eye upon the ground unless thy features do belie thee much venedico art thou but what brings thee into this bitter seasning he replied unwillingly i answer to thy words but thy clear speech that to my mind recalls the world i once inhabited constrains me know then twas i who led fair ghisola to do the marquis will however fame the shameful tale have bruited nor alone bologna hither sendeth me to mourn rather with us the place is so oerthrongd that not so many tongues this day are taught betwixt the reno and savenas stream to answer sipa in their countrys phrase and if of that securer proof thou need remember but our craving thirst for gold him speaking thus a demon with his thong struck and exclaimd away corrupter here women are none for sale forthwith i joind my escort and few paces thence we came to where a rock forth issued from the bank that easily ascended to the right upon its splinter turning we depart from those eternal barriers when arrivd where underneath the gaping arch lets pass the scourged souls pause here the teacher said and let these others miserable now strike on thy ken faces not yet beheld for that together they with us have walkd from the old bridge we eyd the pack who came from th other side towards us like the rest excoriate from the lash my gentle guide by me unquestiond thus his speech resumd behold that lofty shade who this way tends and seems too woebegone to drop a tear how yet the regal aspect he retains jason is he whose skill and prowess won the ram from colchos to the lemnian isle his passage thither led him when those bold and pitiless women had slain all their males there he with tokens and fair witching words hypsipyle beguild a virgin young who first had all the rest herself beguild impregnated he left her there forlorn such is the guilt condemns him to this pain here too medeas injries are avenged all bear him company who like deceit to his have practisd and thus much to know of the first vale suffice thee and of those whom its keen torments urge now had we come where crossing the next pier the straightend path bestrides its shoulders to another arch hence in the second chasm we heard the ghosts who jibber in low melancholy sounds with widestretchd nostrils snort and on themselves smite with their palms upon the banks a scurf from the foul steam condensd encrusting hung that held sharp combat with the sight and smell so hollow is the depth that from no part save on the summit of the rocky span could i distinguish aught thus far we came and thence i saw within the foss below a crowd immersd in ordure that appeard draff of the human body there beneath searching with eye inquisitive i markd one with his head so grimd twere hard to deem if he were clerk or layman loud he cried why greedily thus bendest more on me than on these other filthy ones thy ken because if true my memry i replied i heretofore have seen thee with dry locks and thou alessio art of lucca sprung therefore than all the rest i scan thee more then beating on his brain these words he spake me thus low down my flatteries have sunk wherewith i neer enough could glut my tongue my leader thus a little further stretch thy face that thou the visage well mayst note of that besotted sluttish courtezan who there doth rend her with defiled nails now crouching down now risen on her feet thais is this the harlot whose false lip answerd her doting paramour that askd thankest me muchsay rather wondrously and seeing this here satiate be our view canto xix woe to thee simon magus woe to you his wretched followers who the things of god which should be wedded unto goodness them rapacious as ye are do prostitute for gold and silver in adultery now must the trumpet sound for you since yours is the third chasm upon the following vault we now had mounted where the rock impends directly oer the centre of the foss wisdom supreme how wonderful the art which thou dost manifest in heaven in earth and in the evil world how just a meed allotting by thy virtue unto all i saw the livid stone throughout the sides and in its bottom full of apertures all equal in their width and circular each nor ample less nor larger they appeard than in saint johns fair dome of me belovd those framd to hold the pure baptismal streams one of the which i brake some few years past to save a whelming infant and be this a seal to undeceive whoever doubts the motive of my deed from out the mouth of every one emergd a sinners feet and of the legs high upward as the calf the rest beneath was hid on either foot the soles were burning whence the flexile joints glancd with such violent motion as had snapt asunder cords or twisted withs as flame feeding on unctuous matter glides along the surface scarcely touching where it moves so here from heel to point glided the flames master say who is he than all the rest glancing in fiercer agony on whom a ruddier flame doth prey i thus inquird if thou be willing he replied that i carry thee down where least the slope bank falls he of himself shall tell thee and his wrongs i then as pleases thee to me is best thou art my lord and knowst that neer i quit thy will what silence hides that knowest thou thereat on the fourth pier we came we turnd and on our left descended to the depth a narrow strait and perforated close nor from his side my leader set me down till to his orifice he brought whose limb quivring expressd his pang whoeer thou art sad spirit thus reversd and as a stake drivn in the soil i in these words began if thou be able utter forth thy voice there stood i like the friar that doth shrive a wretch for murder doomd who een when fixd calleth him back whence death awhile delays he shouted ha already standest there already standest there o boniface by many a year the writing playd me false so early dost thou surfeit with the wealth for which thou fearedst not in guile to take the lovely lady and then mangle her i felt as those who piercing not the drift of answer made them stand as if exposd in mockery nor know what to reply when virgil thus admonishd tell him quick i am not he not he whom thou believst and i as was enjoind me straight replied that heard the spirit all did wrench his feet and sighing next in woeful accent spake what then of me requirest if to know so much imports thee who i am that thou hast therefore down the bank descended learn that in the mighty mantle i was robd and of a shebear was indeed the son so eager to advance my whelps that there my having in my purse above i stowd and here myself under my head are draggd the rest my predecessors in the guilt of simony stretchd at their length they lie along an opening in the rock midst them i also low shall fall soon as he comes for whom i took thee when so hastily i questiond but already longer time hath passd since my souls kindled and i thus upturnd have stood than is his doom to stand planted with fiery feet for after him one yet of deeds more ugly shall arrive from forth the west a shepherd without law fated to cover both his form and mine he a new jason shall be calld of whom in maccabees we read and favour such as to that priest his king indulgent showd shall be of frances monarch shown to him i know not if i here too far presumd but in this strain i answerd tell me now what treasures from st peter at the first our lord demanded when he put the keys into his charge surely he askd no more but follow me nor peter nor the rest or gold or silver of matthias took when lots were cast upon the forfeit place of the condemned soul abide thou then thy punishment of right is merited and look thou well to that illgotten coin which against charles thy hardihood inspird if reverence of the keys restraind me not which thou in happier time didst hold i yet severer speech might use your avarice oercasts the world with mourning under foot treading the good and raising bad men up of shepherds like to you th evangelist was ware when her who sits upon the waves with kings in filthy whoredom he beheld she who with seven heads towerd at her birth and from ten horns her proof of glory drew long as her spouse in virtue took delight of gold and silver ye have made your god diffring wherein from the idolater but he that worships one a hundred ye ah constantine to how much ill gave birth not thy conversion but that plenteous dower which the first wealthy father gaind from thee meanwhile as thus i sung he whether wrath or conscience smote him violent upsprang spinning on either sole i do believe my teacher well was pleasd with so composd a lip he listend ever to the sound of the true words i utterd in both arms he caught and to his bosom lifting me upward retracd the way of his descent nor weary of his weight he pressd me close till to the summit of the rock we came our passage from the fourth to the fifth pier his cherishd burden there gently he placd upon the rugged rock and steep a path not easy for the clambring goat to mount thence to my view another vale appeard canto xx and now the verse proceeds to torments new fit argument of this the twentieth strain of the first song whose awful theme records the spirits whelmd in woe earnest i lookd into the depth that opend to my view moistend with tears of anguish and beheld a tribe that came along the hollow vale in silence weeping such their step as walk quires chanting solemn litanies on earth as on them more direct mine eye descends each wondrously seemd to be reversd at the neckbone so that the countenance was from the reins averted and because none might before him look they were compelld to advance with backward gait thus one perhaps hath been by force of palsy clean transposd but i neer saw it nor believe it so now reader think within thyself so god fruit of thy reading give thee how i long could keep my visage dry when i beheld near me our form distorted in such guise that on the hinder parts falln from the face the tears downstreaming rolld against a rock i leant and wept so that my guide exclaimd what and art thou too witless as the rest here pity most doth show herself alive when she is dead what guilt exceedeth his who with heavens judgment in his passion strives raise up thy head raise up and see the man before whose eyes earth gapd in thebes when all cried out amphiaraus whither rushest why leavest thou the war he not the less fell ruining far as to minos down whose grapple none eludes lo how he makes the breast his shoulders and who once too far

in thy guilt knowest thou any sprung of latian land under the tari parted he replied but now from one who sojournd not far thence so were i under shelter now with him nor hook nor talon then should

prevail against us all now reader of new sport expect to hear they each one turnd his eyes to the other shore he first who was the hardest to persuade the spirit of navarre chose well his time planted his feet on land and at one leap escaping disappointed their resolve them quick resentment stung but him the most who was the cause of failure in pursuit he therefore sped exclaiming thou art caught but little it availd terror outstrippd his following flight the other plungd beneath and he with upward pinion raisd his breast een thus the waterfowl when she perceives the falcon near dives instant

dyke in grapple close they joind but the other provd a goshawk able to rend well his foe and in the boiling lake both fell the heat was umpire soon between them but in vain to lift themselves they strove so fast were glued their pennons barbariccia as the rest that chance lamenting four in flight dispatchd from the other coast with all their weapons armd they to their post on each side speedily descending stretchd their hooks toward the fiends who flounderd inly burning from their scars and we departing left them to that broil canto xxiii in silence and in solitude we went one first the other following his steps as minor friars journeying on their road the present fray had turnd my thoughts to muse upon old aesops fable where he told what fate unto the mouse and frog befell for language hath not sounds more like in sense than are these chances if the origin and end of each be heedfully compard and as one thought bursts from another forth so afterward from that another sprang which added doubly to my former fear for thus i reasond these through us have been so foild with loss and mockry so complete as needs must sting them sore if anger then be to their evil will conjoind more fell they shall pursue us than the savage hound snatches the leveret panting twixt his jaws already i perceivd my hair stand all on end with terror and lookd eager back teacher i thus began if speedily thyself and me thou hide not much i dread those evil talons even now behind they urge us quick imagination works so forcibly that i already feel them he answerd were i formd of leaded glass i should not sooner draw unto myself thy outward image than i now imprint that from within this moment came thy thoughts presented before mine with similar act and countnance similar so that from both i one design have framd if the right coast incline so much that we may thence descend into the other chasm we shall escape secure from this imagined pursuit he had not spoke his purpose to the end when i from far beheld them with spread wings approach to take us suddenly my guide caught me evn as a mother that from sleep is by the noise arousd and near her sees the climbing fires who snatches up her babe and flies neer pausing careful more of him than of herself that but a single vest clings round her limbs down from the jutting beach supine he cast him to that pendent rock which closes on one part the other chasm never ran water with such hurrying pace adown the tube to turn a landmills wheel when nearest it approaches to the spokes as then along that edge my master ran carrying me in his bosom as a child not a companion scarcely had his feet reachd to the lowest of the bed beneath when over us the steep they reachd but fear in him was none for that high providence which placd them ministers of the fifth foss power of departing thence took from them all there in the depth we saw a painted tribe who pacd with tardy steps around and wept faint in appearance and oercome with toil caps had they on with hoods that fell low down before their eyes in fashion like to those worn by the monks in cologne their outside was overlaid with gold dazzling to view but leaden all within and of such weight that fredericks compard to these were straw oh everlasting wearisome attire we yet once more with them together turnd to leftward on their dismal moan intent but by the weight oppressd so slowly came the fainting people that our company was changd at every movement of the step whence i my guide addressd see that thou find some spirit whose name may by his deeds be known and to that end look round thee as thou gost then one who understood the tuscan voice cried after us aloud hold in your feet ye who so swiftly speed through the dusk air perchance from me thou shalt obtain thy wish whereat my leader turning me bespake pause and then onward at their pace proceed i staid and saw two spirits in whose look impatient eagerness of mind was markd to overtake me but the load they bare and narrow path retarded their approach soon as arrivd they with an eye askance perusd me but spake not then turning each to other thus conferring said this one seems by the action of his throat alive and be they dead what privilege allows they walk unmantled by the cumbrous stole then thus to me tuscan who visitest the college of the mourning hypocrites disdain not to instruct us who thou art by arnos pleasant stream i thus replied in the great city i was bred and grew and wear the body i have ever worn but who are ye from whom such mighty grief as now i witness courseth down your cheeks what torment breaks forth in this bitter woe our bonnets gleaming bright with orange hue one of them answerd are so leaden gross that with their weight they make the balances to crack beneath them joyous friars we were bolognas natives catalano i he loderingo namd and by thy land together taken as men used to take a single and indifferent arbiter to reconcile their strifes how there we sped gardingos vicinage can best declare o friars i began your miseries but there brake off for one had caught my eye fixd to a cross with three stakes on the ground he when he saw me writhd himself throughout distorted ruffling with deep sighs his beard and catalano who thereof was ware thus spake that pierced spirit whom intent thou viewst was he who gave the pharisees counsel that it were fitting for one man to suffer for the people he doth lie transverse nor any passes but him first behoves make feeling trial how each weighs in straits like this along the foss are placd the father of his consort and the rest partakers in that council seed of ill and sorrow to the jews i noted then how virgil gazd with wonder upon him thus abjectly extended on the cross in banishment eternal to the friar he next his words addressd we pray ye tell if so be lawful whether on our right lies any opening in the rock whereby we both may issue hence without constraint on the dark angels that compelld they come to lead us from this depth he thus replied nearer than thou dost hope there is a rock from the next circle moving which oersteps each vale of horror save that here his cope is shatterd by the ruin ye may mount for on the side it slants and most the height rises below with head bent down awhile my leader stood then spake he warnd us ill who yonder hangs the sinners on his hook to whom the friar at bologna erst i many vices of the devil heard among the rest was said he is a liar and the father of lies when he had spoke my leader with large strides proceeded on somewhat disturbd with anger in his look i therefore left the spirits heavy laden and following his beloved footsteps markd canto xxiv in the years early nonage when the sun tempers his tresses in aquarius urn and now towards equal day the nights recede when as the rime upon the earth puts on her dazzling sisters image but not long her milder sway endures then riseth up the village hind whom fails his wintry store and looking out beholds the plain around all whitend whence impatiently he smites his thighs and to his hut returning in there paces to and fro wailing his lot as a discomfited and helpless man then comes he forth again and feels new hope spring in his bosom finding een thus soon the world hath changd its countnance grasps his crook and forth to pasture drives his little flock so me my guide disheartend when i saw his troubled forehead and so speedily that ill was curd for at the fallen bridge arriving towards me with a look as sweet he turnd him back as that i first beheld at the steep mountains foot regarding well the ruin and some counsel first maintaind with his own thought he opend wide his arm and took me up as one who while he works computes his labours issue that he seems still to foresee the effect so lifting me up to the summit of one peak he fixd his eye upon another grapple that said he but first make proof if it be such as will sustain thee for one cappd with lead this were no journey scarcely he though light and i though onward pushd from crag to crag could mount and if the precinct of this coast were not less ample than the last for him i know not but my strength had surely faild but malebolge all toward the mouth inclining of the nethermost abyss the site of every valley hence requires that one side upward slope the other fall at length the point of our descent we reachd from the last flag soon as to that arrivd so was the breath exhausted from my lungs i could no further but did seat me there now needs thy best of man so spake my guide for not on downy plumes nor under shade of canopy reposing fame is won without which whosoeer consumes his days leaveth such vestige of himself on earth as smoke in air or foam upon the wave thou therefore rise vanish thy weariness by the minds effort in each struggle formd to vanquish if she suffer not the weight of her corporeal frame to crush her down a longer ladder yet remains to scale from these to have escapd sufficeth not if well thou note me profit by my words i straightway rose and showd myself less spent than i in truth did feel me on i cried for i am stout and fearless up the rock our way we held more rugged than before narrower and steeper far to climb from talk i ceasd not as we journeyd so to seem least faint whereat a voice from the other foss did issue forth for uttrance suited ill though on the arch that crosses there i stood what were the words i knew not but who spake seemd movd in anger down i stoopd to look but my quick eye might reach not to the depth for shrouding darkness wherefore thus i spake to the next circle teacher bend thy steps and from the wall dismount we for as hence i hear and understand not so i see beneath and naught discerni answer not said he but by the deed to fair request silent performance maketh best return we from the bridges head descended where to the eighth mound it joins and then the chasm opening to view i saw a crowd within of serpents terrible so strange of shape and hideous that remembrance in my veins yet shrinks the vital current of her sands let lybia vaunt no more if jaculus pareas and chelyder be her brood cenchris and amphisboena plagues so dire or in such numbers swarming neer she shewd not with all ethiopia and whateer above the erythraean sea is spawnd amid this dread exuberance of woe ran naked spirits wingd with horrid fear nor hope had they of crevice where to hide or heliotrope to charm them out of view with serpents were their hands behind them bound which through their reins infixd the tail and head twisted in folds before and lo on one near to our side darted an adder up and where the neck is on the shoulders tied transpiercd him far more quickly than eer pen wrote o or i he kindled burnd and changd to ashes all pourd out upon the earth when there dissolvd he lay the dust again uprolld spontaneous and the selfsame form instant resumed so mighty sages tell the arabian phoenix when five hundred years have well nigh circled dies and springs forthwith renascent blade nor herb throughout his life he tastes but tears of frankincense alone and odorous amomum swaths of nard and myrrh his funeral shroud as one that falls he knows not how by force demoniac draggd to earth or through obstruction fettering up in chains invisible the powers of man who risen from his trance gazeth around bewilderd with the monstrous agony he hath endurd and wildly staring sighs so stood aghast the sinner when he rose oh how severe gods judgment that deals out such blows in stormy vengeance who he was my teacher next inquird and thus in few he answerd vanni fucci am i calld not long since rained down from tuscany to this dire gullet me the beastial life and not the human pleasd mule that i was who in pistoia found my worthy den i then to virgil bid him stir not hence and ask what crime did thrust him hither once a man i knew him choleric and bloody the sinner heard and feignd not but towards me his mind directing and his face wherein was dismal shame depicturd thus he spake it grieves me more to have been caught by thee in this sad plight which thou beholdest than when i was taken from the other life i have no power permitted to deny what thou inquirest i am doomd thus low to dwell for that the sacristy by me was rifled of its goodly ornaments and with the guilt another falsely charged but that thou mayst not joy to see me thus so as thou eer shalt scape this darksome realm open thine ears and hear what i forebode reft of the neri first pistoia pines then florence changeth citizens and laws from valdimagra drawn by wrathful mars a vapour rises wrapt in turbid mists and sharp and eager driveth on the storm with arrowy hurtling oer picenos field whence suddenly the cloud shall burst and strike each helpless bianco prostrate to the ground this have i told that grief may rend thy heart canto xxv when he had spoke the sinner raisd his hands pointed in mockery and cried take them god i level them at thee from that day forth the serpents were my friends for round his neck one of then rolling twisted as it said be silent tongue another to his arms upgliding tied them riveting itself so close it took from them the power to move pistoia ah pistoia why dost doubt to turn thee into ashes cumbring earth no longer since in evil act so far thou hast outdone thy seed i did not mark through all the gloomy circles of the abyss spirit that swelld so proudly gainst his god not him who headlong fell from thebes he fled nor utterd more and after him there came a centaur full of fury shouting where where is the caitiff on maremmas marsh swarm not the serpent tribe as on his haunch they swarmd to where the human face begins behind his head upon the shoulders lay with open wings a dragon breathing fire on whomsoeer he met to me my guide cacus is this who underneath the rock of aventine spread oft a lake of blood he from his brethren parted here must tread a different journey for his fraudful theft of the great herd that near him stalld whence found his felon deeds their end beneath the mace of stout alcides that perchance laid on a hundred blows and not the tenth was felt while yet he spake the centaur sped away and under us three spirits came of whom nor i nor he was ware till they exclaimd say who are ye we then brake off discourse intent on these alone i knew them not but as it chanceth oft befell that one had need to name another where said he doth cianfa lurk i for a sign my guide should stand attentive placd against my lips the finger lifted if o reader now thou be not apt to credit what i tell no marvel for myself do scarce allow the witness of mine eyes but as i looked toward them lo a serpent with six feet springs forth on one and fastens full upon him his midmost graspd the belly a forefoot seizd on each arm while deep in either cheek he fleshd his fangs the hinder on the thighs were spread twixt which the tail inserted curld upon the reins behind ivy neer claspd a dodderd oak as round the others limbs the hideous monster intertwind his own then as they both had been of burning wax each melted into other mingling hues that which was either now was seen no more thus up the shrinking paper ere it burns a brown tint glides not turning yet to black and the clean white expires the other two lookd on exclaiming ah how dost thou change agnello see thou art nor double now nor only one the two heads now became one and two figures blended in one form appeard where both were lost of the four lengths two arms were made the belly and the chest the thighs and legs into such members changd as never eye hath seen of former shape all trace was vanishd two yet neither seemd that image miscreate and so passd on with tardy steps as underneath the scourge of the fierce dogstar that lays bare the fields shifting from brake to brake the lizard seems a flash of lightning if he thwart the road so toward th entrails of the other two approaching seemd an adder all on fire as the dark peppergrain livid and swart in that part whence our life is nourishd first one he transpiercd then down before him fell stretchd out the pierced spirit lookd on him but spake not yea stood motionless and yawnd as if by sleep or fevrous fit assaild he eyd the serpent and the serpent him one from the wound the other from the mouth breathd a thick smoke whose vapry columns joind lucan in mute attention now may hear nor thy disastrous fate sabellus tell nor shine nasidius ovid now be mute what if in warbling fiction he record cadmus and arethusa to a snake him changd and her into a fountain clear i envy not for never face to face two natures thus transmuted did he sing wherein both shapes were ready to assume the others substance they in mutual guise so answerd that the serpent split his train divided to a fork and the piercd spirit drew close his steps together legs and thighs compacted that no sign of juncture soon was visible the tail disparted took the figure which the spirit lost its skin softning his indurated to a rind the shoulders next i markd that entring joind the monsters armpits whose two shorter feet so lengthend as the others dwindling shrunk the feet behind then twisting up became that part that man conceals which in the wretch was cleft in twain while both the shadowy smoke with a new colour veils and generates th excrescent pile on one peeling it off from th other body lo upon his feet one upright rose and prone the other fell not yet their glaring and malignant lamps were shifted though each feature changd beneath of him who stood erect the mounting face retreated towards the temples and what there superfluous matter came shot out in ears from the smooth cheeks the rest not backward draggd of its excess did shape the nose and swelld into due size protuberant the lips he on the earth who lay meanwhile extends his sharpend visage and draws down the ears into the head as doth the slug his horns his tongue continuous before and apt for uttrance severs and the others fork closing unites that done the smoke was laid the soul transformd into the brute glides off hissing along the vale and after him the other talking sputters but soon turnd his newgrown shoulders on him and in few thus to another spake along this path crawling as i have done speed buoso now so saw i fluctuate in successive change th unsteady ballast of the seventh hold and here if aught my tongue have swervd events so strange may be its warrant oer mine eyes confusion hung and on my thoughts amaze yet scapd they not so covertly but well i markd sciancato he alone it was of the three first that came who changd not thou the others fate gaville still dost rue canto xxvi florence exult for thou so mightily hast thriven that oer land and sea thy wings thou beatest and thy name spreads over hell among the plundrers such the three i found thy citizens whence shame to me thy son and no proud honour to thyself redounds but if our minds when dreaming near the dawn are of the truth presageful thou ere long shalt feel what prato not to say the rest would fain might come upon thee and that chance were in good time if it befell thee now would so it were since it must needs befall for as time wears me i shall grieve the more we from the depth departed and my guide remounting scald the flinty steps which late we downward tracd and drew me up the steep pursuing thus our solitary way among the crags and splinters of the rock sped not our feet without the help of hands then sorrow seizd me which een now revives as my thought turns again to what i saw and more than i am wont i rein and curb the powers of nature in me lest they run where virtue guides not that if aught of good my gentle star or something better gave me i envy not myself the precious boon as in that season when the sun least veils his face that lightens all what time the fly gives way to the shrill gnat the peasant then upon some cliff reclind beneath him sees fireflies innumerous spangling oer the vale vineyard or tilth where his daylabour lies with flames so numberless throughout its space shone the eighth chasm apparent when the depth was to my view exposd as he whose wrongs the bears avengd at its departure saw elijahs chariot when the steeds erect raisd their steep flight for heavn his eyes meanwhile straining pursud them till the flame alone upsoaring like a misty speck he kennd een thus along the gulf moves every flame a sinner so enfolded close in each that none exhibits token of the theft upon the bridge i forward bent to look and graspd a flinty mass or else had falln though pushd not from the height the guide who markd how i did gaze attentive thus began within these ardours are the spirits each swathd in confining firemaster thy word i answerd hath assurd me yet i deemd already of the truth already wishd to ask thee who is in yon fire that comes so parted at the summit as it seemd ascending from that funeral pile where lay the theban brothers he replied within ulysses there and diomede endure their penal tortures thus to vengeance now together hasting as erewhile to wrath these in the flame with ceaseless groans deplore the ambush of the horse that opend wide a portal for that goodly seed to pass which sowd imperial rome nor less the guile lament they whence of her achilles reft deidamia yet in death complains and there is rued the stratagem that troy of her palladium spoildif they have power of uttrance from within these sparks said i o master think my prayer a thousand fold in repetition urgd that thou vouchsafe to pause till here the horned flame arrive see how toward it with desire i bend he thus thy prayer is worthy of much praise and i accept it therefore but do thou thy tongue refrain to question them be mine for i divine thy wish and they perchance for they were greeks might shun discourse with thee when there the flame had come where time and place seemd fitting to my guide he thus began o ye who dwell two spirits in one fire if living i of you did merit aught whateer the measure were of that desert when in the world my lofty strain i pourd move ye not on till one of you unfold in what clime death oertook him selfdestroyd of the old flame forthwith the greater horn began to roll murmuring as a fire that labours with the wind then to and fro wagging the top as a tongue uttering sounds threw out its voice and spake when i escapd from circe who beyond a circling year had held me near caieta by her charms ere thus aeneas yet had namd the shore nor fondness for my son nor reverence of my old father nor return of love that should have crownd penelope with joy could overcome in me the zeal i had t explore the world and search the ways of life mans evil and his virtue forth i saild into the deep illimitable main with but one bark and the small faithful band that yet cleavd to me as iberia far

tribe whence heaping woe on woe he hurried off as one griefstung to madness but i there still lingerd to behold the troop and saw things such as i may fear without more proof to tell of but that conscience makes me firm the boon companion who her strong breastplate buckles on him that feels no guilt within and bids him on and fear not without doubt i saw and yet it seems to pass before me a headless trunk that even as the rest of the sad flock pacd onward by the hair it bore the severd member lanternwise pendent in hand which lookd at us and said woes me the spirit lighted thus himself

the rock first showd the other valley had more light been there een to the lowest depth soon as we came oer the last cloister in the dismal rounds of malebolge and the brotherhood were to our view

allsearching justice dooms to punishment the forgers noted on her dread record more rueful was it not methinks to see the nation in aegina droop what time each living thing een to the little worm all

neer abated pruriency the crust came drawn from underneath in flakes like scales scrapd from the bream or fish of broader mail o thou who with thy fingers rendest off thy coat of proof thus spake my guide to one and sometimes makest tearing pincers of them tell me if any born of latian land be among these within so may thy nails serve thee for everlasting to this toil both are of latium weeping he replied whom torturd thus thou seest but who art thou that hast inquird of us to whom my guide one that descend with this man who yet lives from rock to rock and show him hells abyss then started

it back to view the other cursed spirits one i saw in fashion like a lute had but the groin been severd where it meets the forked part swoln dropsy disproportioning the limbs with illconverted moisture that the paunch suits not the visage opend wide his lips gasping as in the hectic man for drought one towards the chin the other upward curld o ye who in this world of misery wherefore i know not are exempt from pain thus he began attentively regard adamos woe when living full supply neer lackd me of what most i coveted one drop of water now alas i crave the rills that glitter down the grassy slopes of casentino making fresh and soft the banks whereby they glide to arnos stream stand ever in my view and not in vain for more the picturd semblance dries me up much more than the disease which makes the flesh desert these shriveld cheeks so from the place where i transgressd stern justice urging me takes means to quicken more my labring sighs there is romena where i falsified the metal with the baptists form imprest for which on earth i left my body burnt but if i here might see the sorrowing soul of guido alessandro or their brother for brandas limpid spring i would not change the welcome sight one is een now within if truly the mad spirits tell that round are wandring but wherein besteads me that my limbs are fetterd were i but so light that i each hundred years might move one inch i had set forth already on this path seeking him out amidst the shapeless crew although eleven miles it wind not more than half of one across they brought me down among this tribe inducd by them i stampd the florens with three carats of alloy who are that abject pair i next inquird that closely bounding thee upon thy right lie smoking like a band in winter steepd in the chill streamwhen to this gulf i dropt he answerd here i found them since that hour they have not turnd nor ever shall i ween till time hath run his course one is that dame the false accuser of the hebrew

him on the braced paunch that like a drum resounded but forthwith adamo smote him on the face the blow returning with his arm that seemd as hard though my oerweighty limbs have taen from me the power

the dropsied ay now speakst thou true but there thou gavst not such true testimony when thou wast questiond of the truth at troy if i spake false thou falsely stampdst the coin said sinon i am here but for one fault and thou for more than any imp beside remember he replied o perjurd one the horse remember that did teem with death and all the world be witness to thy guilt to thine returnd the greek witness the thirst whence thy tongue cracks witness the fluid mound reard by thy belly up before thine eyes a mass corrupt to whom the coiner thus thy mouth gapes wide as ever to let pass its evil saying me if thirst assails yet i am stuffd with moisture thou art parchd pains rack thy head no urging wouldst thou need to make thee lap narcissus mirror up i was all fixd to listen when my guide admonishd now beware a little more and i do quarrel with thee i perceivd how angrily he spake and towards him turnd with shame so poignant as rememberd yet confounds me as a man that dreams of harm befalln him dreaming wishes it a dream and that which is desires as if it were not such then was i who wanting power to speak wishd to excuse myself and all the while excusd me though unweeting that i did more grievous fault than thine has been less shame my master cried might expiate therefore cast all sorrow from thy soul and if again chance bring thee where like conference is held think i am ever at thy side to hear such wrangling is a joy for vulgar minds canto xxxi the very tongue whose keen reproof before had wounded me that either cheek was staind now ministerd my cure so have i heard achilles and his fathers javelin causd pain first and then the boon of health restord turning our back upon the vale of woe w crossd th encircled mound in silence there was twilight dim that far long the gloom mine eye advancd not but i heard a horn sounded aloud the peal it blew had made the thunder feeble following its course the adverse way my strained eyes were bent on that one spot so terrible a blast orlando blew not when that dismal rout oerthrew the host of charlemagne and quenchd his saintly warfare thitherward not long my head was raisd when many lofty towers methought i spied master said i what land is this he answerd straight too long a space of intervening darkness has thine eye to traverse thou hast therefore widely errd in thy imagining thither arrivd thou well shalt see how distance can delude the sense a little therefore urge thee on then tenderly he caught me by the hand yet know said he ere farther we advance that it less strange may seem these are not towers but giants in the pit they stand immersd each from his navel downward round the bank as when a fog disperseth gradually our vision traces what the mist involves condensd in air so piercing through the gross and gloomy atmosphere as more and more we neard toward the brink mine error fled and fear came oer me as with circling round of turrets montereggion crowns his walls een thus the shore encompassing th abyss was turreted with giants half their length uprearing horrible whom jove from heavn yet threatens when his muttring thunder rolls of one already i descried the face shoulders and breast and of the belly huge great part and both arms down along his ribs allteeming nature when her plastic hand left framing of these monsters did display past doubt her wisdom taking from mad war such slaves to do his bidding and if she repent her not of th elephant and whale who ponders well confesses her therein wiser and more discreet for when brute force and evil will are backd with subtlety resistance none avails his visage seemd in length and bulk as doth the pine that tops saint peters roman fane and th other bones of like proportion so that from above the bank which girdled him below such height arose his stature that three friezelanders had strivn in vain to reach but to his hair full thirty ample palms was he exposd downward from whence a man his garments loops raphel bai ameth sabi almi so shouted his fierce lips which sweeter hymns became not and my guide addressd him thus o senseless spirit let thy horn for thee interpret therewith vent thy rage if rage or other passion wring thee search thy neck there shalt thou find the belt that binds it on wild spirit lo upon thy mighty breast where hangs the baldrick then to me he spake he doth accuse himself nimrod is this through whose ill counsel in the world no more one tongue prevails but pass we on nor waste our words for so each language is to him as his to others understood by none then to the leftward turning sped we forth and at a slings throw found another shade far fiercer and more huge i cannot say what master hand had girt him but he held behind the right arm fetterd and before the other with a chain that fastend him from the neck down and five times round his form apparent met the wreathed links this proud one would of his strength against almighty jove make trial said my guide whence he is thus requited ephialtes him they call great was his prowess when the giants brought fear on the gods those arms which then he piled now moves he never forthwith i returnd fain would i if t were possible mine eyes of briareus immeasurable gaind experience next he answerd thou shalt see not far from hence antaeus who both speaks and is unfetterd who shall place us there where guilt is at its depth far onward stands whom thou wouldst fain behold in chains and made like to this spirit save that in his looks more fell he seems by violent earthquake rockd neer shook a towr so reeling to its base as ephialtes more than ever then i dreaded death nor than the terror more had needed if i had not seen the cords that held him fast we straightway journeying on came to antaeus who five ells complete without the head forth issued from the cave o thou who in the fortunate vale that made great scipio heir of glory when his sword drove back the troop of hannibal in flight who thence of old didst carry for thy spoil an hundred lions and if thou hadst fought in the high conflict on thy brethrens side seems as men yet believd that through thine arm the sons of earth had conquerd now vouchsafe to place us down beneath where numbing cold locks up cocytus force not that we crave or tityus help or typhons here is one can give what in this realm ye covet stoop therefore nor scornfully distort thy lip he in the upper world can yet bestow renown on thee for he doth live and looks for life yet longer if before the time grace call him not unto herself thus spake the teacher he in haste forth stretchd his hands and caught my guide alcides whilom felt that grapple straightend score soon as my guide had felt it he bespake me thus this way that i may clasp thee then so caught me up that we were both one burden as appears the tower of carisenda from beneath where it doth lean if chance a passing cloud so sail across that opposite it hangs such then antaeus seemd as at mine ease i markd him stooping i were fain at times t have passd another way yet in th abyss that lucifer with judas low ingulfs lightly he placd us nor there leaning stayd but rose as in a bark the stately mast canto xxxii could i command rough rhimes and hoarse to suit that hole of sorrow oer which evry rock his firm abutment rears then might the vein of fancy rise full springing but not mine such measures and with faltring awe i touch the mighty theme for to describe the depth of all the universe is no emprize to jest with and demands a tongue not usd to infant babbling but let them assist my song the tuneful maidens by whose aid amphion walld in thebes so with the truth my speech shall best accord oh illstarrd folk beyond all others wretched who abide in such a mansion as scarce thought finds words to speak of better had ye here on earth been flocks or mountain goats as down we stood in the dark pit beneath the giants feet but lower far than they and i did gaze still on the lofty battlement a voice bespoke me thus look how thou walkest take good heed thy soles do tread not on the heads of thy poor brethren thereupon i turnd and saw before and underneath my feet a lake whose frozen surface liker seemd to glass than water not so thick a veil in winter eer hath austrian danube spread oer his still course nor tanais far remote under the chilling sky rolld oer that mass had tabernich or pietrapana falln not een its rim had creakd as peeps the frog croaking above the wave what time in dreams the village gleaner oft pursues her toil so to where modest shame appears thus low blue pinchd and shrind in ice the spirits stood moving their teeth in shrill note like the stork his face each downward held their mouth the cold their eyes expressd the dolour of their heart a space i lookd around then at my feet saw two so strictly joind that of their head the very hairs were mingled tell me ye whose bosoms thus together press said i who are ye at that sound their necks they bent and when their looks were lifted up to me straightway their eyes before all moist within distilld upon their lips and the frost bound the tears betwixt those orbs and held them there plank

camiccione i await carlino here my kinsman whose deep guilt shall wash out mine a thousand visages then markd i which the keen and eager cold had shapd into a doggish grin whence creeps a shivring horror oer me at the thought of those frore shallows while we journeyd on toward the middle at whose point unites all heavy substance and i trembling went through that eternal chillness i know not if will it were or destiny or chance but passing midst the heads my foot did strike with violent blow against the face of one wherefore dost bruise me weeping he exclaimd unless thy errand be some fresh revenge for montaperto wherefore troublest me i thus instructor now await me here that i through him may rid me of my doubt thenceforth what haste thou wilt the teacher pausd and to that shade i spake who bitterly still cursd me in his wrath what art thou speak that railest thus on others he replied now who art thou that smiting others cheeks through antenora roamest with such force as were past suffrance wert thou living still and i am living to thy joy perchance was my reply if fame be dear to thee that with the rest i may thy name enrol the contrary of what i covet most said he thou tenderst hence nor vex me more ill knowest thou to flatter in this vale then seizing on his hinder scalp i cried name thee or not a hair shall tarry here rend all away he answerd yet for that i will not tell nor show thee who i am though at my head thou pluck a thousand times now i had graspd his tresses and stript off more than one tuft he barking with his eyes drawn in and downward when another cried what ails thee bocca sound not loud enough thy chattring teeth but thou must bark outright what devil wrings theenow said i be dumb accursed traitor to thy shame of thee true tidings will i

before him rangd lanfranchi with sismondi and gualandi after short course the father and the sons seemd tird and lagging and methought i saw the sharp tusks gore their sides when i awoke before the dawn amid their sleep i heard my sons for they were with me weep and ask for bread right cruel art thou if no pang thou feel at thinking what my heart foretold and if not now why use thy tears to flow now had they wakend and the hour drew near when they were wont to bring us food the mind of each misgave him through his dream and i heard at its outlet underneath lockd up the horrible tower whence uttering not a word i lookd upon the visage of my sons i wept not so all stone i felt within they wept and one my little anslem cried thou lookest so father what ails thee yet i shed no tear nor answerd all that day nor the next night until another sun came out upon the world when a faint beam had to our doleful prison made its way and in four countenances i descryd the image of my own on either hand through agony i bit and they who thought i did it through desire of feeding rose o th sudden and cried father we should grieve far less if thou wouldst eat of us thou gavst these weeds of miserable flesh we wear and do thou strip them off from us again then not to make them sadder i kept down my spirit in stillness that day and the next we all were silent ah obdurate earth why opendst not upon us when we came to the fourth day then geddo at my feet outstretchd did fling him crying hast no help for me my father there he died and een plainly as thou seest me saw i the three fall one by one twixt the fifth day and sixth whence i betook me now grown blind to grope over them all and for three days aloud calld on them who were dead then fasting got the mastery of grief thus having spoke once more upon the wretched skull his teeth he fastend like a mastiffs gainst the bone firm and unyielding oh thou pisa shame of all the people who their dwelling make in that fair region where th italian voice is heard since that thy neighbours are so slack to punish from their deep foundations rise capraia and gorgona and dam up the mouth of arno that each soul in thee may perish in the waters what if fame reported that thy castles were betrayd by ugolino yet no right hadst thou to stretch his children on the rack for them brigata ugaccione and the pair of gentle ones of whom my song hath told their tender years thou modern thebes did make uncapable of guilt onward we passd where others skarfd in rugged folds of ice not on their feet were turnd but each reversd there very weeping suffers not to weep for at their eyes grief seeking passage finds impediment and rolling inward turns for increase of sharp anguish the first tears hang clusterd and like crystal vizors show under the socket brimming all the cup now though the cold had from my face dislodgd each feeling as t were callous yet me seemd some breath of wind i felt whence cometh this said i my master is not here below all vapour quenchdthou shalt be speedily he answerd where thine eye shall tell thee whence the cause descrying of this airy shower then cried out one in the chill crust who mournd o souls so cruel that the farthest post hath been assignd you from this face remove the hardend veil that i may vent the grief impregnate at my heart some little space ere it congeal again i thus replied say who thou wast if thou wouldst have mine aid and if i extricate thee not far down as to the lowest ice may i descend the friar alberigo answered he am i who from the evil garden pluckd its fruitage and am here repaid the date more luscious for my fighah i exclaimd art thou too deadhow in the world aloft it fareth with my body answerd he i am right ignorant such privilege hath ptolomea that ofttimes the soul drops hither ere by atropos divorcd and that thou mayst wipe out more willingly the glazed teardrops that oerlay mine eyes know that the soul that moment she betrays as i did yields her body to a fiend who after moves and governs it at will till all its time be rounded headlong she falls to this cistern and perchance above doth yet appear the body of a ghost who here behind me winters him thou knowst if thou but newly art arrivd below the years are many that have passd away since to this fastness branca doria came now answerd i methinks thou mockest me for branca doria never yet hath died but doth all natural functions of a man eats drinks and sleeps and putteth raiment on he thus not yet unto that upper foss by th evil talons guarded where the pitch tenacious boils had michael zanche reachd when this one left a demon in his stead in his own body and of one his kin who with him treachery wrought but now put forth thy hand and ope mine eyes i opd them not ill manners were best courtesy to him ah genoese men perverse in every way with every foulness staind why from the earth are ye not canceld such an one of yours i with romagnas darkest spirit found as for his doings even now in soul is in cocytus plungd and yet doth seem in body still alive upon the earth canto xxxiv the banners of hells monarch do come forth towards us therefore look so spake my guide if thou discern him as when breathes a cloud heavy and dense or when the shades of night fall on our hemisphere seems viewd from far a windmill which the blast stirs briskly round such was the fabric then methought i saw to shield me from the wind forthwith i drew behind my guide no covert else was there now came i and with fear i bid my strain record the marvel where the souls were all whelmd underneath transparent as through glass pellucid the frail stem some prone were laid others stood upright this upon the soles that on his head a third with face to feet archd like a bow when to the point we came whereat my guide was pleasd that i should see the creature eminent in beauty once he from before me steppd and made me pause lo he exclaimd lo dis and lo the place where thou hast need to arm thy heart with strength how frozen and how faint i then became ask me not reader for i write it not since words would fail to tell thee of my state i was not dead nor living think thyself if quick conception work in thee at all how i did feel that emperor who sways the realm of sorrow at mid breast from th ice stood forth and i in stature am more like a giant than the giants are in his arms mark now how great that whole must be which suits with such a part if he were beautiful as he is hideous now and yet did dare to scowl upon his maker well from him may all our misry flow oh what a sight how passing strange it seemd when i did spy upon his head three faces one in front of hue vermilion th other two with this midway each shoulder joind and at the crest the right twixt wan and yellow seemd the left to look on such as come from whence old nile stoops to the lowlands under each shot forth two mighty wings enormous as became a bird so vast sails never such i saw outstretchd on the wide sea no plumes had they but were in texture like a bat and these he flappd i th air that from him issued still three winds wherewith cocytus to its depth was frozen at six eyes he wept the tears adown three chins distilld with bloody foam at every mouth his teeth a sinner champd bruisd as with pondrous engine so that three were in this guise tormented but far more than from that gnawing was the foremost pangd by the fierce rending whence ofttimes the back was stript of all its skin that upper spirit who hath worse punishment so spake my guide is judas he that hath his head within and plies the feet without of th other two whose heads are under from the murky jaw who hangs is brutus lo how he doth writhe and speaks not th other cassius that appears so large of limb but night now reascends and it is time for parting all is seen i clippd him round the neck for so he bade and noting time and place he when the wings enough were opd caught fast the shaggy sides and down from pile to pile descending steppd between the thick fell and the jagged ice soon as he reachd the point whereat the thigh upon the swelling of the haunches turns my leader there with pain and struggling hard turnd round his head where his feet stood before and grappled at the fell as one who mounts that into hell methought we turnd again expect that by such stairs as these thus spake the teacher panting like a man forespent we must depart from evil so extreme then at a rocky opening issued forth and placd me on a brink to sit next joind with wary step my side i raisd mine eyes believing that i lucifer should see where he was lately left but saw him now with legs held upward let the grosser sort who see not what the point was i had passd bethink them if sore toil oppressd me then arise my master cried upon thy feet the way is long and much uncouth the road and now within one hour and half of noon the sun returns it was no palacehall lofty and luminous wherein we stood but natural dungeon where ill footing was and scant supply of light ere from th abyss i seprate thus when risen i began my guide vouchsafe few words to set me free from errors thralldom where is now the ice how standeth he in posture thus reversd and how from eve to morn in space so brief hath the sun made his transit he in few thus answering spake thou deemest thou art still on th other side the centre where i graspd th abhorred worm that boreth through the world thou wast on th other side so long as i descended when i turnd thou didst oerpass that point to which from evry part is draggd all heavy substance thou art now arrivd under the hemisphere opposed to that which the great continent doth overspread and underneath whose canopy expird the man that was born sinless and so livd thy feet are planted on the smallest sphere whose other aspect is judecca morn here rises when there evening sets and he whose shaggy pile was scald yet standeth fixd as at the first on this part he fell down from heavn and th earth here prominent before through fear of him did veil her with the sea and to our hemisphere retird perchance to shun him was the vacant space left here by what of firm land on this side appears that sprang aloof there is a place beneath from belzebub as distant as extends the vaulted tomb discoverd not by sight but by the sound of brooklet that descends this way along the hollow of a rock which as it winds with no precipitous course the wave hath eaten by that hidden way my guide and i did enter to return to the fair world and heedless of repose we climbed he first i following his steps till on our view the beautiful lights of heavn dawnd through a circular opening in the cave thus issuing we again beheld the stars purgatory canto i oer better waves to speed her rapid course the light bark of my genius lifts the sail well pleasd to leave so cruel sea behind and of that second region will i sing in which the human spirit from sinful blot is purgd and for ascent to heaven prepares here o ye hallowd nine for in your train i follow here the deadened strain revive nor let calliope refuse to sound a somewhat higher song of that loud tone which when the wretched birds of chattering note had heard they of forgiveness lost all hope sweet hue of eastern sapphire that was spread oer the serene aspect of the pure air high up as the first circle to mine eyes unwonted joy renewd soon as i scapd forth from the atmosphere of deadly gloom that had mine eyes and bosom filld with grief the radiant planet that to love invites made all the orient laugh and veild beneath the pisces light that in his escort came to the right hand i turnd and fixd my mind on the other pole attentive where i saw four stars neer seen before save by the ken of our first parents heaven of their rays seemd joyous o thou northern site bereft indeed and widowd since of these deprivd as from this view i had desisted straight turning a little towrds the other pole there from whence now the wain had disappeard i saw an old man standing by my side alone so worthy of revrence in his look that neer from son to father more was owd low down his beard and mixd with hoary white descended like his locks which parting fell upon his breast in double fold the beams of those four luminaries on his face so brightly shone and with such radiance clear deckd it that i beheld him as the sun say who are ye that stemming the blind stream forth from th eternal prisonhouse have fled he spoke and moved those venerable plumes who hath conducted or with lantern sure lights you emerging from the depth of night that makes the infernal valley ever black are the firm statutes of the dread abyss broken or in high heaven new laws ordaind that thus condemnd ye to my caves approach my guide then laying hold on me by words and intimations given with hand and head made my bent knees and eye submissive pay due reverence then thus to him replied not of myself i come a dame from heaven descending had besought me in my charge to bring but since thy will implies that more our true condition i unfold at large mine is not to deny thee thy request this mortal neer hath seen the farthest gloom but erring by his folly had approachd so near that little space was left to turn then as before i told i was dispatchd to work his rescue and no way remaind save this which i have taen i have displayd before him all the regions of the bad and purpose now those spirits to display that under thy command are purgd from sin how i have brought him would be long to say from high descends the virtue by whose aid i to thy sight and hearing him have led now may our coming please thee in the search of liberty he journeys that how dear they know who for her sake have life refusd thou knowest to whom death for her was sweet in utica where thou didst leave those weeds that in the last great day will shine so bright for us the eternal edicts are unmovd he breathes and i am free of minos power abiding in that circle where the eyes of thy chaste marcia beam who still in look prays thee o hallowd spirit to own her shine then by her love we implore thee let us pass through thy sevn regions for which best thanks i for thy favour will to her return if mention there below thou not disdain marcia so pleasing in my sight was found he then to him rejoind while i was there that all she askd me i was fain to grant now that beyond the accursed stream she dwells she may no longer move me by that law which was ordaind me when i issued thence not so if dame from heaven as thou sayst moves and directs thee then no flattery needs enough for me that in her name thou ask go therefore now and with a slender reed see that thou duly gird him and his face lave till all sordid stain thou wipe from thence for not with eye by any cloud obscurd would it be seemly before him to come who stands the foremost minister in heaven this islet all around there far beneath where the wave beats it on the oozy bed produces store of reeds no other plant coverd with leaves or hardend in its stalk there lives not bending to the waters sway after this way return not but the sun will show you that now rises where to take the mountain in its easiest ascent he disappeard and i myself upraisd speechless and to my guide retiring close toward him turnd mine eyes he thus began my son observant thou my steps pursue we must retreat to rearward for that way the champain to its low extreme declines the dawn had chasd the matin hour of prime which deaf before it so that from afar i spyd the trembling of the ocean stream we traversd the deserted plain as one who wanderd from his track thinks every step trodden in vain till he regain the path when we had come where yet the tender dew strove with the sun and in a place where fresh the wind breathd oer it while it slowly dried both hands extended on the watery grass my master placd in graceful act and kind whence i of his intent before apprizd stretchd out to him my cheeks suffusd with tears there to my visage he anew restord that hue which the dun shades of hell conceald then on the solitary shore arrivd that never sailing on its waters saw man that could after measure back his course he girt me in such manner as had pleasd him who instructed and o strange to tell as he selected every humble plant wherever one was pluckd another there resembling straightway in its place arose canto ii now had the sun to that horizon reachd that covers with the most exalted point of its meridian circle salems walls and night that opposite to him her orb sounds from the stream of ganges issued forth holding the scales that from her hands are droppd when she reigns highest so that where i was auroras white and vermeiltincturd cheek to orange turnd as she in age increasd meanwhile we lingerd by the waters brink like men who musing on their road in thought journey while motionless the body rests when lo as near upon the hour of dawn through the thick vapours mars with fiery beam glares down in west over the ocean floor so seemd what once again i hope to view a light so swiftly coming through the sea no winged course might equal its career from which when for a space i had withdrawn thine eyes to make inquiry of my guide again i lookd and saw it grown in size and brightness thou on either side appeard something but what i knew not of bright hue and by degrees from underneath it came another my preceptor silent yet stood while the brightness that we first discernd opend the form of wings then when he knew the pilot cried aloud down down bend low thy knees behold gods angel fold thy hands now shalt thou see true ministers indeed lo how all human means he sets at naught so that nor oar he needs nor other sail except his wings between such distant shores lo how straight up to heaven he holds them reard winnowing the air with those eternal plumes that not like mortal hairs fall off or change as more and more toward us came more bright appeard the bird of god nor could the eye endure his splendor near i mine bent down he drove ashore in a small bark so swift and light that in its course no wave it drank the heavnly steersman at the prow was seen visibly written blessed in his looks within a hundred spirits and more there sat in exitu israel de aegypto all with one voice together sang with what in the remainder of that hymn is writ then soon as with the sign of holy cross he blessd them they at once leapd out on land the swiftly as he came returnd the crew there left appeard astounded with the place gazing around as one who sees new sights from every side the sun darted his beams and with his arrowy radiance from mid heavn had chasd the capricorn when that strange tribe lifting their eyes towards us if ye know declare what path will lead us to the mount them virgil answerd ye suppose perchance us well acquainted with this place but here we as yourselves are strangers not long erst we came before you but a little space by other road so rough and hard that now the ascent will seem to us as play the spirits who from my breathing had perceivd i livd grew pale with wonder as the multitude flock round a herald sent with olive branch to hear what news he brings and in their haste tread one another down een so at sight of me those happy spirits were fixd each one forgetful of its errand to depart where cleansd from sin it might be made all fair then one i saw darting before the rest with such fond ardour to embrace me i to do the like was movd o shadows vain except in outward semblance thrice my hands i claspd behind it they as oft returnd empty into my breast again surprise i needs must think was painted in my looks for that the shadow smild and backward drew to follow it i hastend but with voice of sweetness it enjoind me to desist then who it was i knew and prayd of it to talk with me it would a little pause it answered thee as in my mortal frame i lovd so loosd forth it i love thee still and therefore pause but why walkest thou here not without purpose once more to return thou findst me my casella where i am journeying this way i said but how of thee hath so much time been lost he answerd straight no outrage hath been done to me if he who when and whom he chooses takes me oft this passage hath denied since of just will his will he makes these three months past indeed he whose chose to enter with free leave hath taken whence i wandring by the shore where tybers wave grows salt of him gaind kind admittance at that rivers mouth towrd which his wings are pointed for there always throng all such as not to archeron descend then i if new laws have not quite destroyd memory and use of that sweet song of love that while all my cares had power to swage please thee with it a little to console my spirit that incumberd with its frame travelling so far of pain is overcome love that discourses in my thoughts he then began in such soft accents that within the sweetness thrills me yet my gentle guide and all who came with him so well were pleasd that seemd naught else might in their thoughts have room fast fixd in mute attention to his notes we stood when lo that old man venerable exclaiming how is this ye tardy spirits what negligence detains you loitring here run to the mountain to cast off those scales that from your eyes the sight of god conceal as a wild flock of pigeons to their food collected blade or tares without their pride accustomd and in still and quiet sort if aught alarm them suddenly desert their meal assaild by more important care so i that newcome troop beheld the song deserting hasten to the mountains side as one who goes yet where he tends knows not nor with less hurried step did we depart canto iii them sudden flight had scatterd over the plain turnd towrds the mountain whither reasons voice drives us i to my faithful company adhering left it not for how of him deprivd might i have sped or who beside would oer the mountainous tract have led my steps he with the bitter pang of selfremorse seemd smitten o clear conscience and upright how doth a little fling wound thee sore soon as his feet desisted slackning pace from haste that mars all decency of act my mind that in itself before was wrapt its thoughts expanded as with joy restord and full against the steep ascent i set my face where highest to heavn its top oerflows the sun that flard behind with ruddy beam before my form was broken for in me his rays resistance met i turnd aside with fear of being left when i beheld only before myself the ground obscurd when thus my solace turning him around bespake me kindly why distrustest thou believst not i am with thee thy sure guide it now is evening there where buried lies the body in which i cast a shade removd to naples from brundusiums wall nor thou marvel if before me no shadow fall more than that in the sky element one ray obstructs not other to endure torments of heat and cold extreme like frames that virtue hath disposd which how it works wills not to us should be reveald insane who hopes our reason may that space explore which holds three persons in one substance knit seek not the wherefore race of human kind could ye have seen the whole no need had been for mary to bring forth moreover ye have seen such men desiring fruitlessly to whose desires repose would have been givn that now but serve them for eternal grief i speak of plato and the stagyrite and others many more and then he bent downwards his forehead and in troubled mood broke off his speech meanwhile we had arrivd far as the mountains foot and there the rock found of so steep ascent that nimblest steps to climb it had been vain the most remote most wild untrodden path in all the tract twixt lerice and turbia were to this a ladder easy and open of access who knows on which hand now the steep declines my master said and pausd so that he may ascend who journeys without aid of wine and while with looks directed to the ground the meaning of the pathway he explord and i gazd upward round the stony height of spirits that toward us movd their steps yet moving seemd not they so slow approachd i thus my guide addressd upraise thine eyes lo that way some of whom thou mayst obtain counsel if of thyself thou findst it not straightway he lookd and with free speech replied let us tend thither they but softly come and thou be firm in hope my son belovd now was that people distant far in space a thousand paces behind ours as much as at a throw the nervous arm could fling when all drew backward on the messy crags of the steep bank and firmly stood unmovd as one who walks in doubt might stand to look o spirits perfect o already chosen virgil to them began by that blest peace which as i deem is for you all prepard instruct us where the mountain low declines so that attempt to mount it be not vain for who knows most him loss of time most grieves as sheep that step from forth their fold by one or pairs or three at once meanwhile the rest stand fearfully bending the eye and nose to ground and what the foremost does that do the others gathring round her if she stops simple and quiet nor the cause discern so saw i moving to advance the first who of that fortunate crew were at the head of modest mien and graceful in their gait when they before me had beheld the light from my right side fall broken on the ground so that the shadow reachd the cave they stoppd and somewhat back retird the same did all who followd though unweeting of the cause unaskd of you yet freely i confess this is a human body which ye see that the suns light is broken on the ground marvel not but believe that not without virtue derivd from heaven we to climb over this wall aspire so them bespake my master and that virtuous tribe rejoind turn and before you there the entrance lies making a signal to us with bent hands then of them one began whoeer thou art who journeyst thus this way thy visage turn think if me elsewhere thou hast ever seen i towrds him turnd and with fixd eye beheld comely and fair and gentle of aspect he seemd but on one brow a gash was markd when humbly i disclaimd to have beheld him ever now behold he said and showd high on his breast a wound then smiling spake i am manfredi grandson to the queen costanza whence i pray thee when returnd to my fair daughter go the parent glad of aragonia and sicilias pride and of the truth inform her if of me aught else be told when by two mortal blows my frame was shatterd i betook myself weeping to him who of free will forgives my sins were horrible but so wide arms hath goodness infinite that it receives all who turn to it had this text divine been of cosenzas shepherd better scannd who then by clement on my hunt was set yet at the bridges head my bones had lain near benevento by the heavy mole protected but the rain now drenches them and the wind drives out of the kingdoms bounds far as the stream of verde where with lights extinguishd he removd them from their bed yet by their curse we are not so destroyd but that the eternal love may turn while hope retains her verdant blossoms true it is that such one as in contumacy dies against the holy church though he repent must wander thirtyfold for all the time in his presumption past if such decree be not by prayers of good men shorter made look therefore if thou canst advance my bliss revealing to my good costanza how thou hast beheld me and beside the terms laid on me of that interdict for here by means of those below much profit comes canto iv when by sensations of delight or pain that any of our faculties hath seizd entire the soul collects herself it seems she is intent upon that power alone and thus the error is disprovd which holds the soul not singly lighted in the breast and therefore when as aught is heard or seen that firmly keeps the soul toward it turnd time passes and a man perceives it not for that whereby he hearken is one power another that which the whole spirit hash this is as it were bound while that is free this found i true by proof hearing that spirit and wondring for full fifty steps aloft the sun had measurd unobservd of me when we arrivd where all with one accord the spirits shouted here is what ye ask a larger aperture ofttimes is stoppd with forked stake of thorn by villager when the ripe grape imbrowns than was the path by which my guide and i behind him close ascended solitary when that troop departing left us on sanleos road who journeys or to noli low descends or mounts bismantuas height must use his feet but here a man had need to fly i mean with the swift wing and plumes of high desire conducted by his aid who gave me hope and with light furnishd to direct my way we through the broken rock ascended close pent on each side while underneath the ground askd help of hands and feet when we arrivd near on the highest ridge of the steep bank where the plain level opend i exclaimd o master say which way can we proceed he answerd let no step of thine recede behind me gain the mountain till to us some practisd guide appear that eminence was lofty that no eye might reach its point and the side proudly rising more than line from the mid quadrant to the centre drawn i wearied thus began parent belovd turn and behold how i remain alone if thou stay notmy son he straight replyd thus far put forth thy strength and to a track pointed that on this side projecting round circles the hill his words so spurrd me on that i behind him clambring forcd myself till my feet pressd the circuit plain beneath there both together seated turnd we round to eastward whence was our ascent and oft many beside have with delight lookd back first on the nether shores i turnd my eyes then raisd them to the sun and wondring markd that from the left it smote us soon perceivd that poet sage now at the car of light amazd i stood where twixt us and the north its course it enterd whence he thus to me were ledas offspring now in company of that broad mirror that high up and low imparts his light beneath thou mightst behold the ruddy zodiac nearer to the bears wheel if its ancient course it not forsook how that may be if thou wouldst think within pondring imagine sion with this mount placd on the earth so that to both be one horizon and two hemispheres apart where lies the path that phaeton ill knew to guide his erring chariot thou wilt see how of necessity by this on one he passes while by that on the other side if with clear view shine intellect attend of truth kind teacher i exclaimd so clear aught saw i never as i now discern where seemd my ken to fail that the mid orb of the supernal motion which in terms of art is called the equator and remains ever between the sun and winter for the cause thou hast assignd from hence toward the north departs when those who in the hebrew land inhabit see it towrds the warmer part but if it please thee i would gladly know how far we have to journey for the hill mounts higher than this sight of mine can mount he thus to me such is this steep ascent that it is ever difficult at first but more a man proceeds less evil grows when pleasant it shall seem to thee so much that upward going shall be easy to thee as in a vessel to go down the tide then of this path thou wilt have reachd the end there hope to rest thee from thy toil no more i answer and thus far for certain know as he his words had spoken near to us a voice there sounded yet ye first perchance may to repose you by constraint be led at sound thereof each turnd and on the left a huge stone we beheld of which nor i nor he before was ware thither we drew find there were some who in the shady place behind the rock were standing as a man thru idleness might stand among them one who seemd to me much wearied sat him down and with his arms did fold his knees about holding his face between them downward bent sweet sir i cryd behold that man who shows himself more idle than if laziness were sister to him straight he turnd to us and oer the thigh lifting his face observd then in these accents spake up then proceed thou valiant one straight who it was i knew nor could the pain i felt for want of breath still somewhat urgd me hinder my approach and when i came to him he scarce his head uplifted saying well hast thou discernd how from the left the sun his chariot leads his lazy acts and broken words my lips to laughter somewhat movd when i began belacqua now for thee i grieve no more but tell why thou art seated upright there waitest thou escort to conduct thee hence or blame i only shine accustomd ways then he my brother of what use to mount when to my suffering would not let me pass the bird of god who at the portal sits behooves so long that heavn first bear me round without its limits as in life it bore because i to the end repentant sighs delayd if prayer do not aid me first that riseth up from heart which lives in grace what other kind avails not heard in heaven before me now the poet up the mount ascending cried haste thee for see the sun has touchd the point meridian and the night now covers with her foot maroccos shore canto v now had i left those spirits and pursued the steps of my conductor when beheld pointing the finger at me one exclaimd see how it seems as if the light not shone from the left hand of him beneath and he as living seems to be led on mine eyes i at that sound reverting saw them gaze through wonder first at me and then at me and the light broken underneath by turns why are thy thoughts thus riveted my guide exclaimd that thou hast slackd thy pace or how imports it thee what thing is whisperd here come after me and to their babblings leave the crowd be as a tower that firmly set shakes not its top for any blast that blows he in whose bosom thought on thought shoots out still of his aim is wide in that the one sicklies and wastes to nought the others strength what other could i answer save i come i said it somewhat with that colour tingd which ofttimes pardon meriteth for man meanwhile traverse along the hill there came a little way before us some who sang the miserere in responsive strains when they perceivd that through my body i gave way not for the rays to pass their song straight to a long and hoarse exclaim they changd and two of them in guise of messengers ran on to meet us and inquiring askd of your condition we would gladly learn to them my guide ye may return and bear tidings to them who sent you that his frame is real flesh if as i deem to view his shade they pausd enough is answerd them him let them honour they may prize him well neer saw i fiery vapours with such speed cut through the serene air at fall of night nor augusts clouds athwart the setting sun that upward these did not in shorter space return and there arriving with the rest wheel back on us as with loose rein a troop many exclaimd the bard are these who throng around us to petition thee they come go therefore on and listen as thou gost o spirit who gost on to blessedness with the same limbs that clad thee at thy birth shouting they came a little rest thy step look if thou any one amongst our tribe hast eer beheld that tidings of him there thou mayst report ah wherefore gost thou on ah wherefore tarriest thou not we all by violence died and to our latest hour were sinners but then warnd by light from heavn so that repenting and forgiving we did issue out of life at peace with god who with desire to see him fills our heart then i the visages of all i scan yet none of ye remember but if aught that i can do may please you gentle spirits speak and i will perform it by that peace which on the steps of guide so excellent following from world to world intent i seek in answer he began none here distrusts thy kindness though not promisd with an oath so as the will fail not for want of power whence i who sole before the others speak entreat thee if thou ever see that land which lies between romagna and the realm of charles that of thy courtesy thou pray those who inhabit fano that for me their adorations duly be put up by which i may purge off my grievous sins from thence i came but the deep passages whence issued out the blood wherein i dwelt upon my bosom in antenors land were made where to be more secure i thought the author of the deed was estes prince who more than right could warrant with his wrath pursued me had i towards mira fled when overtaen at oriaco still might i have breathd but to the marsh i sped and in the mire and rushes tangled there

o thou from heavn say wherefore hast thou robbd me thou of him th eternal portion bearst with thee away for one poor tear that he deprives me of but of the other other rule i make thou knowest how in the atmosphere collects that vapour dank returning into water soon as it mounts where cold condenses it that evil will which in his intellect still follows evil came and raisd the wind and smoky mist by virtue of the power given by his nature thence the valley soon as day was spent he coverd oer with cloud from pratomagno to the mountain range and stretchd the sky above so that the air impregnate

speak of peter de la brosse and here while she yet lives that lady of brabant let her beware lest for so false a deed she herd with worse than these when i was freed from all those spirits who prayd for others prayers to hasten on their state of blessedness straight i began o thou my luminary it seems expressly in thy text denied that heavens supreme decree can never bend to supplication yet with this design do these entreat can then their hope be vain or is thy saying not to me reveald he thus to me both what i write is plain and these deceivd not in their hope if well thy mind consider that the sacred height of judgment doth not stoop because loves flame in a short moment all fulfils which he who sojourns here in right should satisfy besides when i this point concluded thus by praying no

thou take me right i mean beatrice her thou shalt behold above upon this mountains crown fair seat of joy then i sir let us mend our speed for now i tire not as before and lo the hill stretches its shadow far he answerd thus our progress with this day shall be as much as we may now dispatch but otherwise than thou supposest is the truth for there thou canst not be ere thou once more behold him back returning who behind the steep is now so hidden that as erst his beam thou dost not break but lo a spirit there stands solitary and toward us looks it will instruct us in the speediest way we soon approachd it o thou lombard spirit how didst thou stand in high abstracted mood scarce moving with slow dignity thine eyes it spoke not aught but let us onward pass eyeing us as a lion on his watch but virgil with entreaty mild advancd requesting it to show the best ascent it answer to his question none returnd but of our country and our kind of life demanded when my courteous guide began

night with moans my caesar why dost thou desert my side come and behold what love among thy people and if no pity touches thee for us come and blush for thine own report for me if it be lawful o almighty power who wast in earth for our sakes crucified are thy just eyes turnd elsewhere or is this a preparation in the wondrous depth of thy sage counsel made for some good end entirely from our reach of thought cut off so are the italian cities all oerthrongd with tyrants and a great marcellus made of every petty factious villager my florence thou mayst well remain unmovd at this digression

november scarce reaches the thread thou in october weavst how many times within thy memory customs and laws and coins and offices have been by thee renewd and people changd if thou rememberst well and canst see clear thou wilt perceive thyself like a sick wretch who finds no rest upon her down but oft shifting her side short respite seeks from pain canto vii after their courteous greetings joyfully sevn times exchangd sordello backward drew exclaiming who are ye before this mount by spirits worthy of ascent to god was sought my bones had by octavius care been buried i am virgil for no sin deprivd of heavn except for lack of faith so answerd him in few my gentle guide as one who aught before him suddenly beholding whence his wonder riseth cries it is yet is not wavring in belief such he appeard then downward bent his eyes and drawing near with reverential step caught him where of mean estate might clasp his lord glory of latium he exclaimd in whom our tongue its utmost power displayd boast of my honord birthplace what desert of mine what favour rather undeservd shows thee to me if i to hear that voice am worthy say if from below thou comst and from what cloisters palethrough every orb of that sad region he replyd thus far am i arrivd by heavnly influence led and with such aid i come there is a place there underneath not made by torments sad but by dun shades alone where mournings voice sounds not of anguish sharp but breathes in sighs there i with little innocents abide who by deaths fangs were bitten ere exempt from human taint there i with those abide who the three holy virtues put not on but understood the rest and without blame followd them all but if thou knowst and canst direct us how we soonest may arrive where purgatory its true beginning takes he answerd thus we have no certain place assignd us upwards i may go or round far as i can i join thee for thy guide but thou beholdest now how day declines and upwards to proceed by night our power excels therefore it may be well to choose a place of pleasant sojourn to the right some spirits sit apart retird if thou consentest i to these will lead thy steps and thou wilt know them not without delight how chances this was answerd who so wishd to ascend by night would he be thence debarrd by other or through his own weakness fail the good sordello then along the ground trailing his finger spoke only this line thou shalt not overpass soon as the sun hath disappeard not that aught else impedes thy going upwards save the shades of night these with the wont of power perplex the will with them thou haply mightst return beneath or to and fro around the mountains side wander while day is in the horizon shut my master straight as wondring at his speech exclaimd then lead us quickly where thou sayst that while we stay we may enjoy delight a little space we were removd from thence when i perceivd the mountain hollowd out evn as large valleys hollowd out on earth that way the escorting spirit cried we go where in a bosom the high bank recedes and thou await renewal of the day betwixt the steep and plain a crooked path led us traverse into the ridges side where more than half the sloping edge expires refulgent gold and silver thrice refind and scarlet grain and ceruse indian wood of lucid dye serene fresh emeralds but newly broken by the herbs and flowers placd in that fair recess in color

flowers here chanting i beheld those spirits sit who not beyond the valley could be seen before the westring sun sink to his bed began the mantuan who our steps had turnd mid those desires not that i lead ye on for from this eminence ye shall discern better the acts and visages of all than in the nether vale among them mixd he who sits high above the rest and seems to have neglected that he should have done and to the others song moves not his lip the emperor rodolph call who might have heald the wounds whereof fair italy hath died so that by others she revives but slowly he who with kindly visage comforts him swayd in that country where the water springs that moldaws river to the elbe and elbe rolls to the ocean ottocar his name who in his swaddling clothes was of more worth than winceslaus his son a bearded man pamperd with rank luxuriousness and ease and that one with the nose depress who close in counsel seems with him of gentle look flying expird withring the lilys flower look there how he doth knock against his breast the other ye behold who for his cheek makes of one hand a couch with frequent sighs they are the father and the fatherinlaw of gallias bane his vicious life they know and foul thence comes the grief that rends them thus he so robust of limb who measure keeps in song with him of feature prominent with evry virtue bore his girdle bracd and if that

his gaze directs aloft us william that brave marquis for whose cause the deed of alexandria and his war makes conferrat and canavese weep canto viii now was the hour that wakens fond desire in men at sea and melts their thoughtful heart who in the morn have bid sweet friends farewell and pilgrim newly on his road with love thrills if he hear the vesper bell from far that seems to mourn for the expiring day when i no longer taking heed to hear began with wonder from those spirits to mark one risen from its seat which with its hand audience implord both palms it joind and raisd fixing its steadfast gaze towards the east as telling god i care for naught beside te lucis ante so devoutly then came from its lip and in so soft a strain that all my sense in ravishment was lost and the rest after softly and devout followd through all the hymn with upward gaze directed to the bright supernal wheels here reader for the truth makes thine eyes keen for of so subtle texture is this veil that thou with ease mayst pass it through unmarkd i saw that gentle band silently next look up as if in expectation held pale and in lowly guise and from on high i saw forth issuing descend beneath two angels with two flameillumind swords broken and mutilated at their points green as the tender leaves but newly born their vesture was the which by wings as green beaten they drew behind them fannd in air a little over us one took his stand the other lighted on the opposing hill so that the troop were in the midst containd well i descried the whiteness on their heads but in their visages the

which path he came i turnd me round and closely pressd all frozen to my leaders trusted side sordello pausd not to the valley now for it is time let us descend and hold converse with those great shadows haply much their sight may please ye only three steps down methinks i measurd ere i was beneath and noted one who lookd as with desire to know me time was now that air arrow dim yet not so dim

fair a burial will not make the viper which calls milan to the field as had been made by shrill galluras bird he spoke and in his visage took the stamp of that right seal which with due temperature glows in the bosom my insatiate eyes meanwhile to heavn had traveld even there where the bright stars are slowest as a wheel nearest the axle when my guide inquird what there aloft my son has caught thy gaze i answerd the three torches with which here the pole is all on fire he then to me the four resplendent stars thou sawst this morn are there beneath and these risn in their stead while yet he spoke sordello to himself drew him and cryd lo there our enemy and with his hand pointed that way to look along the side where barrier none arose around the little vale a serpent lay such haply as gave eve the bitter food between the grass and flowers the evil snake came on reverting oft his lifted head and as a beast that smoothes its polishd coat licking his hack i saw not nor can tell how those celestial falcons from their seat movd but in motion each one well descried hearing the air cut by their verdant plumes the serpent fled and to their stations back the angels up returnd with equal flight the spirit who to nino when he calld had come from viewing me with fixed ken through all that conflict loosend not his sight so may the lamp which leads thee up on high find in thy

prosper your honourd nation not impairs the value of her coffer and her sword nature and use give her such privilege that while the world is twisted from his course by a bad head she only walks aright and has the evil way in scorn he then now pass thee on sevn times the tired sun revisits not the couch which with four feet the forked aries covers ere that kind opinion shall be naild into thy brain with stronger nails than others speech can drive if the sure course of judgment be not stayd canto ix now the fair consort of tithonus old arisen from her mates beloved arms lookd palely oer the eastern cliff her brow lucent with jewels glitterd set in sign of that chill animal who with his train smites fearful nations and where then we were two steps of her ascent the night had past and now the third was closing up its wing when i who had so much of adam with me sank down upon the grass oercome with sleep there where all five were seated in that hour when near the dawn the swallow her sad lay remembring haply ancient grief renews and with our minds more wandrers from the flesh and less by thought restraind are as t were full of holy divination in their dreams then in a vision did i seem to view a goldenfeatherd eagle in the sky with open wings and hovring for descent and i was in that place methought from whence young ganymede from his associates reft was snatchd aloft to the high consistory perhaps thought i within me here alone he strikes his quarry and elsewhere disdains to pounce upon the prey therewith it seemd a little wheeling in his airy tour terrible as the lightning rushd he down and snatchd me upward even to the fire there both i thought the eagle and myself did burn and so intense th imagind flames that needs my sleep was broken off as erst achilles shook himself and round him rolld his wakend eyeballs wondring where he was whenas his mother had from chiron fled to scyros with him sleeping in her arms een thus i shook me soon as from my face the slumber parted turning deadly pale like one icestruck with dread solo at my side my comfort stood and the bright sun was now more than two hours aloft and to the sea my looks were turnd fear not my master cried assurd we are at happy point thy strength shrink not but rise dilated thou art come to purgatory now lo there the cliff that circling bounds it lo the entrance there where it doth seem disparted ere the dawn usherd the daylight when thy wearied soul slept in thee oer the flowery vale beneath a lady came and thus bespake me i am lucia suffer me to take this man who slumbers easier so his way shall speed sordello and the other gentle shapes tarrying she bare thee up and as day shone this summit reachd and i pursued her steps here did she place thee first her lovely eyes that open entrance showd me then at once she vanishd with thy sleep like one whose doubts are chasd by certainty and terror turnd to comfort on discovery of the truth such was the change in me and as my guide beheld me fearless up along the cliff he movd and i behind him towards the height reader thou markest how my theme doth rise nor wonder therefore if more artfully i prop the structure nearer now we drew arrivd whence in that part where first a breach as of a wall appeard i could descry a portal and three steps beneath that led for inlet there of different colour each and one who watchd but spake not yet a word as more and more mine eye did stretch its view i markd him seated on the highest step in visage such as past my power to bear graspd in his hand a naked sword glancd back the rays so toward me that i oft in vain my sight directed speak from whence ye stand he cried what would ye where is your escort take heed your coming upward harm ye not a heavenly dame not skilless of these things replied the instructor told us even now pass that way here the gate isand may she befriending prosper your ascent resumd the courteous keeper of the gate come then before our steps we straightway thither came the lowest stair was marble white so smooth and polishd that therein my mirrord form distinct i saw the next of hue more dark than sablest grain a rough and singed block crackd lengthwise and across the third that lay massy above seemd porphyry that flamd red as the lifeblood spouting from a vein on this gods angel either foot sustaind upon the threshold seated which appeard a rock of diamond up the trinal steps my leader cheerily drew me ask said he with humble heart that he unbar the bolt piously at his holy feet devolvd i cast me praying him for pitys sake that he would open to me but first fell thrice on my bosom prostrate seven times the letter that denotes the inward stain he on my forehead with the blunted point of his drawn sword inscribd and look he cried when enterd that thou wash these scars away ashes or earth taen dry out of the ground were of one colour with the robe he wore from underneath that vestment forth he drew two keys of metal twain the one was gold its fellow silver with the pallid first and next the burnishd he so plyd the gate as to content me well whenever one faileth of these that in the keyhole straight it turn not to this alley then expect access in vain such were the words he spake one is more precious but the other needs skill and sagacity large share of each ere its good task to disengage the knot be worthily performd from peter these i hold of him instructed that i err rather in opening than in keeping fast so but the suppliant at my feet implore then of that hallowd gate he thrust the door exclaiming enter but this warning hear he forth again departs who looks behind as in the hinges of that sacred ward the swivels turnd sonorous metal strong harsh was the grating nor so surlily roard the tarpeian when by force bereft of good metellus thenceforth from his loss to leanness doomd attentively i turnd listning the thunder that first issued forth and we praise thee o god methought i heard in accents blended with sweet melody the strains came oer mine ear een as the sound of choral voices that in solemn chant with organ mingle and now high and clear come swelling now float indistinct away canto x when we had passed the threshold of the gate which the souls ill affection doth disuse making the crooked seem the straighter path i heard its closing sound had mine eyes turnd for that offence what plea might have availd we mounted up the riven rock that wound on either side alternate as the wave flies and advances here some little art behooves us said my leader that our steps observe the varying flexure of the path thus we so slowly sped that with cleft orb the moon once more oerhangs her watry couch ere we that strait have threaded but when free we came and open where the mount above one solid mass retires i spent with toil and both uncertain of the way we stood upon a plain more lonesome than the roads that traverse desert wilds from whence the brink borders upon vacuity to foot of the steep bank that rises still the space had measurd thrice the stature of a man and distant as mine eye could wing its flight to leftward now and now to right dispatchd that cornice equal in extent appeard not yet our feet had on that summit movd when i discoverd that the bank around whose proud uprising all ascent denied was marble white and so exactly wrought with quaintest sculpture that not there alone had polycletus but een natures self been shamd the angel who came down to earth with tidings of the peace so many years wept for in vain that opd the heavenly gates from their long interdict before us seemd in a sweet act so sculpturd to the life he lookd no silent image one had sworn he had said hail for she was imagd there by whom the key did open to gods love and in her act as sensibly impress that word behold the handmaid of the lord as figure seald on wax fix not thy mind on one place only said the guide belovd who had me near him on that part where lies the heart of man my sight forthwith i turnd and markd behind the virgin mothers form upon that side where he that movd me stood another story graven on the rock i passed athwart the bard and drew me near that it might stand more aptly for my view there in the selfsame marble were engravd the cart and kine drawing the sacred ark that from unbidden office awes mankind before it came much people and the whole parted in seven quires one sense cried nay another yes they sing like doubt arose betwixt the eye and smell from the curld fume of incense breathing up the wellwrought toil preceding the blest vessel

gregory to earn his mighty conquest trajan th emperor a widow at his bridle stood attird in tears and mourning round about them troopd full throng of knights and overhead in gold the eagles floated struggling with the wind the wretch appeard amid all these to say grant vengeance sire for woe beshrew this heart my son is murderd he replying seemd wait now till i return and she as one made hasty by her grief o sire if thou dost not returnwhere i am who then is may right theewhat to thee is others good if thou neglect thy ownnow comfort thee at length he answers it beseemeth well my duty be performd ere i move hence so justice wills and pity bids me stay he whose ken nothing new surveys producd that visible speaking new to us and strange the like not found on earth fondly i gazd upon those patterns of meek humbleness shapes yet more precious for their artists sake when lo the poet whisperd where this way but slack their pace a multitude advance these to the lofty steps shall guide

upon that highway drawn sevn sons on either side thee slain o saul how ghastly didst thou look on thine own sword expiring in gilboa from that hour neer visited with rain from heavn or dew o fond arachne thee i also saw half spider now in anguish crawling up th unfinishd web thou weavedst to thy bane o rehoboam here thy shape doth seem louring no more defiance but fearsmote with none to chase him in his chariot whirld was shown beside upon the solid floor how dear alcmaeon forcd his mother rate that ornament in evil hour receivd how in the temple on sennacherib fell his sons and how a

assyrians holofernes slain and een the relics of the carnage troy i markd in ashes and in caverns oh how falln how abject ilion was thy semblance there what master of the pencil or the style had tracd the shades and lines that might have made the subtlest workman wonder dead the dead the living seemd alive with clearer view his eye beheld not who beheld the truth than mine what i did tread on while i went low bending now swell out and with stiff necks pass on ye sons of eve veil not your looks lest they descry the evil of your path i noted not so busied was my thought how much we now had circled of the mount and of his course yet more the sun had spent when he who with still wakeful caution went admonishd raise thou up thy head for know time is not now for slow suspense behold that way an angel hasting towards us lo where duly the sixth handmaid doth return from service on the day wear thou in look and gesture seemly grace of reverent awe that gladly he may forward us aloft consider that this day neer dawns again times loss he had so often warnd me gainst i could not miss the scope at which he aimd the goodly shape approachd us snowy white in vesture and with visage casting streams of tremulous lustre like the matin star his arms he opend then his wings and spake onward the steps behold are near and now th ascent is without difficulty gaind a scanty few are they who when they hear such tidings hasten o ye race of men though born to soar why suffer ye a wind so slight to baffle ye he led us on where the rock parted here against my front did beat his wings then promisd i should fare in safety on my way as to ascend that steep upon whose brow the chapel stands oer rubaconte looking lordly down on the wellguided city up the right th impetuous rise is broken by the steps carvd in that old and simple age when still the registry and label rested safe thus is th acclivity relievd which here precipitous from the other circuit falls but on each hand the tall cliff presses close as entring there we turnd voices in strain ineffable sang blessed are the poor in spirit ah how far unlike to these the straits of hell here songs to usher us there shrieks of woe we climb the holy stairs and lighter to myself by far i seemd than on the plain before whence thus i spake say master of what heavy thing have i been lightend that scarce aught the sense of toil affects me journeying he in few replied when sins broad characters that yet remain upon thy temples though well nigh effacd shall be as one is all clean razed out then shall thy feet by heartiness of will be so oercome they not alone shall feel no sense of labour but delight much more shall wait them urgd along their upward way then like to one upon whose head is placd somewhat he deems not of but from the becks of others as they pass him by his hand lends therefore help to assure him searches finds and well performs such office as the eye wants power to execute so stretching forth the fingers of my right hand did i find six only of the letters which his sword who bare the keys had tracd upon my brow the leader as he markd mine action smild canto xiii we reachd the summit of the scale and stood upon the second buttress of that mount which healeth him who climbs a cornice there like to the former girdles round the hill save that its arch with sweep less ample bends shadow nor image there is seen all smooth the rampart and the path reflecting nought but the rocks sullen hue if here we wait for some to question said the bard i fear our choice may haply meet too long delay then fixedly upon the sun his eyes he fastnd made his right the central point from whence to move and turnd the left aside o pleasant light my confidence and hope conduct us thou he cried on this new way where now i venture leading to the bourn we seek the universal world to thee owes warmth and lustre if no other cause forbid thy beams should ever be our guide far as is measurd for a mile on earth in brief space had we journeyd such prompt will impelld and towards us flying now were heard spirits invisible who courteously unto loves table bade the welcome guest the voice that first flew by calld forth aloud they have no wine so on behind us past those sounds reiterating nor yet lost in the faint distance when another came crying i am orestes and alike wingd its fleet way oh father i exclaimd what tongues are these and as i questiond lo a third exclaiming love ye those have wrongd you this circuit said my teacher knots the scourge for envy and the cords are therefore drawn by charitys correcting hand the curb is of a harsher sound as thou shalt hear if i deem rightly ere thou reach the pass where pardon sets them free but fix thine eyes intently through the air and thou shalt see a multitude before thee seated each along the shelving grot then more than erst i opd my eyes before me viewd and saw shadows with garments dark as was the rock and when we passd a little forth i heard a crying blessed mary pray for us michael and peter all ye saintly host i do not think there walks on earth this day man so remorseless that he hath not yearnd with pity at the sight that next i saw mine eyes a load of sorrow teemed when now i stood so near them that their semblances came clearly to my view of sackcloth vile their covring seemd and on his shoulder one did stay another leaning and all leand against the cliff een thus the blind and poor near the confessionals to crave an alms stand each his head upon his fellows sunk so most to stir compassion not by sound of words alone but that which moves not less the sight of misry and as never beam of noonday visiteth the eyeless man een so was heavn a niggard unto these of his fair light for through the orbs of all a thread of wire impiercing knits them up as for the taming of a haggard hawk it were a wrong methought to pass and look on others yet myself the while unseen to my sage counsel therefore did i turn he knew the meaning of the mute appeal nor waited for my questioning but said speak and be brief be subtle in thy words on that part of the cornice whence no rim engarlands its steep fall did virgil come on the other side me were the spirits their cheeks bathing devout with penitential tears that through the dread impalement forcd a way i turnd me to them and o shades said i assurd that to your eyes unveild shall shine the lofty light sole object of your wish so may heavens grace clear whatsoeer of foam floats turbid on the conscience that thenceforth the stream of mind roll limpid from its source as ye declare for so shall ye impart a boon i dearly prize if any soul of latium dwell among ye and perchance that soul may profit if i learn so much my brother we are each one citizens of one true city any thou wouldst say who lived a stranger in italias land so heard i answering as appeald a voice that onward came some space from whence i stood a spirit i noted in whose look was markd expectance ask ye how the chin was raisd as in one reft of sight spirit said i who for thy rise are tutoring if thou be that which didst answer to me or by place or name disclose thyself that i may know thee i was it answerd of sienna here i cleanse away with these the evil life soliciting with tears that he who is vouchsafe him to us though sapia namd in sapience i excelld not gladder far of others hurt than of the good befell me that thou mayst own i now deceive thee not hear if my folly were not as i speak it when now my years slopd waning down the arch it so bechancd my fellow citizens near colle met their enemies in the field and i prayd god to grant what he had willd there were they vanquishd and betook themselves unto the bitter passages of flight i markd the hunt and waxing out of bounds in gladness lifted up my shameless brow and like the merlin cheated by a gleam cried it is over heavn i fear thee not upon my verge of life i wishd for peace with god nor repentance had supplied what i did lack of duty were it not the hermit piero touchd with charity in his devout orisons thought on me but who art thou that questionst of our state who gost to my belief with lids unclosd and breathest in thy talkmine eyes said i may yet be here taen from me but not long for they have not offended grievously with envious glances but the woe beneath urges my soul with more exceeding dread that nether load already weighs me down she thus who then amongst us here aloft hath brought thee if thou weenest to return he answerd i who standeth mute beside me i live of me ask therefore chosen spirit if thou desire i yonder yet should move for thee my mortal feetoh she replied this is so strange a thing it is great sign that god doth love thee therefore with thy prayer sometime assist me and by that i crave which most thou covetest that if thy feet eer tread on tuscan soil thou save my fame amongst my kindred them shalt thou behold with that vain multitude who set their hope on telamones haven there to fail confounded more shall when the fancied stream they sought of dian calld but they who lead their navies more than ruind hopes shall mourn canto xiv say who is he around our mountain winds or ever death has prund his wing for flight that opes his eyes and covers them at will i know not who he is but know thus much he comes not singly do thou ask of him for thou art nearer to him and take heed accost him gently so that he may speak thus on the right two spirits bending each toward the other talkd of me then both addressing me their faces backward leand and thus the one began o soul who yet pent in the body tendest towards the sky for charity we pray thee comfort us recounting whence thou comst and who thou art for thou dost make us at the favour shown thee marvel as at a thing that neer hath been there stretches through the midst of tuscany i straight began a brooklet whose wellhead springs up in falterona with his race not satisfied when he some hundred miles hath measurd from his banks bring i this frame to tell you who i am were words misspent for yet my name scarce sounds on rumours lip if well i do incorprate with my thought the meaning of thy speech said he who first addrest me thou dost speak of arnos wave to whom the other why hath he conceald the title of that river as a man doth of some horrible thing the spirit who thereof was questiond did acquit him thus i know not but tis fitting well the name should perish of that vale for from the source where teems so plenteously the alpine steep maimd of pelorus that doth scarcely pass beyond that limit even to the point whereunto ocean is restord what heaven drains from th exhaustless store for all earths streams throughout the space is virtue worried down as twere a snake by all for mortal foe or through disastrous influence on the place or else distortion of misguided wills that custom goads to evil whence in those the dwellers in that miserable vale nature is so transformd it seems as they had shard of circes feeding midst brute swine worthier of acorns than of other food created for mans use he shapeth first his obscure way then sloping onward finds curs snarlers more in spite than power from whom he turns with scorn aside still journeying down by how much more the curst and luckless foss swells out to largeness een so much it finds dogs turning into wolves descending still through yet more hollow eddies next he meets a race of foxes so replete with craft they do not fear that skill can master it nor will i cease because my words are heard by other ears than thine it shall be well for this man if he keep in memory what from no erring spirit i reveal lo i behold thy grandson that becomes a hunter of those wolves upon the shore of the fierce stream and cows them all with dread their flesh yet living sets he up to sale then like an aged beast to slaughter dooms many of life he reaves himself of worth and goodly estimation smeard with gore mark how he issues from the rueful wood leaving such havoc that in thousand years it spreads not to prime lustihood again as one who tidings hears of woe to come changes his looks perturbd from whateer part the peril grasp him so beheld i change that spirit who had turnd to listen struck with sadness soon as he had caught the word his visage and the others speech did raise desire in me to know the names of both whereof with meek entreaty i inquird the shade who late addrest me thus resumd thy wish imports that i vouchsafe to do for thy sake what thou wilt not do for mine but since gods will is that so largely shine his grace in thee i will be liberal too guido of duca know then that i am envy so parchd my blood that had i seen a fellow man made joyous thou hadst markd a livid paleness overspread my cheek such harvest reap i of the seed i sowd o man why place thy heart where there doth need exclusion of participants in good this is rinieris spirit this the boast and honour of the house of calboli where of his worth no heritage remains nor his the only blood that hath been stript twixt po the mount the reno and the shore of all that truth or fancy asks for bliss but in those limits such a growth has sprung of rank and venomd roots as long would mock slow cultures toil where is good lizio where manardi traversalo and carpigna o bastard slips of old romagnas line when in bologna the low artisan and in faenza yon bernardin sprouts a gentle cyon from ignoble stem wonder not tuscan if thou see me weep when i recall to mind those once lovd names guido of prata and of azzo him that dwelt with you tignoso and his troop with traversaros house and anastagios each race disherited and beside these the ladies and the knights the toils and ease that witchd us into love and courtesy where now such malice reigns in recreant hearts o brettinoro wherefore tarriest still since forth of thee thy family hath gone and many hating evil joind their steps well doeth he that bids his lineage cease bagnacavallo castracaro ill and conio worse who care to propagate a race of counties from such blood as theirs well shall ye also do pagani then when from amongst you tries your demon child not so howeer that henceforth there remain true proof of what ye were o hugolin thou sprung of fantolinis line thy name is safe since none is lookd for after thee to cloud its lustre warping from thy stock but tuscan go thy ways for now i take far more delight in weeping than in words such pity for your sakes hath wrung my heart we knew those gentle spirits at parting heard our steps their silence therefore of our way assurd us soon as we had quitted them advancing onward lo a voice that seemd like vollied lightning when it rives the air met us and shouted whosoever finds will slay me then fled from us as the bolt lancd sudden from a downwardrushing cloud when it had givn short truce unto our hearing behold the other with a crash as loud as the quickfollowing thunder mark in me aglauros turnd to rock i at the sound retreating drew more closely to my guide now in mute stillness rested all the air and thus he spake there was the galling bit but your old enemy so baits his hook he drags you eager to him hence nor curb avails you nor reclaiming call heavn calls and round about you wheeling courts your gaze with everlasting beauties yet your eye turns with fond doting still upon the earth therefore he smites you who discerneth all canto xv as much as twixt the third hours close and dawn appeareth of heavns sphere that ever whirls as restless as an infant in his play so much appeard remaining to the sun of his slope journey towards the western goal evening was there and here the noon of night and full upon our forehead smote the beams for round the mountain circling so our path had led us that toward the sunset now direct we journeyd when i felt a weight of more exceeding splendour than before press on my front the cause unknown amaze possessd me and both hands against my brow lifting i interposd them as a screen that of its gorgeous superflux of light clippd the diminishd orb as when the ray striking on water or the surface clear of mirror leaps unto the opposite part ascending at a glance een as it fell and so much differs from the stone that falls through equal space as practice skill hath shown thus with refracted light before me seemed the ground there smitten whence in sudden haste my sight recoild what is this sire belovd gainst which i strive to shield the sight in vain cried i and which towards us moving seems marvel not if the family of heavn he answerd yet with dazzling radiance dim thy sense it is a messenger who comes inviting mans ascent such sights ere long not grievous shall impart to thee delight as thy perception is by nature wrought up to their pitch the blessed angel soon as we had reachd him haild us with glad voice here enter on a ladder far less steep than ye have yet encounterd we forthwith ascending heard behind us chanted sweet blessed the merciful and happy thou that conquerst lonely each my guide and i pursued our upward way and as we went some profit from his words i hopd to win and thus of him inquiring framd my speech what meant romagnas spirit when he spake of bliss exclusive with no partner shard he straight replied no wonder since he knows what sorrow waits on his own worst defect if he chide others that they less may mourn because ye point your wishes at a mark where by communion of possessors part is lessend envy bloweth up the sighs of men no fear of that might touch ye if the love of higher sphere exalted your desire for there by how much more they call it ours so much propriety of each in good increases more and heightend charity wraps that fair cloister in a brighter flame now lack i satisfaction more said i than if thou hadst been silent at the first and doubt more gathers on my labring thought how can it chance that good distributed the many that possess it makes more rich than if t were shard by few he answering thus thy mind reverting still to things of earth strikes darkness from true light the highest good unlimited ineffable doth so speed to love as beam to lucid body darts giving as much of ardour as it finds the sempiternal effluence streams abroad spreading wherever charity extends so that the more aspirants to that bliss are multiplied more good is there to love and more is lovd as mirrors that reflect each unto other propagated light if these my words avail not to allay thy thirsting beatrice thou shalt see who of this want and of all else thou hast shall rid thee to the full provide but thou that from thy temples may be soon erasd een as the two already those five scars that when they pain thee worst then kindliest heal thou i had said contentst me when i saw the other round was gaind and wondring eyes did keep me mute there suddenly i seemd by an ecstatic vision wrapt away and in a temple saw methought a crowd of many persons and at th entrance stood a dame whose sweet demeanour did express a mothers love who said child why hast thou dealt with us thus behold thy sire and i sorrowing have sought thee and so held her peace and straight the vision fled a female next appeard before me down whose visage coursd those waters that grief forces out from one by deep resentment stung who seemd to say if thou pisistratus be lord indeed over this city namd with such debate of adverse gods and whence each science sparkles avenge thee of those arms whose bold embrace hath claspd our daughter and to fuel meseemd benign and meek with visage undisturbd her sovran spake how shall we those requite who wish us evil if we thus condemn the man that loves us after that i saw a multitude in fury burning slay with stones a stripling youth and shout amain destroy destroy and him i saw who bowd heavy with death unto the ground yet made his eyes unfolded upward gates to heavn praying forgiveness of th almighty sire amidst that cruel conflict on his foes with looks that with compassion to their aim soon as my spirit from her airy flight returning sought again the things whose truth depends not on her shaping i observd how she had rovd to no unreal scenes meanwhile the leader who might see i movd as one who struggles to shake off his sleep exclaimd what ails thee that thou canst not hold thy footing firm but more than half a league hast traveld with closd eyes and tottring gait like to a man by wine or sleep oerchargd beloved father so thou deign said i to listen i will tell thee what appeard before me when so faild my sinking steps he thus not if thy countenance were maskd with hundred vizards could a thought of thine how small soeer elude me what thou sawst was shown that freely thou mightst ope thy heart to the waters of peace that flow diffusd from their eternal fountain i not askd what ails thee for such cause as he doth who looks only with that eye which sees no more when spiritless the body lies but askd to give fresh vigour to thy foot such goads the slow and loitring need that they be found not wanting when their hour of watch returns so on we journeyd through the evening sky gazing intent far onward as our eyes with level view could stretch against the bright vespertine ray and lo by slow degrees gathring a fog made towrds us dark as night there was no room for scaping and that mist bereft us both of sight and the pure air canto xvi hells dunnest gloom or night unlustrous dark of every planes reft and palld in clouds did never spread before the sight a veil in thickness like that fog nor to the sense so palpable and gross entring its shade mine eye endured not with unclosed lids which marking near me drew the faithful guide offering me his shoulder for a stay as the blind man behind his leader walks lest he should err or stumble unawares on what might harm him or perhaps destroy i journeyd through that bitter air and foul still listning to my escorts warning voice look that from me thou part not straight i heard voices and each one seemd to pray for peace and for compassion to the lamb of god that taketh sins away their prelude still was agnus dei and through all the choir one voice one measure ran that perfect seemd the concord of their song are these i hear spirits o master i exclaimd and he thou aimst aright these loose the bonds of wrath now who art thou that through our smoke dost cleave and speakst of us as thou thyself een yet dividest time by calends so one voice bespake me whence my master said reply and ask if upward hence the passage lead o being who dost make thee pure to stand beautiful once more in thy makers sight along with me and thou shalt hear and wonder thus i whereto the spirit answering spake long as t is lawful for me shall my steps follow on thine and since the cloudy smoke forbids the seeing hearing in its stead shall keep us joind i then forthwith began yet in my mortal swathing i ascend to higher regions and am hither come through the fearful agony of hell and if so largely god hath doled his grace that clean beside all modern precedent he wills me to behold his kingly state from me conceal not who thou wast ere death had loosd thee but instruct me and instruct if rightly to the pass i tend thy words the way directing as a safe escort i was of lombardy and marco calld not inexperiencd of the world that worth i still affected from which all have turnd the nerveless bow aside thy course tends right unto the summit and replying thus he added i beseech thee pray for me when thou shalt come aloft and i to him accept my faith for pledge i will perform what thou requirest yet one doubt remains that wrings me sorely if i solve it not singly before it urgd me doubled now by thine opinion when i couple that with one elsewhere declard each strengthning other the world indeed is even so forlorn of all good as thou speakst it and so swarms with every evil yet beseech thee point the cause out to me that myself may see and unto others show it for in heaven one places it and one on earth below then heaving forth a deep and audible sigh brother he thus began the world is blind and thou in truth comst from it ye who live do so each cause refer to heavn above een as its motion of necessity drew with it all that moves if this were so free choice in you were none nor justice would there should be joy for virtue woe for ill your movements have their primal bent from heaven not all yet said i all what then ensues light have ye still to follow evil or good and of the will free power which if it stand firm and unwearied in heavns first assay conquers at last so it be cherishd well triumphant over all to mightier force to better nature subject ye abide free not constraind by that which forms in you the reasoning mind uninfluencd of the stars if then the present race of mankind err seek in yourselves the cause and find it there herein thou shalt confess me no false spy forth from his plastic hand who charmd beholds her image ere she yet exist the soul comes like a babe that wantons sportively weeping and laughing in its wayward moods as artless and as ignorant of aught save that her maker being one who dwells with gladness ever willingly she turns to whateer yields her joy of some slight good the flavour soon she tastes and snard by that with fondness she pursues it if no guide recall no rein direct her wandring course hence it behovd the law should be a curb a sovereign hence behovd whose piercing view might mark at least the fortress and main tower of the true city laws indeed there are but who is he observes them none not he who goes before the shepherd of the flock who chews the cud but doth not cleave the hoof therefore the multitude who see their guide strike at the very good they covet most feed there and look no further thus the cause is not corrupted nature in yourselves but illconducting that hath turnd the world to evil rome that turnd it unto good was wont to boast two suns whose several beams cast light on either way the worlds and gods one since hath quenchd the other and the sword is grafted on the crook and so conjoind each must perforce decline to worse unawd by fear of other if thou doubt me mark the blade each herb is judgd of by its seed that land through which adice and the po their waters roll was once the residence of courtesy and velour ere the day that frownd on frederick now secure may pass those limits whosoeer hath left for shame to talk with good men or come near their haunts three aged ones are still found there in whom the old time chides the new these deem it long ere god restore them to a better world the good gherardo of palazzo he conrad and guido of castello namd in gallic phrase more fitly the plain lombard on this at last conclude the church of rome mixing two governments that ill assort hath missd her footing falln into the mire and there herself and burden much defild o marco i replied shine arguments convince me and the cause i now discern why of the heritage no portion came to levis offspring but resolve me this who that gherardo is that as thou sayst is left a sample of the perishd race and for rebuke to this untoward age either thy words said he deceive or else are meant to try me that thou speaking tuscan appearst not to have heard of good gherado the sole addition that by which i know him unless i borrowd from his daughter gaia another name to grace him god be with you i bear you company no more behold the dawn with white ray glimmring through the mist i must awaythe angel comesere he appear he said and would not hear me more canto xvii call to remembrance reader if thou eer hast on a mountain top been taen by cloud through which thou sawst no better than the mole doth through opacous membrane then wheneer the watry vapours dense began to melt into thin air how faintly the suns sphere seemd wading through them so thy nimble thought may image how at first i rebeheld the sun that bedward now his couch oerhung thus with my leaders feet still equaling pace from forth that cloud i came when now expird the parting beams from off the nether shores o quick and forgetive power that sometimes dost so rob us of ourselves we take no mark though round about us thousand trumpets clang what moves thee if the senses stir not light kindled in heavn spontaneous selfinformd or likelier gliding down with swift illapse by will divine portrayd before me came the traces of her dire impiety whose form was changd into the bird that most delights itself in song and here my mind was inwardly so wrapt it gave no place to aught that askd admittance from without next showerd into my fantasy a shape as of one crucified whose visage spake fell rancour malice deep wherein he died and round him ahasuerus the great king esther his bride and mordecai the just blameless in word and deed as of itself that unsubstantial coinage of the brain burst like a bubble which the water fails that fed it in my vision straight uprose a damsel weeping loud and cried o queen o mother wherefore has intemperate ire drivn thee to loath thy being not to lose lavinia desprate thou hast slain thyself now hast thou lost me i am she whose tears mourn ere i fall a mothers timeless end een as a sleep breaks off if suddenly new radiance strike upon the closed lids the broken slumber quivering ere it dies thus from before me sunk that imagery vanishing soon as on my face there struck the light outshining far our earthly beam as round i turnd me to survey what place i had arrivd at here ye mount exclaimd a voice that other purpose left me none save will so eager to behold who spake i could not choose but gaze as fore the sun that weighs our vision down and veils his form in light transcendent thus my virtue faild unequal this is spirit from above who marshals us our upward way unsought and in his own light shrouds him as a man doth for himself so now is done for us for whoso waits imploring yet sees need of his prompt aidance sets himself prepard for blunt denial ere the suit be made refuse we not to lend a ready foot at such inviting haste we to ascend before it darken for we may not then till morn again return so spake my guide and to one ladder both addressd our steps and the first stair approaching i perceivd near me as twere the waving of a wing that fannd my face and whisperd blessed they the peacemakers they know not evil wrath now to such height above our heads were raisd the last beams followd close by hooded night that many a star on all sides through the gloom shone out why partest from me o my strength so with myself i commund for i felt my oertoild sinews slacken we had reachd the summit and were fixd like to a bark arrivd at land and waiting a short space if aught should meet mine ear in that new round then to my guide i turnd and said lovd sire declare what guilt is on this circle purgd if our feet rest no need thy speech should pause he thus to me the love of good whateer wanted of just proportion here fulfils here plies afresh the oar that loiterd ill but that thou mayst yet clearlier understand give ear unto my words and thou shalt cull some fruit may please thee well from this delay creator nor created being neer my son he thus began was without love or natural or the free spirits growth thou hast not that to learn the natural still is without error but the other swerves if on ill object bent or through excess of vigour or defect while eer it seeks the primal blessings or with measure due th inferior no delight that flows from it partakes of ill but let it warp to evil or with more ardour than behooves or less pursue the good the thing created then works gainst its maker hence thou must infer that love is germin of each virtue in ye and of each act no less that merits pain now since it may not be but love intend the welfare mainly of the thing it loves all from selfhatred are secure and since no being can be thought t exist apart and independent of the first a bar of equal force restrains from hating that grant the distinction just and it remains the evil must be anothers which is lovd three ways such love is genderd in your clay there is who hopes his neighbours worth deprest preeminence himself and coverts hence for his own greatness that another fall there is who so much fears the loss of power fame favour glory should his fellow mount above him and so sickens at the thought he loves their opposite and there is he whom wrong or insult seems to gall and shame that he doth thirst for vengeance and such needs must doat on others evil here beneath this threefold love is mournd of th other sort be now instructed that which follows good but with disorderd and irregular course all indistinctly apprehend a bliss on which the soul may rest the hearts of all yearn after it and to that wished bourn all therefore strive to tend if ye behold or seek it with a love remiss and lax this cornice after just repenting lays its penal torment on ye other good there is where man finds not his happiness it is not true fruition not that blest essence of every good the branch and root the love too lavishly bestowd on this along three circles over us is mournd account of that division tripartite expect not fitter for thine own research canto xviii the teacher ended and his high discourse concluding earnest in my looks inquird if i appeard content and i whom still unsated thirst to hear him urgd was mute mute outwardly yet inwardly i said perchance my too much questioning offends but he true father markd the secret wish by diffidence restraind and speaking gave me boldness thus to speak master my sight gathers so lively virtue from thy beams that all thy words convey distinct is seen wherefore i pray thee father whom this heart holds dearest thou wouldst deign by proof t unfold that love from which as from their source thou bringst all good deeds and their opposite he then to what i now disclose be thy clear ken directed and thou plainly shalt behold how much those blind have errd who make themselves the guides of men the soul created apt to love moves versatile which way soeer aught pleasing prompts her soon as she is wakd by pleasure into act of substance true your apprehension forms its counterfeit and in you the ideal shape presenting attracts the souls regard if she thus drawn incline toward it love is that inclining and a new nature knit by pleasure in ye then as the fire points up and mounting seeks his birthplace and his lasting seat een thus enters the captive soul into desire which is a spiritual motion that neer rests before enjoyment of the thing it loves enough to show thee how the truth from those is hidden who aver all love a thing praiseworthy in itself although perhaps its substance seem still good yet if the wax be good it follows not th impression must what love is i returnd thy

erect and faded face with loves own hue illumd recovring speech she forthwith warbling such a strain began that i how loth soeer could scarce have held attention from the song i thus she sang i am the

round i turnd mine eyes and thus the teacher at the least three times my voice hath calld thee rise begone let us the opening find where thou mayst pass i straightway rose now day pourd down from high filld all the circuits of the sacred mount and as we journeyd on our shoulder smote the early ray i followd stooping low my forehead as a man oerchargd with thought who bends him to the likeness of an arch that midway spans the flood when thus i heard come enter here in tone so soft and mild as never met the ear on mortal strand with swanlike wings dispread and pointing up who thus had spoken marshald us along where each side of the solid masonry the sloping walls retird then movd his plumes and fanning us affirmd that those who mourn are blessed for that comfort shall be theirs what aileth thee that still thou lookst to earth began my leader while th angelic shape a little over us his station took new vision i replied hath raisd in me surmizings strange and anxious doubts whereon

penal woes both hope and justice mitigate direct towrds the steep rising our uncertain way if ye approach secure from this our doom prostrationand would urge your course with speed see that ye still to rightward keep the brink so them the bard besought and such the words beyond us some short space in answer came i noted what remaind yet hidden from them thence to my lieges eyes mine eyes i bent and he forthwith interpreting their suit beckond his glad assent free then to act as pleasd me i drew near and took my stand oer that shade whose words i late had markd and spirit i said in whom repentant tears mature that blessed hour when thou with god shalt find acceptance for a while suspend for me that mightier care say who thou wast why thus ye grovel on your bellies prone and if in aught ye wish my service there whence living i am come he answering spake the cause why heavn our back toward his cope reverses shalt thou know but me know first the successor of peter and the name and title of my lineage from that stream that twixt chiaveri and siestri draws his limpid waters through the lowly glen a month and little more by proof i learnt with what a weight that robe of sovreignty upon his shoulder rests who from the mire would guard it that each other fardel seems but feathers in the balance late alas was my conversion but when i became romes pastor i discernd at once the dream and cozenage of life saw that the heart rested not there and yet no prouder height lurd on the climber wherefore of that life no more enamourd in my bosom love of purer being kindled for till then i was a soul in misery alienate from god and covetous of all earthly things now as thou seest here punishd for my doting such cleansing from the taint of avarice do spirits converted need this mount inflicts no direr penalty een as our eyes fastend below nor eer to loftier clime were lifted thus hath justice leveld us here on the earth as avarice quenchd our love of good without which is no working thus here justice holds us prisond hand and foot chaind down and bound while heavens just lord shall please so long to tarry motionless outstretchd my knees i stoopd and would have

and how poor thou wast it added witness that low roof where thou didst lay thy sacred burden down o good fabricius thou didst virtue choose with poverty before great wealth with vice the words so pleasd me that desire to know the spirit from whose lip they seemd to come did draw me onward yet it spake the gift of nicholas which on the maidens he bounteous bestowd to save their youthful prime unblemishd spirit who dost speak of deeds so worthy tell me who thou was i said and why thou dost with single voice renew memorial of such praise that boon vouchsafd haply shall meet reward if i return to finish the short pilgrimage of life still speeding to its close on restless wing i answerd he will tell thee not for hell which thence i look for but that in thyself grace so exceeding

ascends declare o crassus for thou knowst the flavour of thy gold the voice of each now high now low as each his impulse prompts is led through many a pitch acute or grave therefore not singly i erewhile rehearsd that blessedness we tell of in the day but near me none beside his accent raisd from him we now had parted and essayd with utmost efforts to surmount the way when i did feel as nodding to its fall the mountain tremble whence an icy chill seizd on me as on one to death conveyd so shook not delos when latona there couchd to bring forth the twinborn eyes of heaven forthwith from every side a shout arose so vehement that suddenly my guide drew near and cried doubt not while i conduct thee glory all shouted such the sounds mine ear gatherd from those who near me swelld the sounds glory in the highest be to god we stood immovably suspended like to those the shepherds who first heard in bethlehems field that song till ceasd the trembling and the song was ended then our hallowd path resumd eying the prostrate shadows who renewd their customd mourning never in my breast did ignorance so struggle with desire of knowledge if my memory do not err as in that moment nor through haste dard i to question nor myself could aught discern so on i fard in thoughtfulness and dread canto xxi the natural thirst neer quenchd but from the well whereof the woman of samaria cravd excited haste along the cumberd path after my guide impelld and pity movd my bosom for the vengeful deed though just when lo even as luke relates that christ appeard unto the two upon their way newrisen from his vaulted grave to us a shade appeard and after us approachd contemplating the crowd beneath its feet we were not ware of it so first it spake saying god give you peace my brethren then sudden we turnd and virgil such salute as fitted that kind greeting gave and cried peace in the blessed council be thy lot awarded by that righteous court which me to everlasting banishment exiles how he exclaimd nor from his speed meanwhile desisting if that ye be spirits whom god vouchsafes not room above who up the height has been thus far your guide to whom the bard if thou observe the tokens which this man tracd by the finger of the angel bears tis plain that in the kingdom of the just he needs must share but sithence she whose wheel spins day and night for him not yet had drawn that yarn which on the fatal distaff pild clotho apportions to each wight that breathes his soul that sister is to mine and thine not of herself could mount for not like ours her ken whence i from forth the ample gulf of hell was taen to lead him and will lead far as my lore avails but if thou know instruct us for what cause the mount erewhile thus shook and trembled wherefore all at once seemd shouting even from his wavewashd foot that questioning so tallied with my wish the thirst did feel abatement of its edge een from expectance he forthwith replied in its devotion nought irregular this mount can witness or by punctual rule unsanctiond here from every change exempt other than that which heaven in itself doth of itself receive no influence can reach us tempest none shower hail or snow hoar frost or dewy moistness higher falls than that brief scale of threefold steps thick clouds nor scudding rack are ever seen swift glance neer lightens nor thaumantian iris gleams that yonder often shift on each side heavn vapour adust doth never mount above the highest of the trinal stairs whereon peters vicegerent stands lower perchance with various motion rockd trembles the soil but here through wind in earths deep hollow pent i know not how yet never trembled then trembles when any spirit feels itself so purified that it may rise or move for rising and such loud acclaim ensues purification by the will alone is provd that free to change society seizes the soul rejoicing in her will desire of bliss is present from the first but strong propension hinders to that wish by the just ordinance of heavn opposd propension now as eager to fulfil th allotted torment as erewhile to sin and i who in this punishment had lain five hundred years and more but now have felt free wish for happier clime therefore thou feltst the mountain tremble and the spirits devout heardst over all his limits utter praise to that liege lord whom i entreat their joy to hasten thus he spake and since the draught is grateful ever as the thirst is keen no words may speak my fullness of content now said the instructor sage i see the net that takes ye here and how the toils are loosd why rocks the mountain and why ye rejoice vouchsafe that from thy lips i next may learn who on the earth thou wast and wherefore here so many an age wert prostratein that time when the good titus with heavns king to help avengd those piteous gashes whence the blood by judas sold did issue with the name most lasting and most honourd there was i abundantly renownd the shade replyd not yet with faith endued so passing sweet my vocal spirit from tolosa rome to herself drew me where i merited a myrtle garland to inwreathe my brow statius they name me still of thebes i sang and next of great achilles but i th way fell with the second burthen of my flame those sparkles were the seeds which i derivd from the bright fountain of celestial fire that feeds unnumberd lamps the song i mean which sounds aeneas wandrings that the breast i hung at that the nurse from whom my veins drank inspiration whose authority was ever sacred with me to have livd coeval with the mantuan i would bide the revolution of another sun beyond my stated years in banishment the mantuan when he heard him turnd to me and holding silence by his countenance enjoind me silence but the power which wills bears not supreme control laughter and tears follow so closely on the passion prompts them they wait not for the motions of the will in natures most sincere i did but smile as one who winks and thereupon the shade broke off and peerd into mine eyes where best our looks interpret so to good event mayst thou conduct such great emprize he cried say why across thy visage beamd but now the lightning of a smile on either part now am i straitend one conjures me speak th other to silence binds me whence a sigh i utter and the sigh is heard speak on the teacher cried and do not fear to speak but tell him what so earnestly he asks whereon i thus perchance o ancient spirit thou marvelst at my smiling there is room for yet more wonder he who guides my ken on high he is that mantuan led by whom thou didst presume of men and gods to sing if other cause thou deemdst for which i smild leave it as not the true one and believe those words thou spakst of him indeed the cause now down he bent t embrace my teachers feet but he forbade him brother do it not thou art a shadow and beholdst a shade he rising answerd thus now hast thou provd the force and ardour of the love i bear thee when i forget we are but things of air and as a substance treat an empty shade canto xxii now we had left the angel who had turnd to the sixth circle our ascending step one gash from off my forehead razd while they whose wishes tend to justice shouted forth blessed and ended with i thirst and i more nimble than along the other straits so journeyd that without the sense of toil i followd upward the swiftfooted shades when virgil thus began let its pure flame from virtue flow and love can never fail to warm anothers bosom so the light shine manifestly forth hence from that hour when mongst us in the purlieus of the deep came down the spirit of aquinums hard who told of thine affection my good will hath been for thee of quality as strong as ever linkd itself to one not seen therefore these stairs will now seem short to me but tell me and if too secure i loose the rein with a friends license as a friend forgive me and speak now as with a friend how chancd it covetous desire could find place in that bosom midst such ample store of wisdom as thy zeal had treasurd there first somewhat movd to laughter by his words statius replied each syllable of thine is a dear pledge of love things oft appear that minister false matters to our doubts when their true causes are removd from sight thy question doth assure me thou believst i was on earth a covetous man perhaps because thou foundst me in that circle placd know then i was too wide of avarice and een for that excess thousands of moons have waxd and wand upon my sufferings and were it not that i with heedful care noted where thou exclaimst as if in ire with human nature why thou cursed thirst of gold dost not with juster measure guide the appetite of mortals i had met the fierce encounter of the voluble rock then was i ware that with too ample wing the hands may haste to lavishment and turnd as from my other evil so from this in penitence how many from their grave shall with shorn locks arise who living aye and at lifes last extreme of this offence through ignorance did not repent and know the fault which lies direct from any sin in level opposition here with that wastes its green rankness on one common heap therefore if i have been with those who wail their avarice to cleanse me through reverse of their transgression such hath been my lot to whom the sovran of the pastoral song while thou didst sing that cruel warfare wagd by the twin sorrow of jocastas womb from thy discourse with clio there it seems as faith had not been shine without the which good deeds suffice not and if so what sun rose on thee or what candle piercd the dark that thou didst after see to hoist the sail and follow where the fisherman had led he answering thus by thee conducted first i enterd the parnassian grots and quaffd of the clear spring illumind first by thee opend mine eyes to god thou didst as one who journeying through the darkness hears a light behind that profits not himself but makes his followers wise when thou exclaimedst lo a renovated world justice returnd times of primeval innocence restord and a new race descended from above poet and christian both to thee i owed that thou mayst mark more clearly what i trace my hand shall stretch forth to inform the lines with livelier colouring soon oer all the world by messengers from heavn the true belief teemd now prolific and that word of thine accordant to the new instructors chimd inducd by which agreement i was wont resort to them and soon their sanctity so won upon me that domitians rage pursuing them i mixd my tears with theirs and while on earth i stayd still succourd them and their most righteous customs made me scorn all sects besides before i led the greeks in tuneful fiction to the streams of thebes i was baptizd but secretly through fear remaind a christian and conformd long time to pagan rites five centuries and more t for that lukewarmness was fain to pace round the fourth circle thou then who hast raisd the covering which did hide such blessing from me whilst much of this ascent is yet to climb say if thou know where our old terence bides caecilius plautus varro if condemnd they dwell and in what province of the deep these said my guide with persius and myself and others many more are with that greek of mortals the most cherishd by the nine in the first ward of darkness there ofttimes we of that mount hold converse on whose top for aye our nurses live we have

brink bend the right shoulder circuiting the mount as we have ever usd so custom there was usher to the road the which we chose less doubtful as that worthy shade complied they on before me went i sole pursued listning their speech that to my thoughts conveyd mysterious lessons of sweet poesy but soon they ceasd for midway of the road a tree we found with goodly fruitage hung and pleasant to the smell and as a fir upward from bough to bough less ample spreads so downward this less ample spread that none methinks aloft may climb upon the side that closd our path a liquid crystal fell from the steep rock and through the sprays above streamd showering with associate step the bards drew near the plant and from amidst the leaves a voice was heard ye shall be chary of me and after added

heard the more than father warn me son our time asks thriftier using linger not away thereat my face and steps at once i turnd toward the sages by whose converse cheerd i journeyd on and felt no toil

perchance their debt of duty pay as on their road the thoughtful pilgrims overtaking some not known unto them turn to them and look but stay not thus approaching from behind with speedier motion eyed

meagre erisicthon showd when pinced by sharpset famine to the quick lo to myself i musd the race who lost jerusalem when mary with dire beak preyd on her child the sockets seemd as rings from which the gems were drops who reads the name of man upon his forehead there the m had tracd most plainly who would deem that scent of water and an apple could have provd powerful to generate such pining want not knowing how it wrought while now i stood wondring what thus could waste them for the cause of their gaunt hollowness and scaly rind appeard not lo a spirit turnd his eyes in their deepsunken

we passd virtue possesses by th eternal will infusd the which so pines me every spirit whose song bewails his gluttony indulgd too grossly here in hunger and in thirst is purified the odour which the

swiftness on the last until a blow it strikes that leaveth him a corse most vilely shatterd no long space those wheels have yet to roll therewith his eyes lookd up to heavn ere thou shalt plainly see that which my words may not more plainly tell i quit thee time is precious here i lose too much thus measuring my pace with shine as from a troop of wellrankd chivalry one knight more enterprising than the rest pricks forth at gallop eager to display his prowess in the first encounter provd so parted he from us with lengthend strides and left me on the way with those twain spirits who were such mighty marshals of the world when he beyond us had so fled mine eyes no nearer reachd him than my thought his words the branches of another fruit thick hung and blooming fresh appeard een as our steps turnd thither not far off it rose to view beneath it were a multitude that raisd their hands and shouted forth i know not what unto the boughs like greedy and fond brats that beg and answer none obtain from him of whom they beg but more to draw them on he at arms length the object of their wish above them holds aloft and hides it not at length as undeceivd they went their way and we approach the tree who vows and tears sue to in vain the mighty tree pass on and come not near stands higher up the wood whereof eve tasted and from it was taen this plant such sounds from midst the thickets came whence i with either bard close to the side that rose passd forth beyond remember next we heard those noblest creatures of the clouds how they their twofold bosoms overgorgd opposd in fight to theseus call to mind the hebrews how effeminate they stoopd to ease their thirst whence gideons ranks were thinnd as he to midian marchd adown the hills thus near one border coasting still we heard the sins of gluttony with woe erewhile reguerdond then along the lonely path once more at large full thousand paces on we traveld each contemplative and mute why pensive journey thus ye three alone thus suddenly a voice exclaimd whereat i shook as doth a scard and paltry beast then raisd my head to look from whence it came was neer in furnace glass or metal seen so bright and glowing red as was the shape i now beheld if ye desire to mount he cried here must ye turn this way he goes who goes in quest of peace his countenance had dazzled me and to my guides i facd backward like one who walks as sound directs as when to harbinger the dawn springs up on freshend wing the air of may and breathes of fragrance all impregnd with herb and flowers een such a wind i felt upon my front blow gently and the moving of a wing perceivd that moving shed ambrosial smell and then a voice blessed are they whom grace doth so illume that appetite in them exhaleth no inordinate desire still hungring as the rule of temperance wills canto xxv it was an hour when he who climbs had need to walk uncrippled for the sun had now to taurus the meridian circle left and to the scorpion left the night as one that makes no pause but presses on his road whateer betide him if some urgent need impel so enterd we upon our way one before other for but singly none that steep and narrow scale admits to climb een as the young stork lifteth up his wing through wish to fly yet ventures not to quit the nest and drops it so in me desire of questioning my guide arose and fell arriving even to the act that marks a man prepard for speech him all our haste restraind not but thus spake the sire belovd fear not to speed the shaft that on thy lip stands trembling for its flight encouragd thus i straight began how there can leanness come where is no want of nourishment to feed if thou he answerd hadst rememberd thee how meleager with the wasting brand wasted alike by equal fires consumd this would not trouble thee and hadst thou thought how in the mirror your reflected form with mimic motion vibrates what now seems hard had appeard no harder than the pulp of summer fruit mature but that thy will in certainty may find its full repose lo statius here on him i call and pray that he would now be healer of thy wound if in thy presence i unfold to him the secrets of heavens vengeance let me plead thine own injunction to exculpate me so statius answerd and forthwith began attend my words o son and in thy mind receive them so shall they be light to clear the doubt thou offerst blood concocted well which by the thirsty veins is neer imbibd and rests as food superfluous to be taen from the replenishd table in the heart derives effectual virtue that informs the several human limbs as being that which passes through the veins itself to make them yet more concocted it descends where shame forbids to mention and from thence distils in natural vessel on anothers blood then each unite together one disposd t endure to act the other through meet frame of its recipient mould that being reachd it gins to work coagulating first then vivifies what its own substance causd to bear with animation now indued the active virtue differing from a plant no further than that this is on the way and at its limit that continues yet to operate that now it moves and feels as sea sponge clinging to the rock

and imbreathes new spirit replete with virtue that what here active it finds to its own substance draws and forms an individual soul that lives and feels and bends reflective on itself and that thou less mayst marvel at the word mark the suns heat how that to wine doth change mixd with the moisture filterd through the vine when lachesis hath spun the thread the soul takes with her both the human

refracting decks itself with many a hue so here the ambient air weareth that form which influence of the soul imprints on it and like the flame that where the fire moves thither follows so henceforth the new form on the spirit follows still hence hath it semblance and is shadow calld with each sense even to the sight endued hence speech is ours hence laughter tears and sighs which thou mayst oft have witnessd on the mount th obedient shadow fails not to present whatever varying passion moves within us and this the cause of what thou marvelst at now the last flexure of our way we reachd and to the right hand turning other care awaits us here the rocky precipice hurls forth redundant flames and from the rim a blast upblown with forcible rebuff driveth them back sequesterd from its bound behoovd us one by one along the side that borderd on the void to pass and i feard on one hand the fire on th other feard headlong to fall when thus th instructor warnd strict rein must in this place direct the eyes a little swerving and the way is lost then from the bosom of the burning mass o god of mercy heard i sung and felt no less desire to turn and when i saw spirits along the flame proceeding i between their footsteps and mine own was fain to share by turns my view at the hymns close they shouted loud i do not know a man then in low voice again took up the strain which once more ended to the wood they cried ran dian and drave forth callisto stung with cythereas poison then returnd unto their song then marry a pair extolld who livd in virtue chastely and the bands of wedded

the umberd flame burn ruddier at so strange a sight i markd that many a spirit marveld on his way this bred occasion first to speak of me he seems said they no insubstantial frame then to obtain what certainty they might stretchd towards me careful not to overpass the burning pale o thou who followest the others haply not more slow than they but movd by revrence answer me who burn in thirst and fire nor i alone but these all for thine answer do more thirst than doth indian or aethiop for the cooling stream tell us how is it that thou makst thyself a wall against the sun as thou not yet into th inextricable toils of death hadst enterd thus spake one and i had straight declard me if attention had not turnd to new appearance meeting these there came midway the burning path a crowd on whom earnestly gazing from each part i view the shadows all press forward sevrally each snatch a hasty kiss and then away een so the emmets mid their dusky troops peer closely one at other to spy out their mutual road perchance and how they thrive that friendly greeting parted ere dispatch of the first onward step from either tribe loud clamour rises those who newly come shout sodom and gomorrah these the cow pasiphae enterd that the beast she wood might rush unto her luxury then as cranes that part towards the riphaean mountains fly part towards the lybic sands these to avoid the ice and those the sun so hasteth off one crowd advances th other and resume their first song weeping and their several shout again drew near my side the very same who had erewhile besought me and their looks markd eagerness to listen i who twice their will had noted spake o spirits secure wheneer the time may be of peaceful end my limbs nor crude nor in mature old age have i left yonder here they bear me fed with blood and sinewstrung that i no more may live in blindness hence i tend aloft there is a dame on high who wind for us this grace by which my mortal through your realm i bear but may your utmost wish soon meet such full fruition that the orb of heaven fullest of love and of most ample space receive you as ye tell upon my page henceforth to stand recorded who ye are and what this multitude that at your backs have past behind us as one mountainbred rugged and clownish if some citys walls he chance to enter round him stares agape confounded and struck dumb een such appeard each spirit but when rid of that amaze not long the inmate of a noble heart he who before had questiond thus resumd o blessed who for death preparing takst experience of our limits in thy bark their crime who not with us proceed was that for which as he did triumph caesar heard the snout of queen to taunt him hence their cry of sodom as they parted to rebuke themselves and aid the burning by their shame our sinning was hermaphrodite but we because the law of human kind we broke following like beasts our vile concupiscence hence parting from them to our own disgrace record the name of her by whom the beast in bestial tire was acted now our deeds thou knowst and how we sinnd if thou by name wouldst haply know us time permits not now to tell so much nor can i of myself learn what thou wishest guinicelli i who having truly sorrowd ere my last already cleanse me with such pious joy as the two sons upon their mother gazd from sad lycurgus rescud such my joy save that i more represt it when i heard from his own lips the name of him pronouncd who was a father to me and to those my betters who have ever usd the sweet and pleasant rhymes of love so nought i heard nor spake but long time thoughtfully i went gazing on him and only for the fire approachd not nearer when my eyes were fed by looking on him with such solemn pledge as forces credence i devoted me unto his service wholly in reply he thus bespake me what from thee i hear is gravd so deeply on my mind the waves of lethe shall not wash it off nor make a whit less lively but as now thy oath has seald the truth declare what cause impels that love which both thy looks and speech bewray those dulcet lays i answerd which as long as of our tongue the beauty does not fade shall make us love the very ink that tracd them brother he cried and pointed at a shade before him there is one whose mother speech doth owe to him a fairer ornament he in love ditties and the tales of prose without a rival stands and lets the fools talk on who think the songster of limoges oertops him rumour and the popular voice they look to more than truth and so confirm opinion ere by art or reason taught thus many of the elder time cried up guittone giving him the prize till truth by strength of numbers vanquishd if thou own so ample privilege as to have gaind free entrance to the cloister whereof christ is abbot of the college say to him one paternoster for me far as needs for dwellers in this world where power to sin no longer tempts us haply to make way for one that followd next when that was said he vanishd through the fire as through the wave a fish that glances diving to the deep i to the spirit he had shown me drew a little onward and besought his name for which my heart i said kept gracious room he frankly thus began thy courtesy so wins on me i have nor power nor will to hide me i am arnault and with songs sorely lamenting for my folly past thorough this ford of fire i wade and see the day i hope for smiling in my view i pray ye by the worth that guides ye up unto the summit of the scale in time remember ye my suffrings with such words he disappeard in the refining flame canto xxvii now was the sun so stationd as when first his early radiance quivers on the heights where streamd his makers blood while libra hangs above hesperian ebro and new fires meridian flash on ganges yellow tide so day was sinking when the angel of god appeard before us joy was in his mien forth of the flame he stood upon the brink and with a voice whose lively clearness far surpassd our human blessed are the pure in heart he sang then near him as we came go ye not further holy spirits he cried ere the fire pierce you enter in and list attentive to the song ye hear from thence i when i heard his saying was as one laid in the grave my hands together claspd and upward stretching on the fire i lookd and busy fancy conjurd up the forms erewhile beheld alive consumd in flames th escorting spirits turnd with gentle looks toward me and the mantuan spake my son here torment thou mayst feel but canst not death remember thee remember thee if i safe een on geryon brought thee now i come more near to god wilt thou not trust me now of this be sure though in its womb that flame a thousand years containd thee from thy head no hair should perish if thou doubt my truth approach and with thy hands thy vestures hem stretch forth and for thyself confirm belief lay now all fear o lay all fear aside turn hither and come onward undismayd i still though conscience urgd no step advancd when still he saw me fixd and obstinate somewhat disturbd he cried mark now my son from beatrice thou art by this wall divided as at thisbes name the eye of pyramus was opend when life ebbd fast from his veins and took one parting glance while vermeil dyed the mulberry thus i turnd to my sage guide relenting when i heard the name that springs forever in my breast he shook his forehead and how long he said linger we now then smild as one would smile upon a child that eyes the fruit and yields into the fire before me then he walkd and statius who erewhile no little space had parted us he prayd to come behind i would have cast me into molten glass to cool me when i enterd so intense ragd the conflagrant mass the sire belovd to comfort me as he proceeded still of beatrice talkd her eyes saith he een now i seem to view from the other side a voice that sang did guide us and the voice following with heedful ear we issued forth there where the path led upward come we heard come blessed of my father such the sounds that haild us from within a light which shone so radiant i could not endure the view the sun it added hastes and evening comes delay not ere the western sky is hung with blackness strive ye for the pass our way upright within the rock arose and facd such part of heavn that from before my steps the beams were shrouded of the sinking sun nor many stairs were overpass when now by fading of the shadow we perceivd the sun behind us couchd and ere one face of darkness oer its measureless expanse involvd th horizon and the night her lot held individual each of us had made a stair his pallet not that will but power had faild us by the nature of that mount forbidden further travel as the goats that late have skippd and wantond rapidly upon the craggy cliffs ere they had taen their supper on the herb now silent lie and ruminate beneath the umbrage brown while noonday rages and the goatherd leans upon his staff and leaning watches them and as the swain that lodges out all night in quiet by his flock lest beast of prey disperse them even so all three abode i as a goat and as the shepherds they close pent on either side by shelving rock a little glimpse of sky was seen above yet by that little i beheld the stars in magnitude and rustle shining forth with more than wonted glory as i lay gazing on them and in that fit of musing sleep overcame me sleep that bringeth oft tidings of future hap about the hour as i believe when venus from the east first lightend on the mountain she whose orb seems always glowing with the fire of love a lady young and beautiful i dreamd was passing oer a lea and as she came methought i saw her ever and anon bending to cull the flowers and thus she sang know ye whoever of my name would ask that i am leah for my brow to weave a garland these fair hands unwearied ply to please me at the crystal mirror here i deck me but my sister rachel she before her glass abides the livelong day her radiant eyes beholding charmd no less than i with this delightful task her joy in contemplation as in labour mine and now as glimmring dawn appeard that breaks more welcome to the pilgrim still as he sojourns less distant on his homeward way darkness from all sides fled and with it fled my slumber whence i rose and saw my guide already risen that delicious fruit which through so many a branch the zealous care of mortals roams in quest of shall this day appease thy hunger such the words i heard from virgils lip and never greeting heard so pleasant as the sounds within me straight desire so grew upon desire to mount thenceforward at each step i felt the wings increasing for my flight when we had run oer all the ladder to its topmost round as there we stood on me the mantuan fixd his eyes and thus he spake both fires my son the temporal and eternal thou hast seen and art arrivd where of itself my ken no further reaches i with skill and art thus far have drawn thee now thy pleasure take for guide thou hast oercome the steeper way oercome the straighter lo the sun that darts his beam upon thy forehead lo the herb the arboreta and flowers which of itself this land pours forth profuse till those bright eyes with gladness come which weeping made me haste to succour thee thou mayst or seat thee down or wander where thou wilt expect no more sanction of warning voice or sign from me free of thy own arbitrement to choose discreet judicious to distrust thy sense were henceforth error i invest thee then with crown and mitre sovereign oer thyself canto xxviii through that celestial forest whose thick shade with lively greenness the newspringing day attemperd eager now to roam and search its limits round forthwith i left the bank along the champain leisurely my way pursuing oer the ground that on all sides delicious odour breathd a pleasant air that intermitted never never veerd smote on my temples gently as a wind of softest influence at which the sprays obedient all leand trembling to that part where first the holy mountain casts his shade yet were not so disorderd but that still upon their top the featherd quiristers applied their wonted art and with full joy welcomd those hours of prime and warbled shrill amid the leaves that to their jocund lays inept tenor even as from branch to branch along the piney forests on the shore of chiassi rolls the gathring melody when eolus hath from his cavern loosd the dripping south already had my steps though slow so far into that ancient wood transported me i could not ken the place where i had enterd when behold my path was bounded by a rill which to the left with little rippling waters bent the grass that issued from its brink on earth no wave how clean soeer that would not seem to have some mixture in itself compard with this transpicuous clear yet darkly on it rolld darkly beneath perpetual gloom which neer admits or sun or moon light there to shine my feet advancd not but my wondring eyes passd onward oer the streamlet to survey the tender maybloom flushd through many a hue in prodigal variety and there as object rising suddenly to view that from our bosom every thought beside with the rare marvel chases i beheld a lady all alone who singing went and culling flower from flower wherewith her way was all oer painted lady beautiful thou who if looks that use to speak the heart are worthy of our trust with loves own beam dost warm thee thus to her my speech i framd ah please thee hither towards the streamlet bend thy steps so near that i may list thy song beholding thee and this fair place methinks i call to mind where wanderd and how lookd proserpine in that season when her child the mother lost and she the bloomy spring as when a lady turning in the dance doth foot it featly and advances scarce one step before the other to the ground over the yellow and vermilion flowers thus turnd she at my suit most maidenlike valing her sober eyes and came so near that i distinctly caught the dulcet sound arriving where the limped waters now lavd the green sward her eyes she deignd to raise that shot such splendour on me as i ween neer glanced from cythereas when her son had sped his keenest weapon to her heart upon the opposite bank she stood and smild through her graceful fingers shifted still the intermingling dyes which without seed that lofty land unbosoms by the stream three paces only were we sunderd yet the hellespont where xerxes passd it oer a curb for ever to the pride of man was by leander not more hateful held for floating with inhospitable wave twixt sestus and abydos than by me that flood because it gave no passage thence strangers ye come and haply in this place that cradled human nature in its birth wondring ye not without suspicion view my smiles but that sweet strain of psalmody thou lord hast made me glad will give ye light which may uncloud your minds and thou who standst the foremost and didst make thy suit to me say if aught else thou wish to hear for i came prompt to answer every doubt of thine she spake and i replied i know not how to reconcile this wave and rustling sound of forest leaves with what i late have heard of opposite report she answering thus i will unfold the cause whence that proceeds which makes thee wonder and so purge the cloud that hath enwraps thee the first good whose joy is only in himself created man for happiness and gave this goodly place his

to the lovely dame canto xxix singing as if enamourd she resumd and closd the song with blessed they whose sins are coverd like the woodnymphs then that trippd singly across the sylvan shadows one eager to view and one to scape the sun so movd she on against the current up the verdant rivage i her mincing step observing with as tardy step pursued between us not an hundred paces trod the bank on each side bending equally gave me to face the orient nor our way far onward brought us when to me at once she turnd and cried my brother look and hearken and lo a sudden lustre ran across through the great forest on all parts so bright i doubted whether lightning were abroad but that expiring ever in the spleen that doth unfold it and this during still and waxing still in splendor made me question what it might be and a sweet melody ran through the luminous air then did i chide with warrantable zeal the hardihood of our first parent for that there were earth stood in obedience to the heavns she only woman the creature of an hour endurd not restraint of any veil which had she borne devoutly joys ineffable as these had from the first and long time since been mine while through that wilderness

that the bride would have outstript them on her bridal day the lady called aloud why thus yet burns affection in thee for these living lights and dost not look on that which follows them i straightway markd a tribe behind them walk as if attendant on their leaders clothd with raiment of such whiteness as on earth was never on my left the watry gleam borrowd and gave me back when there i lookd as in a mirror my left side portrayd when i had chosen on the rivers edge such station that the distance of the stream alone did separate me there i stayd my steps for clearer prospect and beheld the flames

eastern clime all roseate and the sky opposd one deep and beautiful serene and the suns face so shaded and with mists attemperd at lids rising that the eye long while endurd the sight thus in a cloud of flowers that from those hands angelic rose and down within and outside of the car fell showering in white veil with olive wreathd a virgin in my view appeard beneath green mantle robd in hue of living flame and oer my spirit that in former days within her presence had abode so long no shuddring terror crept mine eyes no more had knowledge of her yet there movd from her a hidden virtue at

espying recoild and sought the greensward such a weight of shame was on my forehead with a mien of that stern majesty which doth surround mothers presence to her awestruck child she lookd a flavour of such bitterness was mingled in her pity there her words brake off and suddenly the angels sang in thee o gracious lord my hope hath been but went no farther than thou lord hast set my feet in ample

anguish forth gushd through the lips and eyelids from the heart upon the chariots right edge still she stood immovable and thus addressd her words to those bright semblances with pity touchd ye in th eternal day your vigils keep so that nor night nor slumber with close stealth conveys from you a single step in all the goings on of life thence with more heed i shape mine answer for his ear intended who there stands weeping that the sorrow now may equal the transgression not alone through operation of the mighty orbs that mark each seed to some predestind aim as with aspect or fortunate or ill the constellations meet but through benign largess of heavnly graces which rain down from such a height as mocks our vision this man was in the freshness of his being such so gifted virtually that in him all better habits wondrously had thrivd the more of kindly strength is in the soil so much doth evil seed and lack of culture mar it the more and make it run to wildness these looks sometime upheld him for i showd my youthful eyes and led him by their light in upright walking soon as i had reachd the threshold of my second age and changd my mortal for immortal then he left me and gave himself to others when from flesh to spirit i had risen and increase of beauty and of virtue circled me i was less dear to him and valued less his steps were turnd into deceitful ways following false images of good that make no promise perfect nor availd me aught to sue for inspirations with the which i both in dreams of night and otherwise did call him back of them so little reckd him such depth he fell that all device was short of his preserving save that he should view the children of perdition to this end i visited the purlieus of the dead and one who hath conducted him thus high receivd my supplications urgd with weeping it were a breaking of gods high decree if lethe should be past and such food tasted without the cost of some repentant tear canto xxxi o thou her words she thus without delay resuming turnd their point on me to whom they but with lateral edge seemd harsh before say thou who standst beyond the holy stream if this be true a charge so grievous needs thine own avowal on my faculty such strange amazement hung the voice expird imperfect ere its organs gave it birth a little space refraining then she spake what dost thou muse on answer me the wave on thy remembrances of evil yet hath done no injury a mingled sense of fear and of confusion from my lips did such a yea produce as needed help of vision to interpret as when breaks in act to be dischargd a crossbow bent beyond its pitch both nerve and bow oerstretchd the flagging weapon feebly hits the mark thus tears and sighs forth gushing did i burst beneath the heavy load and thus my voice was slackend on its way she straight began when my desire invited thee to love the good which sets a bound to our aspirings what bar of thwarting foss or linked chain did meet thee that thou so shouldst quit the hope of further progress or what bait of ease or promise of allurement led thee on elsewhere that thou elsewhere shouldst rather wait a bitter sigh i drew then scarce found voice to answer hardly to these sounds my lips gave utterance wailing thy fair looks withdrawn things present with deceitful pleasures turnd my steps aside she answering spake hadst thou been silent or denied what thou avowst thou hadst not hid thy sin the more such eye observes it but wheneer the sinners cheek breaks forth into the preciousstreaming tears of selfaccusing in our court the wheel of justice doth run counter to the edge howeer that thou mayst profit by thy shame for errors past and that henceforth more strength may arm thee when thou hearst the sirenvoice lay thou aside the motive to this grief and lend attentive ear while i unfold how opposite a way my buried flesh should have impelld thee never didst thou spy in art or nature aught so passing sweet as were the limbs that in their beauteous frame enclosd me and are scatterd now in dust if sweetest thing thus faild thee with my death what afterward of mortal should thy wish have tempted when thou first hadst felt the dart of perishable things in my departing for better realms thy wing thou shouldst have prund to follow me and never stoopd again to bide a second blow for a slight girl or other gaud as transient and as vain the new and inexperiencd bird awaits twice it may be or thrice the fowlers aim but in the sight of one whose plumes are full in vain the net is spread the arrow wingd i stood as children silent and ashamd stand listning with their eyes upon the earth acknowledging their fault and selfcondemnd and she resumd if but to hear thus pains thee raise thou thy beard and lo what sight shall do with less reluctance yields a sturdy holm rent from its fibers by a blast that blows from off the pole or from iarbas land than i at her behest my visage raisd and thus the face denoting by the beard i markd the secret sting her words conveyd no sooner lifted i mine aspect up than downward sunk that vision i beheld of goodly creatures vanish and mine eyes yet unassurd and wavering bent their light on beatrice towards the animal who joins two natures in one form she turnd and even under shadow of her veil and parted by the verdant rill that flowd between in loveliness appeard as much her former self surpassing as on earth all others she surpassd remorseful goads shot sudden through me each thing else the more its love had late beguild me now the more i was loathsome on my heart so keenly smote the bitter consciousness that on the ground oerpowerd i fell and what my state was then she knows who was the cause when now my strength flowd back returning outward from the heart the lady whom alone i first had seen i found above me loose me not she cried loose not thy hold and lo had draggd me high as to my neck into the stream while she still as she drew me after swept along swift as a shuttle bounding oer the wave the blessed shore approaching then was heard so sweetly tu asperges me that i may not remember much less tell the sound the beauteous dame her arms expanding claspd my temples and immergd me where t was fit the wave should drench me and thence raising up within the fourfold dance of lovely nymphs presented me so lavd and with their arm they each did cover me here are we nymphs and in the heavn are stars or ever earth was visited of beatrice we appointed for her handmaids tended on her we to her eyes will lead thee but the light of gladness that is in them well to scan those yonder three of deeper ken than ours thy sight shall quicken thus began their song and then they led me to the gryphons breast while turnd toward us beatrice stood spare not thy vision we have stationed thee before the emeralds whence love erewhile hath drawn his weapons on thee as they spake a thousand fervent wishes riveted mine eyes upon her beaming eyes that stood still fixd toward the gryphon motionless as the sun strikes a mirror even thus within those orbs the twofold being shone for ever varying in one figure now reflected now in other reader muse how wondrous in my sight it seemd to mark a thing albeit steadfast in itself yet in its imagd semblance mutable full of amaze and joyous while my soul fed on the viand whereof still desire grows with satiety the other three with gesture that declard a loftier line advancd to their own carol on they came dancing in festive ring angelical turn beatrice was their song o turn thy saintly sight on this thy faithful one who to behold thee many a wearisome pace hath measurd gracious at our prayr vouchsafe unveil to him thy cheeks that he may mark thy second beauty now conceald o splendour o sacred light eternal who is he so pale with musing in pierian shades or with that fount so lavishly imbued whose spirit should not fail him in th essay to represent thee such as thou didst seem when under cope of the stillchiming heaven thou gavst to open air thy charms reveald canto xxxii mine eyes with such an eager coveting were bent to rid them of their ten years thirst no other sense was waking and een they were fencd on either side from heed of aught so tangled in its customd toils that smile of saintly brightness drew me to itself when forcibly toward the left my sight the sacred virgins turnd for from their lips i heard the warning sounds too fixd a gaze awhile my vision labord as when late upon the oerstrained eyes the sun hath smote but soon to lesser object as the view was now recoverd lesser in respect to that excess of sensible whence late i had perforce been sunderd on their right i markd that glorious army wheel and turn against the sun and sevnfold lights their front as when their bucklers for protection raisd a wellrangd troop with portly banners curld wheel circling ere the whole can change their ground een thus the goodly regiment of heavn proceeding all did pass us ere the car had slopd his beam attendant at the wheels the damsels turnd and on the gryphon movd the sacred burden with a pace so smooth no feather on him trembled the fair dame who through the wave had drawn me companied by statius and myself pursued the wheel whose orbit rolling markd a lesser arch through the high wood now void the more her blame who by the serpent was beguild i past with step in cadence to the harmony angelic onward had we movd as far perchance as arrow at three several flights full wingd had sped when from her station down descended beatrice with one voice all murmurd adam circling next a plant despoild of flowers and leaf on every bough its tresses spreading more as more they rose were such as midst their forest wilds for height the indians might have gazd at blessed thou gryphon whose beak hath never pluckd that tree pleasant to taste for hence the appetite was warpd to evil round the stately trunk thus shouted forth the rest to whom returnd the animal twicegenderd yea for so the generation of the just are savd and turning to the chariotpole to foot he drew it of the widowd branch and bound there left unto the stock whereon it grew as when large floods of radiance from above stream with that radiance mingled which ascends next after setting of the scaly sign our plants then burgeon and each wears anew his wonted colours ere the sun have yokd beneath another star his flamy steeds thus putting forth a hue more faint than rose and deeper than the violet was renewd the plant erewhile in all its branches bare unearthly was the hymn which then arose i understood it not nor to the end endurd the harmony had i the skill to pencil forth how closd th unpitying eyes slumbring when syrinx warbled eyes that paid so dearly for their watching then like painter that with a model paints i might design the manner of my falling into sleep but feign who will the slumber cunningly i pass it by to when i wakd and tell how suddenly a flash of splendour rent the curtain of my sleep and one cries out arise what dost thou as the chosen three on tabors mount admitted to behold the blossoming of that fair tree whose fruit is coveted of angels and doth make perpetual feast in heaven to themselves returning at the word whence deeper sleeps were broken that they their tribe diminishd saw both moses and elias gone and changd the stole their master wore thus to myself returning over me beheld i stand the piteous one who cross the stream had brought my steps and where all doubting i exclaimd is beatricesee her she replied beneath the fresh leaf seated on its root behold th associate choir that circles her the others with a melody more sweet and more profound journeying to higher realms upon the gryphon tend if there her words were closd i know not but mine eyes had now taen view of her by whom all other thoughts were barrd admittance on the very ground alone she sat as she had there been left a guard upon the wain which i beheld bound to the twyform beast the seven nymphs did make themselves a cloister round about her and in their hands upheld those lights secure from blast septentrion and the gusty south a little while thou shalt be forester here and citizen shalt be forever with me of that true rome wherein christ dwells a roman to profit the misguided world keep now thine eyes upon the car and what thou seest take heed thou write returning to that place thus beatrice at whose feet inclind devout at her behest my thought and eyes i as she bade directed never fire with so swift motion forth a stormy cloud leapd downward from the welkins farthest bound as i beheld the bird of jove descending pounce on the tree and as he rushd the rind disparting crush beneath him buds much more and leaflets on the car with all his might he struck whence staggering like a ship it reeld at random drivn to starboard now oercome and now to larboard by the vaulting waves next springing up into the chariots womb a fox i saw with hunger seeming pind of all good food but for his ugly sins the saintly maid rebuking him away scampring he turnd fast as his hidebound corpse would bear him next from whence before he came i saw the eagle dart into the hull o th car and leave it with his feathers lind and then a voice like that which issues forth from heart with sorrow rivd did issue forth from heavn and o poor bark of mine it cried how badly art thou freighted then it seemd that the earth opend between either wheel and i beheld a dragon issue thence that through the chariot fixd his forked train and like a wasp that draggeth back the sting so drawing forth his baleful train he draggd part of the bottom forth and went his way exulting what remaind as lively turf with green herb so did clothe itself with plumes which haply had with purpose chaste and kind been offerd and therewith were clothd the wheels both one and other and the beam so quickly a sigh were not breathd sooner thus transformd the holy structure through its several parts did put forth heads three on the beam and one on every side the first like oxen hornd but with a single horn upon their front the four like monster sight hath never seen oer it methought there sat secure as rock on mountains lofty top a shameless whore whose ken rovd loosely round her at her side as t were that none might bear her off i saw a giant stand and ever and anon they mingled kisses but her lustful eyes chancing on me to wander that fell minion scourgd her from head to foot all oer then full of jealousy and fierce with rage unloosd the monster and draggd on so far across the forest that from me its shades alone shielded the harlot and the newformd brute canto xxxiii the heathen lord are come responsive thus the trinal now and now the virgin band quaternion their sweet psalmody began weeping and beatrice listend sad and sighing to the song in such a mood that mary as she stood beside the cross was scarce more changd but when they gave her place to speak then risen upright on her feet she with a colour glowing bright as fire did answer yet a little while and ye shall see me not and my beloved sisters again a little while and ye shall see me before her then she marshalld all the seven and beckning only motiond me the dame and that remaining sage to follow her so on she passd and had not set i ween her tenth step to the ground when with mine eyes her eyes encounterd and with visage mild so mend thy pace she cried that if my words address thee thou mayst still be aptly placd to hear them soon as duly to her side i now had hastend brother she began why makst thou no attempt at questioning as thus we walk together like to those who speaking with too reverent an awe before their betters draw not forth the voice alive unto their lips befell me shell that i in sounds imperfect thus began lady what i have need of that thou knowst and what will suit my need she answering thus of fearfulness and shame i will that thou henceforth do rid thee that thou speak no more as one who dreams thus far be taught of me the vessel which thou sawst the serpent break was and is not let him who hath the blame hope not to scare gods vengeance with a sop without an heir for ever shall not be that eagle he who left the chariot plumd which monster made it first and next a prey plainly i view and therefore speak the stars een now approaching whose conjunction free from all impediment and bar brings on a season in the which one sent from god five hundred five and ten do mark him out that foul one and th accomplice of her guilt the giant both shall slay and if perchance my saying dark as themis or as sphinx fail to persuade thee since like them it foils the intellect with blindness yet ere long events shall be the naiads that will solve this knotty riddle and no damage light on flock or field take heed and as these words by me are utterd teach them even so to those who live that life which is a race to death and when thou writst them keep in mind not to conceal how thou hast seen the plant that twice hath now been spoild this whoso robs this whoso plucks with blasphemy of deed sins against god who for his use alone creating hallowd it for taste of this in pain and in desire five thousand years and upward the first soul did yearn for him who punishd in himself the fatal gust thy reason slumbers if it deem this height and summit thus inverted of the plant without due cause and were not vainer thoughts as elsas numbing waters to thy soul and their fond pleasures had not dyed it dark as pyramus the mulberry thou hadst seen in such momentous circumstance alone gods equal justice morally implied in the forbidden tree but since i mark thee in understanding hardend into stone and to that hardness spotted too and staind so that thine eye is dazzled at my word i will that if not written yet at least painted thou take it in thee for the cause that one brings home his staff inwreathd with palm i thus as wax

his triumph gathers thence a wreath caesar or bard more shame for human wills depravd joy to the delphic god must spring from the pierian foliage when one breast is with such thirst inspird from a

through that which joins four circles with the threefold cross in best course and in happiest constellation set he comes and to the worldly wax best gives its temper and impression morning there here eve was by almost such passage made and whiteness had oerspread that hemisphere blackness the other part when to the left i saw beatrice turnd and on the sun gazing as never eagle fixd his ken as from the first a second beam is wont to issue and reflected upwards rise een as a pilgrim bent on his return so of her act that through the eyesight passd into my fancy mine was formd and straight beyond our mortal wont i fixd mine eyes upon the sun much is allowed us there that here exceeds our powr thanks to the place made for the dwelling of the human kind i sufferd it not long and yet so long that i beheld it bickring sparks around as iron that comes boiling from the fire and suddenly upon the day appeard a day newrisn as he who hath the power had with another sun bedeckd the sky her eyes fast fixd on the eternal wheels beatrice stood unmovd and i with ken fixd upon her from upward gaze removd at her aspect such inwardly became as glaucus when he tasted of the herb that made him peer among the ocean gods words may not tell of that transhuman change and therefore let the example serve though weak for those whom grace hath better proof in store if i were only what thou didst create then newly love by whom the heavn is ruld thou knowst who by thy light didst bear me up whenas the wheel which thou dost ever guide desired spirit with its harmony temperd of thee and measurd charmd mine ear then seemd to me so much of heavn to blaze with the suns flame that rain or flood neer made a lake so broad the newness of the sound and that great light inflamd me with desire keener than eer was felt to know their cause whence she who saw me clearly as myself to calm my troubled mind before i askd opend her lips and gracious thus began with false imagination thou thyself makst dull so that thou seest not the thing which thou hadst seen had that been shaken off thou art not on the earth as thou believst for lightning scapd from its own proper place neer ran as thou hast hither now returnd although divested of my firstraisd doubt by those brief words accompanied with smiles yet in new doubt was i entangled more and said already satisfied i rest from admiration deep but now admire how i above those lighter bodies rise whence after uttrance of a piteous sigh she towrds me bent her eyes with such a look as on her frenzied child a mother casts then thus began among themselves all things have order and from hence the form which makes the universe resemble god in this the higher creatures see the printed steps of that eternal worth which is the end whither the line is drawn all natures lean in this their order diversely some more some less approaching to their primal source thus they to different havens are movd on through the vast sea of being and each one with instinct givn that bears it in its course this to the lunar sphere directs the fire this prompts the hearts of mortal animals this the brute earth together knits and binds nor only creatures void of intellect are aimd at by this bow but even those that have intelligence and love are piercd that providence who so well orders all with her own light makes ever calm the heaven in which the substance that hath greatest speed is turnd and thither now as to our seat predestind we are carried by the force of that strong cord that never looses dart but at fair aim and glad yet is it true that as ofttimes but ill accords the form to the design of art through sluggishness of unreplying matter so this course is sometimes quitted by the creature who hath power directed thus to bend elsewhere as from a cloud the fire is seen to fall from its original impulse warpd to earth by vicious fondness thou no more admire thy soaring if i rightly deem than lapse of torrent downwards from a mountains height there would in thee for wonder be more cause if free of hindrance thou hadst fixd thyself below like fire unmoving on the earth so said she turnd toward the heavn her face canto ii

reveal ye other few who have outstretchd the neck timely for food of angels on which here they live yet never know satiety through the deep brine ye fearless may put out your vessel marking well the

thirst that draws toward the realm of gods own form bore us swift almost as the heaven ye behold beatrice upward gazd and i on her and in such space as on the notch a dart is placd then loosend flies i saw myself arrivd where wondrous thing engagd my sight whence she to whom no work of mine was hid turning to me with aspect glad as fair bespake me gratefully direct thy mind to god through whom to this first star we come me seemd as if a cloud had coverd us translucent solid firm and polishd bright like adamant which the suns beam had smit within itself the everduring pearl receivd us as the wave a ray of light receives and rests unbroken if i then was of corporeal frame and it transcend our weaker thought how one dimension thus another could endure which needs must be if body enter body how much more must the desire inflame us to behold that essence which discovers by what means god and our nature joind there will be seen that which we hold through faith not shown by proof but in itself intelligibly plain een as the truth that man at first believes i answered lady i with thoughts devout such as i best can frame give thanks to him who hath removd me from the mortal world but tell i pray thee whence the gloomy spots upon this body which below on earth give rise to talk of cain in fabling quaint she somewhat smild then spake if mortals err in their opinion when the key of sense unlocks not surely wonders weapon keen ought not to pierce thee since thou findst the wings of reason to pursue the senses flight are short but what thy own thought is declare then i what various here above appears is causd i deem by bodies dense or rare she then resumd thou certainly wilt see in falsehood thy belief oerwhelmd if well thou listen to the arguments which i shall bring to face it the eighth sphere displays numberless lights the which in kind and size may be remarkd of different aspects if rare or dense of that were cause alone one single virtue then would be in all alike distributed or more or less different virtues needs must be the fruits of formal principles and these save one will by thy reasoning be destroyd beside if rarity were of that dusk the cause which thou inquirest either in some part that planet must throughout be void nor fed with its own matter or as bodies share their fat and leanness in like manner this must in its volume change the leaves the first if it were true had through the suns eclipse been manifested by transparency of light as through aught rare beside effusd but this is not therefore remains to see the other cause and if the other fall erroneous so must prove what seemd to thee if not from side to side this rarity pass through there needs must be a limit whence its contrary no further lets it pass and hence the beam that from without proceeds must be pourd back as colour comes through glass reflected which behind it lead conceals now wilt thou say that there of murkier hue than in the other part the ray is shown by being thence refracted farther back from this perplexity will free thee soon experience if thereof thou trial make the fountain whence your arts derive their streame three mirrors shalt thou take and two remove from thee alike and more remote the third betwixt the former pair shall meet thine eyes then turnd toward them cause behind thy back a light to stand that on the three shall shine and thus reflected come to thee from all though that beheld most distant do not stretch a space so ample yet in brightness thou will own it equaling the rest but now as under snow the ground if the warm ray smites it remains dismantled of the hue and cold that coverd it before so thee dismantled in thy mind i will inform with light so lively that the tremulous beam shall quiver where it falls within the heaven where peace divine inhabits circles round a body in whose virtue dies the being of all that it contains the following heaven that hath so many lights this being divides through different essences from it distinct and yet containd within it the other orbs their separate distinctions variously dispose for their own seed and produce apt thus do these organs of the world proceed as thou beholdest now from step to step their influences from above deriving and thence transmitting downwards mark me well how through this passage to the truth i ford the truth thou lovst that thou henceforth alone mayst know to keep the shallows safe untold the virtue and motion of the sacred orbs as mallet by the workmans hand must needs by blessed movers be inspird this heaven made beauteous by so many luminaries from the deep spirit that moves its circling sphere its image takes an impress as a seal and as the soul that dwells within your dust through members different yet together formd in different powrs resolves itself een so the intellectual efficacy unfolds its goodness multiplied throughout the stars on its own unity revolving still different virtue compact different makes with the precious body it enlivens with which it knits as life in you is knit from its original nature full of joy the virtue mingled through the body shines as joy through pupil of the living eye from hence proceeds that which from light to light seems different and not from dense or rare this is the formal cause that generates proportiond to its power the dusk or clear canto iii that sun which erst with love my bosom warmd had of fair truth unveild the sweet aspect by proof of right and of the false reproof and i to own myself convincd and free of doubt as much as needed raisd my head erect for speech but soon a sight appeard which so intent to mark it held me fixd that of confession i no longer thought as through translucent and smooth glass or wave clear and unmovd and flowing not so deep as that its bed is dark the shape returns so faint of our impicturd lineaments that on white forehead set a pearl as strong comes to the eye such saw i many a face all stretchd to speak from whence i straight conceivd delusion opposite to that which raisd between the man and fountain amorous flame sudden as i perceivd them deeming these reflected semblances to see of whom they were i turnd mine eyes and nothing saw then turnd them back directed on the light of my sweet guide who smiling shot forth beams from her celestial eyes wonder not thou she cryd at this my smiling when i see thy childish judgment since not yet on truth it rests the foot but as it still is wont makes thee fall back in unsound vacancy true substances are these which thou beholdst hither through failure of their vow exild but speak thou with them listen and believe that the true light which fills them with desire permits not from its beams their feet to stray straight to the shadow which for converse seemd most earnest i addressed me and began as one by overeagerness perplexd o spirit born for joy who in the rays of life eternal of that sweetness knowst the flavour which not tasted passes far all apprehension me it well would please if thou wouldst tell me of thy name and this your station here whence she with kindness prompt and eyes glistning with smiles our charity to any wish by justice introducd bars not the door no more than she above who would have all her court be like herself i was a virgin sister in the earth and if thy mind observe me well this form with such addition gracd of loveliness will not conceal me long but thou wilt know piccarda in the tardiest sphere thus placd here mid these other blessed also blest our hearts whose high affections burn alone with pleasure from the holy spirit conceivd admitted to his order dwell in joy and this condition which appears so low is for this cause assignd us that our vows were in some part neglected and made void whence i to her replied something divine beams in your countenance wondrous fair from former knowledge quite transmuting you therefore to recollect was i so slow but what thou sayst hath to my memory given now such aid that to retrace your forms is easier yet inform me ye who here are happy long ye for a higher place more to behold and more in love to dwell she with those other spirits gently smild then answerd with such gladness that she seemd with loves first flame to glow brother our will is in composure settled by the power of charity who makes us will alone what we possess and nought beyond desire if we should wish to be exalted more then must our wishes jar with the high will of him who sets us here which in these orbs thou wilt confess not possible if here to be in charity must needs befall and if her nature well thou contemplate rather it is inherent in this state of blessedness to keep ourselves within the divine will by which our wills with his are one so that as we from step to step are placd throughout this kingdom pleases all een as our king who in us plants his will and in his will is our tranquillity it is the mighty ocean whither tends whatever it creates and nature makes then saw i clearly how each spot in heavn is paradise though with like gracious dew the supreme virtue showr not over all but as it chances if one sort of food hath satiated and of another still the appetite remains that this is askd and thanks for that returnd een so did i in word and motion bent from her to learn what web it was through which she had not drawn the shuttle to its point she thus began exalted worth and perfectness of life the lady higher up enshrine in heaven by whose pure laws upon your nether earth the robe and veil they wear to that intent that een till death they may keep watch or sleep with their great bridegroom who accepts each vow which to his gracious pleasure love conforms from the world to follow her when young escapd and in her vesture mantling me made promise of the way her sect enjoins thereafter men for ill than good more apt forth snatchd me from the pleasant cloisters pale god knows how after that my life was framd this other splendid shape which thou beholdst at my right side burning with all the light of this our orb what of myself i tell may to herself apply from her like me a sister with like violence were torn the saintly folds that shaded her fair brows een when she to the world again was brought in spite of her own will and better wont yet not for that the bosoms inward veil did she renounce this is the luminary of mighty constance who from that loud blast which blew the second over suabias realm that power producd which was the third and last she ceasd from further talk and then began ave maria singing and with that song vanishd as heavy substance through deep wave mine eye that far as it was capable pursued her when in dimness she was lost turnd to the mark where greater want impelld and bent on beatrice all its gaze but she as lightning beamd upon my looks so that the sight sustaind it not at first whence i to question her became less prompt canto iv between two kinds of food both equally remote and tempting first a man might die of hunger ere he one could freely choose een so would stand a lamb between the maw of two fierce wolves in dread of both alike een so between two deer a dog would stand wherefore if i was silent fault nor praise i to myself impute by equal doubts held in suspense since of necessity it happend silent was i yet desire was painted in my looks and thus i spake my wish more earnestly than language could as daniel when the haughty king he freed from ire that spurrd him on to deeds unjust and violent so lookd beatrice then well i discern she thus her words addressd how contrary desires each way constrain thee so that thy anxious thought is in itself bound up and stifled nor breathes freely forth thou arguest if the good intent remain what reason that anothers violence should stint the measure of my fair desert cause too thou findst for doubt in that it seems that spirits to the stars as plato deemd return these are the questions which thy will urge equally and therefore i the first of that will treat which hath the more of gall of seraphim he who is most enskyd moses and samuel and either john choose which thou wilt nor even marys self have not in any other heavn their seats than have those spirits which so late thou sawst nor more or fewer years exist but all make the first circle beauteous diversely partaking of sweet life as more or less afflation of eternal bliss pervades them here were they shown thee not that fate assigns this for their sphere but for a sign to thee of that celestial furthest from the height thus needs that ye may apprehend we speak since from things sensible alone ye learn that which digested rightly after turns to intellectual for no other cause the scripture condescending graciously to your perception hands and feet to god attributes nor so means and holy church doth represent with human countenance gabriel and michael and him who made tobias whole unlike what here thou seest the judgment of timaeus who affirms each soul restord to its particular star believing it to have been taken thence when nature gave it to inform her mold since to appearance his intention is een what his words declare or else to shun derision haply thus he hath disguisd his true opinion if his meaning be that to the influencing of these orbs revert the honour and the blame in human acts perchance he doth not wholly miss the truth this principle not understood aright erewhile perverted well nigh all the world so that it fell to fabled names of jove and mercury and mars that other doubt which moves thee is less harmful for it brings no peril of removing thee from me that to the eye of man our justice seems unjust is argument for faith and not for heretic declension to the end this truth may stand more clearly in your view i will content thee even to thy wish if violence be when that which suffers nought consents to that which forceth not for this these spirits stood exculpate for the will that will not still survives unquenchd and doth as nature doth in fire tho violence wrest it a thousand times for if it yield or more or less so far it follows force and thus did these whom they had power to seek the hallowd place again in them had will been perfect such as once upon the bars held laurence firm or wrought in scaevola to his own hand remorseless to the path whence they were drawn their steps had hastend back when liberty returnd but in too few resolve so steadfast dwells and by these words if duly weighd that argument is void which oft might have perplexd thee still but now another question thwarts thee which to solve might try thy patience without better aid i have no doubt instilld into thy mind that blessed spirit may not lie since near the source of primal truth it dwells for aye and thou mightst after of piccarda learn that constance held affection to the veil so that she seems to contradict me here not seldom brother it hath chancd for men to do what they had gladly left undone yet to shun peril they have done amiss een as alcmaeon at his fathers suit slew his own mother so made pitiless not to lose pity on this point bethink thee that force and will are blended in such wise as not to make the offence excusable absolute will agrees not to the wrong that inasmuch as there is fear of woe from noncompliance it agrees of will thus absolute piccarda spake and i of th other so that both have truly said such was the flow of that pure rill that welld from forth the fountain of all truth and such the rest that to my wondring thoughts i found o thou of primal love the prime delight goddess i straight replyd whose lively words still shed new heat and vigour through my soul affection fails me to requite thy grace with equal sum of gratitude be his to recompense who sees and can reward thee well i discern that by that truth alone enlightend beyond which no truth may roam our mind can satisfy her thirst to know therein she resteth een as in his lair the wild beast soon as she hath reachd that bound and she hath power to reach it else desire were given to no end and thence doth doubt spring like a shoot around the stock of truth and it is nature which from height to height on to the summit prompts us this invites this doth assure me lady revrently to ask thee of other truth that yet is dark to me i fain would know if man by other works well done may so supply the failure of his vows that in your scale they lack not weight i spake and on me straight beatrice lookd with eyes that shot forth sparks of love celestial in such copious stream that virtue sinking in me overpowerd i turnd and downward bent confusd my sight canto v if beyond earthly wont the flame of love illume me so that i oercome thy power of vision marvel not but learn the cause in that perfection of the sight which soon as apprehending hasteneth on to reach the good it apprehends i well discern how in thine intellect already shines the light eternal which to view alone neer fails to kindle love and if aught else your love seduces t is but that it shows some illmarkd vestige of that primal beam this wouldst thou know if failure of the vow by other service may be so supplied as from selfquestion to assure the soul thus she her words not heedless of my wish began and thus as one who breaks not off discourse continued in her saintly strain supreme of gifts which god creating gave of his free bounty sign most evident of goodness and in his account most prizd was liberty of will the boon wherewith all intellectual creatures and them sole he hath endowd hence now thou mayst infer of what high worth the vow which so is framd that when man offers god wellpleasd accepts for in the compact between god and him this treasure such as i describe it to thee he makes the victim and of his own act what compensation therefore may he find if that whereof thou hast oblation made by using well thou thinkst to consecrate thou wouldst of theft do charitable deed thus i resolve thee of the greater point but forasmuch as holy church herein dispensing seems to contradict the truth i have discoverd to thee yet behooves thou rest a little longer at the board ere the crude aliment which thou hast taken digested fitly to nutrition turn open thy mind to what i now unfold and give it inward keeping knowledge comes of learning well retaind unfruitful else this sacrifice in essence of two things consisteth one is that whereof t is made the covenant the other for the last it neer is cancelld if not kept and hence i spake erewhile so strictly of its force for this it was enjoind the israelites though leave were givn them as thou knowst to change the offering still to offer th other part the matter and the substance of the vow may well be such to that without offence it may for other substance be exchangd but at his own discretion none may shift the burden on his shoulders unreleasd by either key the yellow and the white nor deem of any change as less than vain if the last bond be not within the new included as the quatre in the six no satisfaction therefore can be paid for what so precious in the balance weighs that all in counterpoise must kick the beam take then no vow at random taen with faith preserve it yet not bent as jephthah once blindly to execute a rash resolve whom better it had suited to exclaim i have done ill than to redeem his pledge by doing worse or not unlike to him in folly that great leader of the greeks whence on the alter iphigenia mournd her virgin beauty and hath since made mourn both wise and simple even all who hear of so fell sacrifice be ye more staid o christians not like feather by each wind removable nor think to cleanse ourselves in every water either testament the old and new is yours and for your guide the shepherd of the church let this suffice to save you when by evil lust enticd remember ye be men not senseless beasts nor let the jew who dwelleth in your streets hold you in mockry be not as the lamb that fickle wanton leaves its mothers milk to dally with itself in idle play such were the words that beatrice spake these ended to that region where the world is liveliest full of fond desire she turnd though mainly prompt new question to propose her silence and changd look did keep me dumb and as the arrow ere the cord is still leapeth unto its mark so on we sped into the second realm there i beheld the dame so joyous enter that the orb grew brighter at her smiles and if the star were movd to gladness what then was my cheer whom nature hath made apt for every change as in a quiet and clear lake the fish if aught approach them from without do draw towards it deeming it their food so drew full more than thousand splendours towards us and in each one was heard lo one arrivd to multiply our loves and as each came the shadow streaming forth effulgence new witnessd augmented joy here reader think if thou didst miss the sequel of my tale to know the rest how sorely thou wouldst crave and thou shalt see what vehement desire possessd me as soon as these had met my view to know their state o born in happy hour thou to whom grace vouchsafes or ere thy close of fleshly warfare to behold the thrones of that eternal triumph know to us the light communicated which through heaven expatiates without bound therefore if aught thou of our beams wouldst borrow for thine aid spare not and of our radiance take thy fill thus of those piteous spirits one bespake me and beatrice next say on and trust as unto godshow in the light supreme thou harbourst and from thence the virtue bringst that sparkling in thine eyes denotes thy joy l mark but who thou art am still to seek or wherefore worthy spirit for thy lot this sphere assignd that oft from mortal ken is veild by others beams i said and turnd toward the lustre that with greeting kind erewhile had haild me forthwith brighter far than erst it waxd and as himself the sun hides through excess of light when his warm gaze hath on the mantle of thick vapours preyd within its proper ray the saintly shape was through increase of gladness thus conceald and shrouded so in splendour answerd me een as the tenour of my song declares canto

as thou in every contradiction seest the true and false opposd soon as my feet were to the church reclaimd to my great task by inspiration of gods grace impelld i gave me wholly and consignd mine arms to belisarius with whom heavens right hand was linkd in such conjointment t was a sign that i should rest to thy first question thus i shape mine answer which were ended here but that its tendency doth prompt perforce to some addition that thou well mayst mark what reason on each side they have to plead by whom that holiest banner is withstood both who pretend its power and who oppose beginning from that hour when pallas died to give it rule behold the valorous deeds have made it worthy reverence not unknown to thee how for three hundred years and more it dwelt in alba up to those fell lists

let him trust the fond belief that heavn will truck its armour for his lilied shield this little star is furnishd with good spirits whose mortal lives were busied to that end that honour and renown might wait on them and when desires thus err in their intention true love must needs ascend with slacker beam but it is part of our delight to measure our wages with the merit and admire the close proportion hence doth heavnly justice temper so evenly affection in us it neer can warp to any wrongfulness of diverse voices is sweet music made so in our life the different degrees render sweet

as one in slumber held not long that mood beatrice sufferd she with such a smile as might have made one blest amid the flames beaming upon me thus her words began thou in thy thought art pondring as i deem and what i deem is truth how just revenge could be with justice punishd from which doubt i soon will free thee so thou mark my words for they of weighty matter shall possess thee that man who was unborn himself condemnd and in himself all who since him have livd his offspring whence below the human kind lay sick in grievous error many an age until it pleasd the word of god to come amongst them down to his own person joining the nature from its maker far estrangd by the mere act of his eternal love contemplate here the wonder i unfold the nature with its maker thus conjoind created first was blameless pure and good but through itself alone was driven forth from paradise because it had eschewd the way of truth and life to evil turnd neer then was penalty so just as that inflicted by the cross if thou regard the nature in assumption doomd neer wrong so great in reference to him who took such nature on him and endurd the doom god therefore and the jews one sentence pleased so different effects flowd from one act and heavn was opend though the earth did quake count it not hard henceforth when thou dost hear that a just vengeance was by righteous court justly revengd but yet i see thy mind by thought on thought arising sore perplexd and with how vehement desire it asks solution of the maze what i have heard is plain thou sayst but wherefore god this way for our redemption chose eludes my search brother no eye of man not perfected nor fully ripend in the flame of love may fathom this decree it is a mark in sooth much aimd at and but little kennd and i will therefore show thee why such way was worthiest the celestial love that spume all envying in its bounty in itself with such effulgence blazeth as sends forth all beauteous things eternal what distils immediate thence no end of being knows bearing its seal immutably impressd whatever thence immediate falls is free free wholly uncontrollable by power of each thing new by such conformity more grateful to its author whose bright beams though all partake their shining yet in those are liveliest which resemble him the most these tokens of preeminence on man largely bestowd if any of them fail he needs must forfeit his nobility no longer stainless sin alone is that which doth disfranchise him and make unlike to the chief good for that its light in him is darkend and to dignity thus lost is no return unless where guilt makes void he for ill pleasure pay with equal pain your nature which entirely in its seed trangressd from these distinctions fell no less than from its state in paradise nor means found of recovery search all methods out as strickly as thou may save one of these the only fords were left through which to wade either that god had of his courtesy releasd him merely or else man himself for his own folly by himself atond fix now thine eye intently as thou canst on th everlasting counsel and explore instructed by my words the dread abyss man in himself had ever lackd the means of satisfaction for he could not stoop obeying in humility so low as high he disobeying thought to soar and for this reason he had vainly tried out of his own sufficiency to pay the rigid satisfaction then behooved that god should by his own ways lead him back unto the life from whence he fell restord by both his ways i mean or one alone but since the deed is ever prizd the more the more the doers good intent appears goodness celestial whose broad signature is on the universe of all its ways to raise ye up was fain to leave out none nor aught so vast or so magnificent either for him who gave or who receivd between the last night and the primal day was or can be for god more bounty showd giving himself to make man capable of his return to life than had the terms been mere and unconditional release and for his justice every method else were all too scant had not the son of god humbled himself to put on mortal flesh now to fulfil each wish of thine remains i somewhat further to thy view unfold that thou mayst see as clearly as myself i see thou sayst the air the fire i see the earth and water and all things of them compounded to corruption turn and soon dissolve yet these were also things create because if what were told me had been true they from corruption had been therefore free the angels o my brother and this clime wherein thou art impassible and pure i call created as indeed they are in their whole being but the elements which thou hast namd and what of them is made are by created virtue informd create their substance and create the informing virtue in these bright stars that round them circling move the soul of every brute and of each plant the ray and motion of the sacred lights with complex potency attract and turn but this our life the eternal good inspires immediate and enamours of itself so that our wishes rest for ever here and hence thou mayst by inference conclude our resurrection certain if thy mind consider how the human flesh was framd when both our parents at the first were made canto viii the world was in its day of peril dark wont to believe the dotage of fond love from the fair cyprian deity who rolls in her third epicycle shed on men by stream of potent radiance therefore they of elder time in their old error blind not her alone with sacrifice adord and invocation but like honours paid to cupid and dione deemd of them her mother and her son him whom they feignd to sit in didos bosom and from her whom i have sung preluding borrowd they the appellation of that star which views now obvious and now averse the sun i was not ware that

moves the third heaven and in one orb we roll one motion one impulse with those who rule princedoms in heaven yet are of love so full that to please thee t will be as sweet to rest after mine eyes had with meek reverence sought the celestial guide and were by her assurd they turnd again unto the light who had so largely promisd and with voice that bare the lively pressure of my zeal tell who ye are

eternally as now and if it doth how when ye shall regain your visible forms the sight may without harm endure the change that also tell as those who in a ring tread the light measure in their fitful mirth raise loud the voice and spring with gladder bound thus at the hearing of that pious suit the saintly circles in their tourneying and wondrous note attested new delight whoso laments that we must doff this garb of frail mortality thenceforth to live immortally above he hath not seen the sweet refreshing of that heavnly shower him who lives ever and for ever reigns in mystic union of the three in one unbounded bounding all each spirit thrice sang with such melody as but to hear for highest merit were an ample meed and from the lesser orb the goodliest light with gentle voice and mild

blessedness exceeding as it hath grave beyond its virtue great our shape regarmented with glorious weeds of saintly flesh must being thus entire show yet more gracious therefore shall increase whateer

comes from it but as the greed which gives out flame yet it its whiteness shines more lively than that and so preserves its proper semblance thus this circling sphere of splendour shall to view less radiant seem than shall our fleshly robe which yonder earth now covers nor will such excess of light oerpower us in corporeal organs made firm and susceptible of all delight so ready and so cordial an amen followed from either choir as plainly spoke desire of their dead bodies yet perchance not for themselves but for their kindred dear mothers and sires and those whom best they lovd ere they were made imperishable flame and lo forthwith there rose up round about a lustre over that already there of equal clearness like the brightening up of the horizon as at an evening hour of twilight new appearances through heavn peer with faint glimmer doubtfully descried so there new substances methought began to rise in view and round the other twain enwheeling sweep their ampler circuit wide o gentle glitter of eternal beam with what a such whiteness did it flow oerpowering vision in me but so fair so passing lovely beatrice showd mind cannot follow it nor words express her infinite sweetness thence mine eyes regaind power to look up and i beheld myself sole with my lady to more lofty bliss translated for the star with warmer smile impurpled well denoted our ascent with all the heart and with that tongue which speaks the same in all an holocaust i made to god befitting the new grace vouchsafd and from my bosom had not yet upsteamd the fuming of that incense when i knew the rite accepted with such mighty sheen and mantling crimson in two listed rays the splendours shot before me that i cried god of sabaoth that does prank them thus as leads the galaxy from pole to pole

conjoining frame here memory mocks the toil of genius christ beamd on that cross and pattern fails me now but whoso takes his cross and follows christ will pardon me for that i leave untold when in the fleckerd dawning he shall spy the glitterance of christ from horn to horn and tween the summit and the base did move lights scintillating as they met and passd thus oft are seen with everchangeful glance straight or athwart now rapid and now slow the atomies of bodies long or short to move along the sunbeam whose slant line checkers the shadow interposd by art against the noontide heat and as the chime of minstrel music dulcimer and help with many strings a pleasant dining makes to him who heareth not distinct the note so from the lights which there appeard to me gatherd along the cross a melody that indistinctly heard with ravishment possessd me yet i markd it was a hymn of lofty praises for there came to me arise and conquer as to one who hears and comprehends not me such ecstasy oercame that never till that hour was thing that held me in so sweet imprisonment perhaps my saying over bold appears accounting less the pleasure of those eyes whereon to look fulfilleth all desire but he who is aware those living seals of every beauty work with quicker force the higher they are risn and that there i had not turnd me to them he may well excuse me that whereof in my excuse i do accuse me and may own my truth that holy pleasure here not yet reveald which grows in transport as we mount aloof canto xv true love that ever shows itself as clear in kindness as loose appetite in wrong silenced that lyre harmonious and stilld the sacred chords that are by heavns right hand unwound and tightend flow to righteous prayers should they not hearken who to give me will for praying in accordance thus were mute he hath in sooth good cause for endless grief who for the love of thing that lasteth not despoils himself forever of that love as oft along the still and pure serene at nightfall glides a sudden trail of fire attracting with involuntary heed the eye to follow it erewhile at rest and seems some star that shifted place in heavn only that whence it kindles none is lost and it is soon extinct thus from the horn that on the dexter of the cross extends down to its foot one luminary ran from mid the cluster shone there yet no gem droppd from its foil and through the beamy list like flame in alabaster glowd its course so forward stretchd him if of credence aught our greater muse may claim the pious ghost of old anchises in the elysian bower when he perceivd his son o thou my blood o most exceeding grace divine to whom as now to thee hath twice the heavnly gate been eer unclosd so spake the light whence i turnd me toward him then unto my dame my sight directed and on either side amazement waited me for in her eyes was lighted such a smile i thought that mine had divd unto the bottom of my grace and of my bliss in paradise forthwith to hearing and to sight grateful alike the spirit to his proem added things i understood not so profound he spake yet not of choice but through necessity mysterious for his high conception scard beyond the mark of mortals when the flight of holy transport had so spent its rage that nearer to the level of our thought the speech descended the first sounds i heard were best he thou triunal deity that hast such favour in my seed vouchsafd then followd no unpleasant thirst tho long which took me reading in the sacred book whose leaves or white or dusky never change thou hast allayd my son within this light from whence my voice thou hearst more thanks to her who for such lofty mounting has with plumes begirt thee thou dost deem thy thoughts to me from him transmitted who is first of all een as all numbers ray from unity and therefore dost not ask me who i am or why to thee more joyous i appear than any other in this gladsome throng the truth is as thou deemst for in this hue both less and greater in that mirror look in which thy thoughts or ere thou thinkst are shown but that the love which keeps me wakeful ever urging with sacred thirst of sweet desire may be contended fully let thy voice fearless and frank and jocund utter forth thy will distinctly utter forth the wish whereto my ready answer stands decreed i turnd me to beatrice and she heard ere i had spoken smiling an assent

found no room for other wish while the everlasting pleasure that did full on beatrice shine with second view from her fair countenance my gladdend soul contented vanquishing me with a beam of her soft

tuneful skill to beatrice on my right l bent looking for intimation or by word or act what next behoovd and did descry such mere effulgence in her eyes such joy it past all former wont and as by sense of new delight the man who perseveres in good deeds doth perceive from day to day his virtue growing i een thus perceivd of my ascent together with the heavn the circuit widend noting the increase of beauty in that wonder like the change in a brief moment on some maidens cheek which from its fairness doth discharge the weight of pudency that staind it such in her and to mine eyes so sudden was the change through silvery whiteness of that temperate star whose sixth orb now enfolded us i saw within that jovial cresset the clear sparks of love that reignd there fashion to my view our language and as birds from river banks arisen now in round now lengthend troop array them in their flight greeting as seems their newfound pastures so within the lights the saintly creatures flying sang and made

the m of the fifth word they held their station making the star seem silver streakd with gold and on the summit of the m i saw descending other lights that rested there singing methinks their bliss and primal good then as at shaking of a lighted brand sparkles innumerable on all sides rise scatterd source of augury to th unwise thus more than thousand twinkling lustres hence seemd reascending and a higher pitch some mounting and some less een as the sun which kindleth them decreed and when each one had settled in his place the head and neck then saw i of an eagle lively gravd in that

doth rise to vitiate thy beam so that once more he may put forth his hand gainst such as drive their traffic in that sanctuary whose walls with miracles and martyrdoms were built ye host of heaven whose glory i survey l o beg ye grace for those that are on earth all after ill example gone astray war once had for its instrument the sword but now t is made taking the bread away which the good father locks from none and thou that writes but to cancel think that they who for the vineyard which thou wastest died peter and paul live yet and mark thy doings thou hast good cause to cry my heart so cleaves to him that livd in solitude remote and from the wilds was draggd to martyrdom i wist not of the fisherman nor paul canto xix before my sight appeard with open wings the beauteous image in fruition sweet gladdening the thronged spirits each did seem a little ruby whereon so intense the sunbeam glowd that to mine eyes it came in clear refraction and that which next befalls me to portray voice hath not utterd nor hath ink written nor in fantasy was eer conceivd for i beheld and heard the beak discourse and what intention formd of many singly as of one express beginning for that i was

faithful mirror the celestial justice yours without veil reflects it ye discern the heed wherewith i do prepare myself to hearken ye the doubt that urges me with such inveterate craving straight i saw like to a falcon issuing from the hood that rears his head and claps him with his wings his beauty and his eagerness bewraying so saw i move that stately sign with praise of grace divine inwoven and high song of inexpressive joy he it began who turnd his compass on the worlds extreme and in that space so variously hath wrought both openly and in secret in such wise could not through all the universe display impression of his glory that the word of his omniscience should not still remain in infinite excess in proof whereof he first through pride supplanted who was sum of each created being waited not for light celestial and abortive fell whence needs each lesser nature is but scant receptacle unto that good which knows no limit measurd by itself alone therefore your sight of th omnipresent mind a single beam its origin must own surpassing far its utmost potency the ken your world is gifted with descends in th everlasting justice as low down as eye doth in the sea which though it mark the bottom from the shore in the wide main discerns it not and neertheless it is but hidden through its deepness light is none save that which cometh from the pure serene of neer disturbed ether for the rest tis darkness all or shadow of the flesh or else its poison here confess reveald that covert which hath hidden from thy search the living justice of the which thou madst such frequent question for thou saidsta man is born on indus banks and none is there who speaks of christ nor who doth read nor write and all his inclinations and his acts as far as human reason sees are good and he offendeth not in word or deed but unbaptizd he dies and void of faith where is the justice that condemns him where his blame if he believeth notwhat then and who art thou that on the stool wouldst sit to judge at distance of a thousand miles with the shortsighted vision of a span to him who subtilizes thus with me there would assuredly be room for doubt even to wonder did not the safe word of scripture hold supreme authority o animals of clay o spirits gross i the primal will that in itself is good hath from itself the chief good neer been movd justice consists in consonance with it derivable by no created good whose very cause depends upon its beam as on her nest the stork that turns about unto her young whom lately she hath fed while they with upward eyes do look on her

th eternal judgment unto mortal ken then still abiding in that ensign rangd wherewith the romans overawed the world those burning splendours of the holy spirit took up the strain and thus it spake again none ever hath ascended to this realm who hath not a believer been in christ either before or after the blest limbs were naild upon the wood but lo of those who call christ christ there shall be many found in judgment further off from him by far than such to whom his name was never known christians like these the ethiop shall condemn when that the two assemblages shall part one rich eternally

erewhile irradiate only with his beam is yet again unfolded putting forth innumerable lights wherein one shines of such vicissitude in heaven i thought as the great sign that marshaleth the world and the worlds leaders in the blessed beak was silent for that all those living lights waxing in splendour burst forth into songs such as from memory glide and fall away sweet love that dost apparel thee in smiles how lustrous was thy semblance in those sparkles which merely are from holy thoughts inspird after the precious and bright beaming stones that did ingem the sixth light ceasd the chiming of their angelic bells methought i heard the murmuring of a river that doth fall from rock to rock transpicuous making known the richness of his springhead and as sound of cistern at the fretboard or of pipe is at the windhole modulate and tund thus up the neck as it were hollow rose that murmuring of the eagle and forthwith voice there assumd and thence along the beak issued in form of words such as

erring world beneath would deem that trojan ripheus in this round was set fifth of the saintly splendours now he knows enough of that which the world cannot see the grace divine albeit een his sight reach not its utmost depth like to the lark that warbling in the air expatiates long then trilling out his last sweet melody drops satiate with the sweetness such appeard that image stampt by the everlasting pleasure which fashions like itself all lovely things i though my doubting were as manifest as is through glass the hue that mantles it in silence waited not for to my lips what things are these involuntary rushd and forcd a passage out whereat i markd a sudden lightening and new revelry the eye was kindled and the blessed sign no more to keep me wondring and suspense replied i see that thou believst these things because i tell them but discernst not how so that thy knowledge waits not on thy faith as one who knows the name of thing by rote but is a stranger to its properties till others tongue reveal them fervent love and lively hope with violence assail the kingdom of the heavens and overcome the will of the most high not in such sort as man prevails oer man but conquers it because t is willing to be conquerd still though conquerd by its mercy conquering those in the eye who live the first and fifth cause thee to marvel in that thou beholdst the region of the angels deckd with them they quitted not their bodies as thou deemst gentiles but christians in firm rooted faith this of the feet in future to be piercd that of feet naild already to the cross one from the barrier of the dark abyss where never any with good will returns came back unto his bones of lively hope such was the meed of lively hope that wingd the prayers sent up to god for his release and put power into them to bend his will the glorious spirit of whom i speak to thee a little while returning to the flesh believd in him who had the means to help and in believing nourishd such a flame of holy love that at the second death he was made sharer in our gamesome mirth the other through the riches of that grace which from so deep a fountain doth distil as never eye created saw its rising placd all his love below on just and right wherefore of grace god opd in him the eye to the redemption of mankind to come wherein believing he endurd no more the filth of paganism and for their ways rebukd the stubborn nations the three nymphs whom at the right wheel thou beheldst advancing were sponsors for him more than thousand years before baptizing o how far removd predestination is thy root from such as see not the first cause entire and ye o mortal men be wary how ye judge for we who see our maker know not yet the number of the chosen and esteem such scantiness of knowledge our delight for all our good is in that primal good concentrate and gods will and ours are one so by that form divine was givn to me sweet medicine to clear and strengthen sight and as one handling skillfully the harp attendant on some skilful songsters voice bids the chords vibrate and therein the song acquires more pleasure so the whilst it spake it doth remember me that i beheld the pair of blessed luminaries move like the accordant twinkling of two eyes their beamy circlets dancing to the sounds canto xxi again mine eyes were fixd on beatrice and with mine eyes my soul that in her looks found all contentment yet no smile she wore and did i smile quoth she thou wouldst be straight like semele when into ashes turnd for mounting these eternal palacestairs my beauty which the loftier it climbs as thou hast noted still doth kindle more so shines that were no tempring interposd thy mortal puissance would from its rays shrink as the leaf doth from the thunderbolt into the seventh splendour are we wafted that underneath the burning lions breast beams in this hour commingled with his might thy mind be with thine eyes and in them mirrord the shape which in this mirror shall be shown whoso can deem how fondly i had fed my sight upon her blissful countenance may know when to new thoughts i changd what joy to do the bidding of my heavnly guide in equal balance poising either weight within the crystal which records the name as its remoter circle girds the world of that lovd monarch in whose happy reign no ill had power to harm i saw reard up in colour like to sunillumind gold a ladder which my ken pursued in vain so lofty was the summit down whose steps i saw the splendours in such multitude descending evry light in heavn methought was shed thence as the rooks at dawn of day bestirring them to dry their feathers chill some speed their way afield and homeward some returning cross their flight while some abide and wheel around their airy lodge so seemd that glitterance wafted on alternate wing as upon certain stair it met and clashd its shining and one lingring near us waxd so bright that in my thought said the love which this betokens me admits no doubt unwillingly from question i refrain to her by whom my silence and my speech are orderd looking for a sign whence she who in the sight of him that seeth all saw wherefore i was silent prompted me t indulge the fervent wish and i began i am not worthy of my own desert that thou shouldst answer me but for her sake who hath vouchsafd my asking spirit blest that in thy joy art shrouded say the cause which bringeth thee so near and wherefore say doth the sweet symphony of paradise keep silence here pervading with such sounds of rapt devotion evry lower sphere mortal art thou in hearing as in sight was the reply and what forbade the smile of beatrice interrupts our song only to yield thee gladness of my voice and of the light that vests me i thus far descend these hallowd steps not that more love invites me for lo there aloft as much or more of love is witnessd in those flames but such my lot by charity assignd that makes us ready servants as thou seest to execute the counsel of the highest that in this court said i o sacred lamp love no compulsion needs but follows free th eternal providence i well discern this harder find to deem why of thy peers thou only to this office wert foredoomd i had not ended when like rapid mill upon its centre whirld the light and then the love that did inhabit there replied splendour eternal piercing through these folds its virtue to my vision knits and thus supported lifts me so above myself that on the sovran essence which it wells from i have the power to gaze and hence the joy wherewith i sparkle equaling with my blaze the keenness of my sight but not the soul that is in heavn most lustrous nor the seraph that hath his eyes most fixd on god shall solve what thou hast askd for in th abyss it lies of th everlasting statute sunk so low that no created ken may fathom it and to the mortal world when thou returnst be this reported that none henceforth dare direct his footsteps to so dread a bourn the mind that here is radiant on the earth is wrapt in mist look then if she may do below what passeth her ability when she is taen to heavn by words like these admonishd i the question urgd no more and of the spirit humbly sued alone t instruct me of its state twixt either shore of italy nor distant from thy land a stony ridge ariseth in such sort the thunder doth not lift his voice so high they call it catria at whose foot a cell is sacred to the lonely eremite for worship set apart and holy rites a third time thus it spake then added there so firmly to gods service i adherd that with no costlier viands than the juice of olives easily i passd the heats of summer and the winter frosts content in heavnward musings rich were the returns and fertile which that cloister once was usd to render to these heavens now t is falln into a waste so empty that ere long detection must lay bare its vanity pietro damiano there was i yclept pietro the sinner when before i dwelt beside the adriatic in the house of our blest lady near upon my close of mortal life through much importuning i was constraind to wear the hat that still from bad to worse it shiftedcephas came he came who was the holy spirits vessel barefoot and lean eating their bread as chancd at the first table modern shepherds need those who on either hand may prop and lead them so burly are they grown and from behind others to hoist them down the palfreys sides spread their broad mantles so as both the beasts are coverd with one skin o patience thou that lookst on this and doth endure so long i at those accents saw the splendours down from step to step alight and wheel and wax each circuiting more beautiful round this they came and stayd them uttered them a shout so loud it hath no likeness here nor i wist what it spake so deafning was the thunder canto xxii astounded to the guardian of my steps i turnd me like the chill who always runs thither for succour where he trusteth most and she was like the mother who her son beholding pale and breathless with her voice soothes him and he is cheerd for thus she spake soothing me knowst not thou thou art in heavn and knowst not thou whatever is in heavn is holy and that nothing there is done but is done zealously and well deem now what change in thee the song and what my smile had wrought since thus the shout had powr to move thee in which couldst thou have understood their prayers the vengeance were already known to thee which thou must witness ere thy mortal hour the sword of heavn is not in haste to smite nor yet doth linger save unto his seeming who in desire or fear doth look for it but elsewhere now l bid thee turn thy view so shalt thou many a famous spirit behold mine eyes directing as she willd i saw a hundred little spheres that fairer grew by interchange of splendour i remaind as one who fearful of oermuch presuming abates in him the keenness of desire nor dares to question when amid those pearls one largest and most lustrous onward drew that it might yield contentment to my wish and from within it these the sounds i heard if thou like me beheldst the charity that burns amongst us what thy mind conceives were utterd but that ere the lofty bound thou reach expectance may not weary thee i will make answer even to the thought which thou hast such respect of in old days that mountain at whose side cassino rests was on its height frequented by a race deceived and ill disposd and i it was who thither carried first the name of him who brought the soulsubliming truth to man and such a speeding grace shone over me that from their impious worship i reclaimd the dwellers round about who with the world were in delusion lost these other flames the spirits of men contemplative were all enlivend by that warmth whose kindly force gives birth to flowers and fruits of holiness here is macarius romoaldo here and here my brethren who their steps refraind within the cloisters and held firm their heart i answring thus thy gentle words and kind and this the cheerful semblance i behold

entreat i father to declare if i may gain such favour as to gaze upon thine image by no covering veild brother he thus rejoind in the last sphere expect completion of thy lofty aim for there on each desire completion waits and there on mine where every aim is found perfect entire and for fulfillment ripe there all things are as they have ever been for space is none to bound nor pole divides our ladder reaches even to that clime and so at giddy distance mocks thy view thither the patriarch jacob saw it stretch its topmost round when it appeard to him with angels laden but to mount it now none lifts his foot from earth and hence my rule is left a profitless stain upon the leaves the walls for abbey reard turned into dens the cowls to sacks choakd up with musty meal foul usury doth not more lift itself against gods pleasure than that fruit which makes the hearts of monks so wanton for whateer is in the churchs keeping all pertains to such as sue for heavns sweet sake and not to those who

passage at your clime to you my soul devoutly sighs for virtue even now to meet the hard emprize that draws me on thou art so near the sum of blessedness said beatrice that behooves thy ken be vigilant and clear and to this end or even thou advance thee further hence look downward and contemplate what a world already stretched under our feet there lies so as thy heart may in its blithest mood present itself to the triumphal throng which through the etherial concave comes rejoicing i straight obeyd and with mine eye returnd through all the seven spheres and saw this globe so pitiful of semblance that perforce it moved my smiles and him in truth i hold for wisest who esteems it least whose thoughts elsewhere are fixd him worthiest call and best i saw the daughter of latona shine

joves tempering twixt his sire and son and hence their changes and their various aspects distinctly scannd nor might i not descry of all the seven how bulky each how swift nor of their several distances not learn this petty area oer the which we stride so fiercely as along the eternal twins i wound my way appeard before me all forth from the havens stretchd unto the hills then to the

from the east her eager ken so stood the dame erect and bent her glance wistfully on that region where the sun abateth most his speed that seeing her suspense and wandring i became as one in whom desire is wakend and the hope of somewhat new to come fills with delight short space ensued i was not held i say long in expectance when i saw the heavn wax more and more resplendent and behold cried beatrice the triumphal hosts of christ and all the harvest reapd at length of thy ascending up these spheres meseemd that while she spake her image all did burn and in her eyes such fullness was of joy and i am fain to pass unconstrued by as in the calm full moon when trivia smiles in peerless beauty mid th eternal nympus that paint through all its gulfs the blue profound in bright preeminence so saw i there oer million lamps a sun from whom all drew their radiance as from ours the starry train and through the living light so lustrous glowd the substance that my ken endurd it not o beatrice sweet and precious guide who cheerd me with her comfortable words against the virtue that oerpowreth thee avails not to resist here is the might and here the wisdom which did open lay the path that had been yearned for so long betwixt the heavn and earth like to the fire that in a cloud imprisond doth break out expansive so that from its womb enlargd it falleth against nature to the ground thus in that heavnly banqueting my soul outgrew herself and in the transport lost holds now remembrance none of what she was ope thou thine eyes and mark me thou hast seen things that empower thee to sustain my smile i was as one when a forgotten dream doth come across him and he strives in vain to shape it in his fantasy again whenas that gracious boon was profferd me which never may be canceld from the book wherein the past is written now were all those tongues to sound that have on sweetest milk of polyhymnia and her sisters fed and fattend not with all their help to boot unto the thousandth parcel of the truth my song might shadow forth that saintly smile flow merely in her saintly looks it wrought and with such figuring of paradise the sacred strain must leap like one that meets a sudden interruption to his road but he who thinks how ponderous the theme and that t is lain upon a mortal shoulder may pardon if it tremble with the burden the track our ventrous keel must furrow brooks no unribbd pinnace no selfsparing pilot why doth my face said beatrice thus enamour thee as that thou dost not turn unto the beautiful garden blossoming beneath the rays of christ here is the rose wherein the word divine was made incarnate and here the lilies by whose odour known the way of life was followd prompt i heard her bidding and encounter once again the strife of aching vision as erewhile through glance of sunlight streamd through broken cloud mine eyes a flowerbesprinkled mead have seen though veild themselves in shade so saw i there legions of splendours on whom burning rays shed lightnings from above yet saw i not the fountain whence they flowd o gracious virtue thou whose broad stamp is on them higher up thou didst exalt thy glory to give room to my oerlabourd sight when at the name of that fair flower whom duly i invoke both morn and eve my soul with all her might collected on the goodliest ardour fixd and as the bright dimensions of the star in heavn excelling as once here on earth were in my eyeballs lively portrayd lo from within the sky a cresset fell circling in fashion of a diadem and girt the star and hovring round it wheeld whatever melody sounds sweetest here and draws the spirit most unto itself might seem a rent cloud when it grates the thunder compard unto the sounding of that lyre wherewith the goodliest sapphire that inlays the floor of heavn was crownd angelic love i am who thus with hovring flight enwheel the lofty rapture from that womb inspird where our desire did dwell and round thee so lady of heavn will hover long as thou thy son shalt follow and diviner joy shall from thy presence gild the highest sphere such close was to the circling melody and as it ended all the other lights took up the strain and echoed marys name the robe that with its regal folds enwraps the world and with the nearer breath of god doth burn and quiver held so far retird its inner hem and skirting over us that yet no glimmer of its majesty had streamd unto me therefore were mine eyes unequal to pursue the crowned flame that rose and sought its natal seed of fire and like to babe that stretches forth its arms for very eagerness towards the breast after the milk is taken so outstretchd their wavy summits all the fervent band through zealous love to mary then in view there halted and regina coeli sang so sweetly the delight hath left me never o what oerflowing plenty is uppild in those richladen coffers which below sowd the good seed whose harvest now they keep here are the treasures tasted that with tears were in the babylonian exile won when gold had faild them here in synod high of ancient council with the new convend under the son of mary and of god victorious he his mighty triumph holds to whom the keys of glory were assignd canto xxiv o ye in chosen fellowship advancd to the great supper of the blessed lamb whereon who feeds hath every wish fulfilld if to this man through gods grace be vouchsafd foretaste of that which from your table falls or ever death his fated term prescribe be ye not heedless of his urgent will but may some influence of your sacred dews sprinkle him of the fount ye alway drink whence flows what most he craves beatrice spake and the rejoicing spirits like to spheres on firmset poles revolving traild a blaze of comet splendour and as wheels that wind their circles in the horologe so work the stated rounds that to th observant eye the first seems still and as it flew the last een thus their carols weaving variously they by the measure pacd or swift or slow made me to rate the riches of their joy from that which i did note in beauty most excelling saw i issue forth a flame so bright as none was left more goodly there round beatrice thrice it wheeld about with so divine a song that fancys ear records it not and the pen passeth on and leaves a blank for that our mortal speech nor een the inward shaping of the brain hath colours fine enough to trace such folds o saintly sister mine thy prayer devout is with so vehement affection urgd thou dost unbind me from that beauteous sphere such were the accents towards my lady breathd from that blest ardour soon as it was stayd to whom she thus o everlasting light of him within whose mighty grasp our lord did leave the keys which of this wondrous bliss he bare below tent this man as thou wilt with lighter probe or deep touching the faith by the which thou didst on the billows walk if he in love in hope and in belief be steadfast is not hid from thee for thou hast there thy ken where all things are beheld in liveliest portraiture but since true faith has peopled this fair realm with citizens meet is that to exalt its glory more thou in his audience shouldst thereof discourse like to the bachelor who arms himself and speaks not till the master have proposd the question to approve and not to end it so i in silence armd me while she spake summoning up each argument to aid as was behooveful for such questioner and such profession as good christian ought declare thee what is faith whereat i raisd my forehead to the light whence this had breathd then turnd to beatrice and in her looks approval met that from their inmost fount i should unlock the waters may the grace that giveth me the captain of the church for confessor said i vouchsafe to me apt utterance for my thoughts then added sire een as set down by the unerring style of thy dear brother who with thee conspird to bring rome in unto the way of life faith of things hopd is substance and the proof of things not seen and herein doth consist methinks its essencerightly hast thou deemd was answerd if thou well discern why first he hath defind it substance and then proof the deep things i replied which here i scan distinctly are below from mortal eye so hidden they have in belief alone their being on which credence hope sublime is built and therefore substance it intends and inasmuch as we must needs infer from such belief our reasoning all respect to other view excluded hence of proof th intention is derivd forthwith i heard if thus whateer by learning men attain were understood the sophist would want room to exercise his wit so breathd the flame of love then added current is the coin thou utterst both in weight and in alloy but tell me if thou hast it in thy purse even so glittering and so round said i i not a whit misdoubt of its assay next issued from the deep imbosomd splendour say whence the costly jewel on the which is founded every virtue came to thee the flood i answerd from the spirit of god raind down upon the ancient bond and new here is the reasning that convinceth me so feelingly each argument beside seems blunt and forceless in comparison then heard i wherefore holdest thou that each the elder proposition and the new which so persuade thee are the voice of heavn the works that followd evidence their truth i answerd nature did not make for these the iron hot or on her anvil mould them who voucheth to thee of the works themselves was the reply that they in very deed are that they purport none hath sworn so to thee that all the world said i should have been turnd to christian and no miracle been wrought would in itself be such a miracle the rest were not an hundredth part so great een thou wentst forth in poverty and hunger to set the goodly plant that from the vine it once was now is grown unsightly bramble that ended through the high celestial court resounded all the spheres praise we one god in song of most unearthly melody and when that worthy thus from branch to branch examining had led me that we now approachd the topmost bough he straight resumd the grace that holds sweet dalliance with thy soul so far discreetly hath thy lips unclosd that whatsoeer has past them i commend behooves thee to express what thou believst the next and whereon thy belief hath grown o saintly sire and spirit i began who seest that which thou didst so believe as to outstrip feet younger than thine own toward the sepulchre thy will is here that i the tenour of my creed unfold and thou the cause of it hast likewise askd and i reply i in one god believe one sole eternal godhead of whose love all heavn is movd himself unmovd the while nor demonstration physical alone or more intelligential and abstruse persuades me to this faith but from that truth it cometh to me rather which is shed through moses the rapt prophets and the psalms the gospel and that ye yourselves did write when ye were gifted of the holy ghost in three eternal persons i believe essence threefold and one mysterious league of union absolute which many a time the word of gospel lore upon my mind imprints and from this germ this firstling spark the lively flame dilates and like heavns star doth glitter in me as the master hears well pleasd and then enfoldeth in his arms the servant who hath joyful tidings brought and having told the errand keeps his peace thus benediction uttering with song soon as my peace i held compassd me thrice the apostolic radiance whose behest had opd lips so well their answer pleasd canto xxv if eer the sacred poem that hath made both heavn and earth copartners in its toil and with lean abstinence through many a year faded my brow be destind to prevail over the cruelty which bars me forth of the fair sheepfold where a sleeping lamb the wolves set on and fain had worried me with other voice and fleece of other grain i shall forthwith return and standing up at my baptismal font shall claim the wreath due to the poets temples for i there first enterd on the faith which maketh souls acceptable to god and for its sake peter had then circled my forehead thus next from the squadron whence had issued forth the first fruit of christs vicars on the earth toward us movd a light at view whereof my lady full of gladness spake to me lo lo behold the peer of mickle might that makes falicia throngd with visitants as when the ringdove by his mate alights in circles each about the other wheels and murmuring cooes his fondness thus saw i one of the other great and glorious prince with kindly greeting haild extolling both their heavenly banqueting but when an end was to their gratulation silent each before me sat they down so burning bright i could not look upon them smiling then beatrice spake o life in glory shrind who didst the largess of our kingly court set down with faithful pen let now thy voice of hope the praises in this height resound for thou who figurst them in shapes as clear as jesus stood before thee well canst speak them lift up thy head and be thou strong in trust for that which hither from the mortal world arriveth must be ripend in our beam such cheering accents from the second flame assurd me and mine eyes i lifted up unto the mountains that had bowd them late with overheavy burden sith our liege wills of his grace that thou or ere thy death in the most secret council with his lords shouldst be confronted so that having viewd the glories of our court thou mayst therewith thyself and all who hear invigorate with hope that leads to blissful end declare what is that hope how it doth flourish in thee and whence thou hadst it thus proceeding still the second light and she whose gentle love my soaring pennons in that lofty flight escorted thus preventing me rejoind among her sons not one more full of hope hath the church militant so t is of him recorded in the sun whose liberal orb enlighteneth all our tribe and ere his term of warfare hence permitted he is come from egypt to jerusalem to see the other points both which thou hast inquird not for more knowledge but that he may tell how dear thou holdst the virtue these to him leave i for he may answer thee with ease and without boasting so god give him grace like to the scholar practisd in his task who willing to give proof of diligence seconds his teacher gladly hope said i is of the joy to come a sure expectance th effect of grace divine and merit preceding this light from many a star visits my heart but flowd to me the first from him who sang the songs of the supreme himself supreme among his tuneful brethren let all hope in thee so speak his anthem who have known thy name and with my faith who know not that from thee the next distilling from his spring in thine epistle fell on me the drops so plenteously that i on others shower the influence of their dew whileas i spake a lamping as of quick and vollied lightning within the bosom of that mighty sheen playd tremulous then forth these accents breathd love for the virtue which attended me een to the palm and issuing from the field glows vigorous yet within me and inspires to ask of thee whom also it delights what promise thou from hope in chief dost win both scriptures new and ancient i replyd propose the mark which even now i view for souls belovd of god isaias saith that in their own land each one must be clad in twofold vesture and their proper lands this delicious life in terms more full and clearer far thy brother hath set forth this revelation to us where he tells of the white raiment destind to the saints and as the words were ending from above they hope in thee first heard we cried whereto answerd the carols all amidst them next a light of so clear amplitude emergd that winters month were but a single day were such a crystal in the cancers sign like as a virgin riseth up and goes and enters on the mazes of the dance though gay yet innocent of worse intent than to do fitting honour to the bride so i beheld the new effulgence come unto the other two who in a ring wheeld as became their rapture in the dance and in the song it mingled and the dame held on them fixd her looks een as the spouse silent and moveless this is he who lay upon the bosom of our pelican this he into whose keeping from the cross the mighty charge was given thus she spake yet therefore naught the more removd her sight from marking them or ere her words began or when they closd as he who looks intent and strives with searching ken how he may see the sun in his eclipse and through desire of seeing loseth power of sight so i peerd on that last resplendence while i heard why dazzlest thou thine eyes in seeking that which here abides not earth my body is in earth and shall be with the rest so long as till our number equal the decree of the most high the two that have ascended in this our blessed cloister shine alone with the two garments so report below as when for ease of labour or to shun suspected peril at a whistles breath the oars erewhile dashd frequent in the wave all rest the flamy circle at that voice so rested and the mingling sound was still which from the trinal band softbreathing rose i turnd but ah how trembled in my thought when looking at my side again to see beatrice i descried her not although not distant on the happy coast she stood canto xxvi with dazzled eyes whilst wondring i remaind forth of the beamy flame which dazzled me issued a breath that in attention mute detaind me and these words it spake t were well that long as till thy vision on my form oerspent regain its virtue with discourse thou compensate the brief delay say then beginning to what point thy soul aspires and meanwhile rest assurd that sight in thee is but oerpowered a space not wholly quenchd since thy fair guide and lovely in her look hath potency the like to that which dwelt in ananias hand i answering thus be to mine eyes the remedy or late or early at her pleasure for they were the gates at which she enterd and did light her never dying fire my wishes here are centered in this palace is the weal that alpha and omega is to all the lessons love can read me yet again the voice which had dispersd my fear when dazd with that excess to converse urgd and spake behooves thee sift more narrowly thy terms and say who leveld at this scope thy bow philosophy said i hath arguments and this place hath authority enough t imprint in me such love for of constraint good inasmuch as we perceive the good kindles our love and in degree the more as it comprises more of goodness in t the essence then where such advantage is that each good found without it is naught else but of his light the beam must needs attract the soul of each one loving who the truth discerns on which this proof is built such truth learn i from him who shows me the first love of all intelligential substances eternal from his voice i learn whose word is truth that of himself to moses saith i will make all my good before thee pass lastly from thee i learn who chief proclaimst een at the outset of thy heralding in mortal ears the mystery of heavn through human wisdom and th authority therewith agreeing heard i answerd keep the choicest of thy love for god but say if thou yet other cords within thee feelst that draw thee towards him so that thou report how many are the fangs with which this love is grappled to thy soul i did not miss to what intent the eagle of our lord had pointed his demand yea noted well th avowal which he led to and resumd all grappling bonds that knit the heart to god confederate to make fast our clarity the being of the world and mine own being the death which he endurd that i should live and that which all the faithful hope as i do to the forementiond lively knowledge joind have from the sea of ill love savd my bark and on the coast securd it of the right as for the leaves that in the garden bloom my love for them is great as is the good dealt by th eternal hand that tends them all i ended and therewith a song most sweet rang through the spheres and holy holy holy accordant with the rest my lady sang and as a sleep is broken and dispersd through sharp encounter of the nimble light with the eyes spirit running forth to meet the ray from membrane on to the membrane urgd and the upstartled wight loathes that he sees so at his sudden waking he misdeems of all around him till assurance waits on better judgment thus the saintly came drove from before mine eyes the motes away with the resplendence of her own that cast their brightness downward thousand miles below whence i my vision clearer shall before recoverd and well nigh astounded askd of a fourth light that now with us i saw and beatrice the first diving soul that ever the first virtue framd admires within these rays his maker like the leaf that bows its lithe top till the blast is blown by its own virtue reard then stands aloof so i the whilst she said awestricken bowd then eagerness to speak emboldend me and i began o fruit that wast alone mature when first engenderd ancient father that doubly seest in every wedded bride thy daughter by affinity and blood devoutly as i may i pray thee hold converse with me my will thou seest and i more speedily to hear thee tell it not it chanceth oft some animal bewrays through the sleek covring of his furry coat the fondness that stirs in him and conforms his outside seeming to the cheer within and in like guise was adams spirit movd to joyous mood that through the covering shone transparent when to pleasure me it spake no need thy will be told which i untold better discern than thou whatever thing thou holdst most certain for that will i see in him who is truths mirror and himself parhelion unto all things and naught else to him this wouldst thou hear how long since god placd me high garden from whose hounds she led me up in this ladder steep and long what space endurd my season of delight whence truly sprang the wrath that banishd me and what the language which i spake and framd not that i tasted of the tree my son was in itself the cause of that exile but only my transgressing of the mark assignd me there whence at thy ladys hest the mantuan movd him still was i debarrd this council till the sun had made complete four thousand and three hundred rounds and twice his annual journey and through every light in his broad pathway saw i him return thousand save sevnty times the whilst i dwelt upon the earth the language i did use was worn away or ever nimrods race their unaccomplishable work began for naught that man inclines to ere was lasting left by his reason free and variable as is the sky that sways him that he speaks is natures prompting whether thus or thus she leaves to you as ye do most affect it ere i descended into hells abyss el was the name on earth of the chief good whose joy enfolds me eli then t was calld and so beseemeth for in mortals use is as the leaf upon the bough that goes and other comes instead upon the mount most high above the waters all my life both innocent and guilty did but reach from the first hour to that which cometh next as the sun changes quarter to the sixth canto xxvii then glory to the father to the son and to the holy spirit rang aloud throughout all paradise that with the song my spirit reeld so passing sweet the strain and what i saw was equal ecstasy one universal smile it seemd of all things joy past compare gladness unutterable imperishable life of peace and love exhaustless riches and unmeasurd bliss before mine eyes stood the four torches lit and that which first had come began to wax in brightness and in semblance such became as jove might be if he and mars were birds and interchangd their plumes silence ensued through the blest quire by him who here appoints vicissitude of ministry enjoind when thus i heard wonder not if my hue be changd for while i speak these shalt thou see all in like manner change with me my place he who usurps on earth my place ay mine which in the presence of the son of god is void the same hath made my cemetery a common sewer of puddle and of blood the more below his triumph who from hence malignant fell such colour as the sun at eve or morning paints an adverse cloud then saw i sprinkled over all the sky and as th unblemishd dame who in herself secure of censure yet at bare report of others failing shrinks with maiden fear so beatrice in her semblance changd and such eclipse in heavn methinks was seen when the most holy sufferd then the words proceeded with voice alterd from itself so clean the semblance did not alter more not to this end was christs spouse with my blood with that of linus and of cletus fed that she might serve for purchase of base gold but for the purchase of this happy life did sextus pius and callixtus bleed and urban they whose doom was not without much weeping seald no purpose was of our that on the right hand of our successors part of the christian people should be set and part upon their left nor that the keys which were vouchsafd me should for ensign serve unto the banners that do levy war on the baptizd nor i for sigilmark set upon sold and lying privileges which makes me oft to bicker and turn red in shepherds clothing greedy wolves below range wide oer all the pastures arm of god why longer sleepst thou caorsines and gascona prepare to quaff our blood o good beginning to what a vile conclusion must thou stoop but the high providence which did defend through scipio the worlds glory unto rome will not delay its succour and thou son who through thy mortal weight shall yet again return below open thy lips nor hide what is by me not hidden as a hood of frozen vapours streams adown the air what time the shegoat with her skiey horn touches the sun so saw i there stream wide the vapours who with us had lingerd late and with glad triumph deck th ethereal cope onward my sight their semblances pursued so far pursued as till the space between from its reach severd them whereat the guide celestial marking me no more intent on upward gazing said look down and see what circuit thou hast compassd from the hour when i before had cast my view beneath all the first region overpast i saw which from the midmost to the boundry winds that onward thence from gades i beheld the unwise passage of laertes son and hitherward the shore where thou europa madst thee a joyful burden and yet more of this dim spot had seen but that the sun a constellation off and more had taen his progress in the zodiac underneath then by the spirit that doth never leave its amorous dalliance with my ladys looks back with redoubled ardour were mine eyes led unto her and from her radiant smiles whenas i turnd me pleasure so divine did lighten on me that whatever bait or art or nature in the human flesh or in its limnd resemblance can combine through greedy eyes to take the soul withal were to her beauty nothing its boon influence from the fair nest of leda rapt me forth and wafted on into the swiftest heavn what place for entrance beatrice chose i may not say so uniform was all liveliest and loftiest she my secret wish divind and with such gladness that gods love seemd from her visage shining thus began here is the goal whence motion on his race starts motionless the centre and the rest all movd around except the soul divine place in this heavn is none the soul divine wherein the love which ruleth oer its orb is kindled and the virtue that it sheds one circle light and love enclasping it as this doth clasp the others and to him who draws the bound its limit only known measurd itself by none it doth divide motion to all counted unto them forth as by the fifth or half ye count forth ten the vase wherein times roots are plungd thou seest look elsewhere for the leaves o mortal lust that canst not lift thy head above the waves which whelm and sink thee down the will in man bears goodly blossoms but its ruddy promise is by the dripping of perpetual rain made mere abortion faith and innocence are met with but in babes each taking leave ere cheeks with down are sprinkled he that fasts while yet a stammerer with his tongue let loose gluts every food alike in every moon one yet a babbler loves and listens to his mother but no sooner hath free use of speech than he doth wish her in her grave so suddenly doth the fair child of him whose welcome is the morn and eve his parting to negro blackness change her virgin white thou to abate thy wonder note that none bears rule in earth and its frail family are therefore wandrers yet before the date when through the hundredth in his reckning drops pale january must be shord aside from winters calendar these heavnly spheres shall roar so loud that fortune shall be fain to turn the poop where she hath now the prow so that the fleet run onward and true fruit expected long shall crown at last the bloom canto xxviii so she who doth imparadise my soul had drawn the veil from off our pleasant life and bard the truth of poor mortality when lo as one who in a mirror spies the shining of a flambeau at his back lit sudden ore he deem of its approach and turneth to resolve him if the glass have told him true and sees the record faithful as note is to its metre even thus i well remember did befall to me looking upon the beauteous eyes whence love had made the leash to take me as i turnd and that which in their circles none who spies can miss of in itself apparent struck on mine a point i saw that darted light so sharp no lid unclosing may bear up against its keenness the least star we view from hence had seemd a moon set by its side as star by side of star and so far off perchance as is the halo from the light which paints it when most dense the vapour spreads there wheeld about the point a circle of fire more rapid than the motion which first girds the world then circle after circle round enringd each other till the seventh reachd circumference so ample that its bow within the span of junos messenger lied scarce been held entire beyond the sevnth followd yet other two and every one as more in number distant from the first was tardier in motion and that glowd with flame most pure that to the sparkle of truth was nearest as partaking most methinks of its reality the guide belovd saw me in anxious thought suspense and spake heavn and all nature hangs upon that point the circle thereto most conjoind observe and know that by intenser love its course is to this swiftness wingd to whom i thus it were enough nor should i further seek had i but witnessd order in the world appointed such as in these wheels is seen but in the sensible world such diffrence is that is each round shows more divinity as each is wider from the centre hence if in this wondrous and angelic temple that hath for confine only light and love my wish may have completion i must know wherefore such disagreement is between th exemplar and its copy for myself contemplating i fail to pierce the cause it is no marvel if thy fingers foild do leave the knot untied so hard t is grown for want of tenting thus she said but take she added if thou wish thy cure my words and entertain them subtly every orb corporeal doth proportion its extent unto the virtue through its parts diffusd the greater blessedness preserves the more the greater is the body if all parts share equally the more is to preserve therefore the circle whose swift course enwheels the universal frame answers to that which is supreme in knowledge and in love thus by the virtue not the seeming breadth of substance measure thou shalt see the heavns each to the intelligence that ruleth it greater to more and smaller unto less suited in strict and wondrous harmony as when the sturdy north blows from his cheek a blast that scours the sky forthwith our air cleard of the rack that hung on it before glitters and with his beauties all unveild the firmament looks forth serene and smiles such was my cheer when beatrice drove with clear reply the shadows back and truth was manifested as a star in heaven and when the words were ended not unlike to iron in the furnace every cirque ebullient shot forth scintillating fires and every sparkle shivering to new blaze in number did outmillion the account reduplicate upon the chequerd board then heard i echoing on from choir to choir hosanna to the fixed point that holds and shall for ever hold them to their place from everlasting irremovable musing awhile i stood and she who saw by inward meditations thus began in the first circles they whom thou beheldst are seraphim and cherubim thus swift follow their hoops in likeness to the point near as they can approaching and they can the more the loftier their vision those that round them fleet gazing the godhead next are thrones in whom the first trine ends and all are blessed even as their sight descends deeper into the truth wherein rest is for every mind thus happiness hath root in seeing not in loving which of sight is aftergrowth and of the seeing such the meed as unto each in due degree grace and goodwill their measure have assignd the other trine that with still opening buds in this eternal springtide blossom fair fearless of bruising from the nightly ram breathe up in warbled melodies threefold hosannas blending ever from the three transmitted hierarchy of gods for aye rejoicing dominations first next then virtues and powers the third the next to whom are princedoms and archangels with glad round to tread their festal ring and last the band angelical disporting in their sphere all as they circle in their orders look aloft and downward with such sway prevail that all with mutual impulse tend to god these once a mortal view beheld desire in dionysius so intently wrought that he as i have done rangd them and namd their orders marshald in his thought from him dissentient one refusd his sacred read but soon as in this heavn his doubting eyes were opend gregory at his error smild nor marvel that a denizen of earth should scan such secret truth for he had learnt both this and much beside of these our orbs from an eyewitness to heavns mysteries canto xxix no longer than what time latonas twins coverd of libra and the fleecy star together both girding the horizon hang in even balance from the zenith poisd till from that verge each changing hemisphere part the nice level een so brief a space did beatrices silence hold a smile bat painted on her cheek and her fixd gaze bent on the point at which my vision faild when thus her words resuming she began i speak nor what thou wouldst inquire demand for i have markd it where all time and place are present not for increase to himself of good which may not be increasd but forth to manifest his glory by its beams inhabiting his own eternity beyond times limit or what bound soeer to circumscribe his being as he willd into new natures like unto himself eternal love unfolded nor before as if in dull inaction torpid lay for not in process of before or aft upon these waters movd the spirit of god simple and mixd both form and substance forth to perfect being started like three darts shot from a bow threecorded and as ray in crystal glass and amber shines entire een at the moment of its issuing thus did from th eternal sovran beam entire his threefold operation at one act producd coeval yet in order each created his due station knew those highest who pure intelligence were made mere power the lowest in the midst bound with strict league intelligence and power unseverd bond long tract of ages by the angels past ere the creating of another world describd on jeromes pages thou hast seen but that what i disclose to thee is true those penmen whom the holy spirit movd in many a passage of their sacred book attest as thou by diligent search shalt find and reason in some sort discerns the same who scarce would grant the heavnly ministers of their perfection void so long a space thus when and where these spirits of love were made thou knowst and how and knowing hast allayd thy thirst which from the triple question rose ere one had reckond twenty een so soon part of the angels fell and in their fall confusion to your elements ensued the others kept their station and this task whereon thou lookst began with such delight that they surcease not ever day nor night their circling of that fatal lapse the cause was the curst pride of him whom thou hast seen pent with the worlds incumbrance those whom here thou seest were lowly to confess themselves of his free bounty who had made them apt for ministries so high therefore their views were by enlightning grace and their own merit exalted so that in their will confirmd they stand nor feel to fall for do not doubt but to receive the grace which heavn vouchsafes is meritorious even as the soul with prompt affection welcometh the guest now without further help if with good heed my words thy mind have treasurd thou henceforth this consistory round about mayst scan and gaze thy fill but since thou hast on earth heard vain disputers reasoners in the schools canvas the angelic nature and dispute its powers of apprehension memory choice therefore t is well thou take from me the truth pure and without disguise which they below equivocating darken and perplex know thou that from the first these substances rejoicing in the countenance of god have held unceasingly their view intent upon the glorious vision from the which naught absent is nor hid where then no change of newness with succession interrupts remembrance there needs none to gather up divided thought and images remote so that men thus at variance with the truth dream though their eyes be open reckless some of error others well aware they err to whom more guilt and shame are justly due each the known track of sage philosophy deserts and has a byway of his own so much the restless eagerness to shine and love of singularity prevail yet this offensive as it is provokes heavns anger less than when the book of god is forcd to yield to mans authority or from its straightness warpd no reckning made what blood the sowing of it in the world has cost what favour for himself he wins who meekly clings to it the aim of all is how to shine een they whose office is to preach the gospel let the gospel sleep and pass their own inventions off instead one tells how at christs suffering the wan moon bent back her steps and shadowd oer the sun with intervenient disk as she withdrew another how the light shrouded itself within its tabernacle and left dark the spaniard and the indian with the jew such fables florence in her pulpit hears bandied about more frequent than the names of bindi and of lapi in her streets the sheep meanwhile poor witless ones return from pasture fed with wind and what avails for their excuse they do not see their harm christ said not to his first conventicle go forth and preach impostures to the world but gave them truth to build on and the sound was mighty on their lips nor needed they beside the gospel other spear or shield to aid them in their warfare for the faith the preacher now provides himself with store of jests and gibes and so there be no lack of laughter while he vents them his big cowl distends and he has won the meed he sought could but the vulgar catch a glimpse the while of that dark bird which nestles in his hood they scarce would wait to hear the blessing said which now the dotards hold in such esteem that every counterfeit who spreads abroad the hands of holy promise finds a throng of credulous fools beneath saint anthony fattens with this his swine and others worse than swine who diet at his lazy board paying with unstampd metal for their fare but for we far have wanderd let us seek the forward path again so as the way be shortend with the time no mortal tongue nor thought of man hath ever reachd so far that of these natures he might count the tribes what daniel of their thousands hath reveald with finite number infinite conceals the fountain at whose source these drink their beams with light supplies them in as many modes as there are splendours that it shines on each according to the virtue it conceives differing in love and sweet affection look then how lofty and how huge in breadth the eternal might which broken and dispersd over such countless mirrors yet remains whole in itself and one as at the first canto xxx noons fervid hour perchance six thousand miles from hence is distant and the shadowy cone almost to level on our earth declines when from the midmost of this blue abyss by turns some star is to our vision lost and straightway as the handmaid of the sun puts forth her radiant brow all light by light fade and the spangled firmament shuts in een to the loveliest of the glittering throng thus vanishd gradually from my sight the triumph which plays ever round the point that overcame me seeming for it did engirt by that it girdeth wherefore love with loss of other object forcd me bend mine eyes on beatrice once again if all that hitherto is told of her were in one praise concluded t were too weak to furnish out this turn mine eyes did look on beauty such as i believe in sooth not merely to exceed our human but that save its maker none can to the full enjoy it at this point oerpowerd i fail unequal to my theme as never bard of buskin or of sock hath faild before for as the sun doth to the feeblest sight een so remembrance of that witching smile hath dispossess my spirit of itself not from that day when on this earth i first beheld her charms up to that view of them have i with song applausive ever ceasd to follow but not follow them no more my course here bounded as each artists is when it doth touch the limit of his skill she such as i bequeath her to the bruit of louder trump than mine which hasteneth on urging its arduous matter to the close her words resumd in gesture and in voice resembling one accustomd to command forth from the last corporeal are we come into the heavn that is unbodied light light intellectual replete with love love of true happiness replete with joy joy that transcends all sweetness of delight here shalt thou look on either mighty host of paradise and one in that array which in the final judgment thou shalt see as when the lightning in a sudden spleen unfolded dashes from the blinding eyes the visive spirits dazzled and bedimmd so round about me fulminating streams of living radiance playd and left me swathd and veild in dense impenetrable blaze such weal is in the love that stills this heavn for its own flame the torch this fitting ever no sooner to my listning ear had come the brief assurance than i understood new virtue into me infusd and sight kindled afresh with vigour to sustain excess of light however pure i lookd and in the likeness of a river saw light flowing from whose amberseeming waves flashd up effulgence as they glided on twixt banks on either side painted with spring incredible how fair and from the tide there ever and anon outstarting flew sparkles instinct with life and in the flowrs did set them like to rubies chasd in gold then as if drunk with odors plungd again into the wondrous flood from which as one reenterd still another rose the thirst of knowledge high whereby thou art inflamd to search the meaning of what here thou seest the more it warms thee pleases me the more but first behooves thee of this water drink or ere that longing be allayd so spake the daystar of mine eyes then thus subjoind this stream and these forth issuing from its gulf and diving back a living topaz each with all this laughter on its bloomy shores are but a preface shadowy of the truth they emblem not that in themselves the things are crude but on thy part is the defect for that thy views not yet aspire so high never did babe that had outslept his wont rush with such eager straining to the milk as i toward the water bending me to make the better mirrors of mine eyes in the refining wave and as the eaves of mine eyelids did drink of it forthwith seemd it unto me turnd from length to round then as a troop of maskers when they put their vizors off look other than before the counterfeited semblance thrown aside so into greater jubilee were changd those flowers and sparkles and distinct i saw before me either court of heavn displacd o prime enlightener thou who cravst me strength on the high triumph of thy realm to gaze grant virtue now to utter what i kennd there is in heavn a light whose goodly shine makes the creator visible to all created that in seeing him alone have peace and in a circle spreads so far that the circumference were too loose a zone to girdle in the sun all is one beam reflected from the summit of the first that moves which being hence and vigour takes and as some cliff that from the bottom eyes its image mirrord in the crystal flood as if t admire its brave appareling of verdure and of flowers so round about eyeing the light on more than million thrones stood eminent whatever from our earth has to the skies returnd how wide the leaves extended to their utmost of this rose whose lowest step embosoms such a space of ample radiance yet nor amplitude nor height impeded but my view with ease took in the full dimensions of that joy near or remote what there avails where god immediate rules and nature awed suspends her sway into the yellow of the rose perennial which in bright expansiveness lays forth its gradual blooming redolent of praises to the neverwintring sun as one who fain would speak yet holds his peace beatrice led me and behold she said this fair assemblage stoles of snowy white how numberless the city where we dwell behold how vast and these our seats so throngd few now are wanting here in that proud stall on which the crown already oer its state suspended holds thine eyesor ere thyself mayst at the wedding supshall rest the soul of the great harry he who by the world augustas haild to italy must come before her day be ripe but ye are sick and in your tetchy wantonness as blind as is the bantling that of hunger dies and drives away the nurse nor may it be that he who in the sacred forum sways openly or in secret shall with him accordant walk whom god will not endure i th holy office long but thrust him down to simon magus where magnas priest will sink beneath him such will be his meed canto xxxi in fashion as a snowwhite rose lay then before my view the saintly multitude which in his own blood christ espousd meanwhile that other host that soar aloft to gaze and celebrate his glory whom they love hoverd around and like a troop of bees amid the vernal sweets alighting now now clustering where their fragrant labour glows flew downward to the mighty flowr or rose from the redundant petals streaming back unto the steadfast dwelling of their joy faces had they of flame and wings of gold the rest was whiter than the driven snow and as they flitted down into the flower from range to range fanning their plumy loins whisperd the peace and ardour which they won from that soft winnowing shadow none the vast interposition of such numerous flight cast from above upon the flower or view obstructed aught for through the universe wherever merited celestial light glides freely and no obstacle prevents all there who reign in safety and in bliss ages long past or new on one sole mark their love and vision fixd o trinal beam of individual star that charmst them thus vouchsafe one glance to gild our storm below if the grim brood from arctic shores that roamd where helice forever as she wheels sparkles a mothers fondness on her son stood in mute wonder mid the works of rome when to their view the lateran arose in greatness more than earthly i who then from human to divine had past from time unto eternity and out of florence to justice and to truth how might i choose but marvel too twixt gladness and amaze in sooth no will had i to utter aught or hear and as a pilgrim when he rests within the temple of his vow looks round in breathless awe and hopes some time to tell of all its goodly state een so mine eyes coursd up and down along the living light now low and now aloft and now around visiting every step looks i beheld where charity in soft persuasion sat smiles from within and radiance from above and in each gesture grace and honour high so rovd my ken and its general form all paradise surveyd when round i turnd with purpose of my lady to inquire once more of things that held my thought suspense but answer found from other than i weend for beatrice when i thought to see i saw instead a senior at my side robd as the rest in glory joy benign glowd in his eye and oer his cheek diffusd with gestures such as spake a fathers love and whither is she vanishd straight i askd by beatrice summond he replied i come to aid thy wish looking aloft to the third circle from the highest there behold her on the throne wherein her merit hath placd her answering not mine eyes i raisd and saw her where aloof she sat her brow a wreath reflecting of eternal beams not from the centre of the sea so far unto the region of the highest thunder as was my ken from hers and yet the form came through that medium down unmixd and pure o lady thou in whom my hopes have rest who for my safety hast not scornd in hell to leave the traces of thy footsteps markd for all mine eyes have seen i to thy power and goodness virtue owe and grace of slave thou hast to freedom brought me and no means for my deliverance apt hast left untried thy liberal bounty still toward me keep that when my spirit which thou madest whole is loosend from this body it may find favour with thee so i my suit preferrd and she so distant as appeard lookd down and smild then towrds th eternal fountain turnd and thus the senior holy and reverd that thou at length mayst happily conclude thy voyage to which end i was dispatchd by supplication movd and holy love let thy upsoaring vision range at large this garden through for so by ray divine kindled thy ken a higher flight shall mount and from heavns queen whom fervent i adore all gracious aid befriend us for that i am her own faithful bernard like a wight who haply from croatia wends to see our veronica and the while t is shown hangs over it with neversated gaze and all that he hath heard revolving saith unto himself in thought and didst thou look een thus o jesus my true lord and god and was this semblance thine so gazd i then adoring for the charity of him who musing in the world that peace enjoyd stood lively before me child of grace thus he began thou shalt not knowledge gain of this glad being if thine eyes are held still in this depth below but search around the circles to the furthest till thou spy seated in state the queen that of this realm is sovran straight mine eyes i raisd and bright as at the birth of morn the eastern clime above th horizon where the sun declines to mine eyes that upward as from vale to mountain sped at th extreme bound a part excelld in lustre all the front opposd and as the glow burns ruddiest oer the wave that waits the sloping beam which phaeton ill knew to guide and on each part the light diminishd fades intensest in the midst so burnd the peaceful oriflame and slackd on every side the living flame decayd and in that midst their sportive pennons wavd thousands of angels in resplendence each distinct and quaint adornment at their glee and carol smild the lovely one of heavn that joy was in the eyes of all the blest had i a tongue in eloquence as rich as is the colouring in fancys loom t were all too poor to utter the least part of that enchantment when he saw mine eyes intent on her that charmd him bernard gazd with so exceeding fondness as infusd ardour into my breast unfelt before canto xxxii freely the sage though wrapt in musings high assumd the teachers part and mild began the wound that mary closd she opend first who sits so beautiful at marys feet the third in order underneath her lo rachel with beatrice sarah next judith rebecca and the gleaner maid meek ancestress of him who sang the songs of sore repentance in his sorrowful mood all as i name them down from deaf to leaf are in gradation throned on the rose and from the seventh step successively adown the breathing tresses of the flowr still doth the file of hebrew dames proceed for these are a partition wall whereby the sacred stairs are severd as the faith in christ divides them on this part where blooms each leaf in full maturity are set such as in christ or ere he came believd on th other where an intersected space yet shows the semicircle void abide all they who lookd to christ already come and as our lady on her glorious stool and they who on their stools beneath her sit this way distinction make een so on his the mighty baptist that way marks the line he who endurd the desert and the pains of martyrdom and for two years of hell yet still continued holy and beneath augustin francis benedict and the rest thus far from round to round so heavns decree forecasts this garden equally to fill with faith in either view past or to come learn too that downward from the step which cleaves midway the twain compartments none there are who place obtain for merit of their own but have through others merit been advancd on set conditions spirits all releasd ere for themselves they had the power to choose and if thou mark and listen to them well their childish looks and voice declare as much here silent as thou art i know thy doubt and gladly will i loose the knot wherein thy subtle thoughts have bound thee from this realm excluded chalice no entrance here may find no more shall hunger thirst or sorrow can a law immutable hath establishd all nor is there aught thou seest that doth not fit exactly as the finger to the ring it is not therefore without cause that these oerspeedy comers to immortal life are different in their shares of excellence our sovran lordthat settleth this estate in love and in delight so absolute that wish can dare no furtherevery soul created in his joyous sight to dwell with grace at pleasure variously endows and for a proof th effect may well suffice and t is moreover most expressly markd in holy scripture where the twins are said to have struggled in the womb therefore as grace inweaves the coronet so every brow weareth its proper hue of orient light and merely in respect to his prime gift not in reward of meritorious deed hath each his several degree assignd in early times with their own innocence more was not wanting than the parents faith to save them those first ages past behoovd that circumcision in the males should imp the flight of innocent wings but since the day of grace hath come without baptismal rites in christ accomplishd innocence herself must linger yet below now raise thy view unto the visage most resembling christ for in her splendour only shalt thou win the powr to look on him forthwith i saw such floods of gladness on her visage showerd from holy spirits winging that profound that whatsoever i had yet beheld had not so much suspended me with wonder or shown me such similitude of god and he who had to her descended once on earth now haild in heavn and on poisd wing ave maria gratia plena sang to whose sweet anthem all the blissful court from all parts answring rang that holier joy brooded the deep serene father reverd who deignst for me to quit the pleasant place wherein thou sittest by eternal lot say who that angel is that with such glee beholds our queen and so enamourd glows of her high beauty that all fire he seems so i again resorted to the lore of my wise teacher he whom marys charms embellishd as the sun the morning star who thus in answer spake in him are summd whatever of buxomness and free delight may be in spirit or in angel met and so beseems for that he bare the palm down unto mary when the son of god vouchsafd to clothe him in terrestrial weeds now let thine eyes wait heedful on my words and note thou of this just and pious realm the chiefest nobles those highest in bliss the twain on each hand next our empress thrond are as it were two roots unto this rose he to the left the parent whose rash taste proves bitter to his seed and on the right that ancient father of the holy church into whose keeping christ did give the keys of this sweet flowr near whom behold the seer that ere he died saw all the grievous times of the fair bride who with the lance and nails was won and near unto the other rests the leader under whom on manna fed th ungrateful nation fickle and perverse on th other part facing to peter lo where anna sits so well content to look on her lovd daughter that with moveless eye she chants the loud hosanna while opposd to the first father of your mortal kind is lucia at whose hest thy lady sped when on the edge of ruin closd thine eye but for the vision hasteneth so an end here break we off as the good workman doth that shapes the cloak according to the cloth and to the primal love our ken shall rise that thou mayst penetrate the brightness far as sight can bear thee yet alas in sooth beating thy pennons thinking to advance thou backward fallst grace then must first be gaind her grace whose might can help thee thou in prayer seek her and with affection whilst i sue attend and yield me all thy heart he said and thus the saintly orison began canto xxxiii o virgin mother daughter of thy son created beings all in lowliness surpassing as in height above them all term by th eternal counsel preordaind ennobler of thy nature so advancd in thee that its great maker did not scorn himself in his own work enclosd to dwell for in thy womb rekindling shone the love reveald whose genial influence makes now this flower to germin in eternal peace here thou to us of charity and love art as the noonday torch and art beneath to mortal men of hope a living spring so mighty art thou lady and so great that he who grace desireth and comes not to thee for aidance fain would have desire fly without wings nor only him who asks thy bounty succours but doth freely oft forerun the asking whatsoeer may be of excellence in creature pity mild relenting mercy large munificence are all combind in thee here kneeleth one who of all spirits hath reviewd the state from the worlds lowest gap unto this height suppliant to thee he kneels imploring grace for virtue yet more high to lift his ken toward the bliss supreme and i who neer coveted sight more fondly for myself than now for him my prayers to thee prefer and pray they be not scant that thou wouldst drive each cloud of his mortality away that on the sovran pleasure he may gaze this also i entreat of thee o queen who canst do what thou wilt that in him thou wouldst after all he hath beheld preserve affection sound and human passions quell lo where with beatrice many a saint stretch their claspd hands in furtherance of my suit the eyes that heavn with love and awe regards fixd on the suitor witnessd how benign she looks on pious prayrs then fastend they on th everlasting light wherein no eye of creature as may well be thought so far can travel inward i meanwhile who drew near to the limit where all wishes end the ardour of my wish for so behooved ended within me beckning smild the sage that i should look aloft but ere he bade already of myself aloft i lookd for visual strength refining more and more bare me into the ray authentical of sovran light thenceforward what i saw was not for words to speak nor memorys self to stand against such outrage on her skill as one who from a dream awakend straight all he hath seen forgets yet still retains impression of the feeling in his dream een such am i for all the vision dies as t were away and yet the sense of sweet that sprang from it still trickles in my heart thus in the sunthaw is the snow unseald thus in the winds on flitting leaves was lost the sybils sentence o eternal beam whose height what reach of mortal thought may soar yield me again some little particle of what thou then appearedst give my tongue power but to leave one sparkle of thy glory unto the race to come that shall not lose thy triumph wholly if thou waken aught of memory in me and endure to hear the record sound in this unequal strain such keenness from the living ray i met that if mine eyes had turnd away methinks i had been lost but so emboldend on i passd as i remember till my view hoverd the brink of dread infinitude o grace unenvying of thy boon that gavst boldness to fix so earnestly my ken on th everlasting splendour that i lookd while sight was unconsumd and in that depth saw in one volume claspd of love whatever the universe unfolds all properties of substance and of accident beheld compounded yet one individual light the whole and of such bond methinks i saw the universal form for that whenever i do but speak of it my soul dilates beyond her proper self and till i speak one moment seems a longer lethargy than fiveandtwenty ages had appeard to that emprize that first made neptune wonder at argos shadow darkening on his flood with fixed heed suspense and motionless wondring i gazd and admiration still was kindled as i gazd it may not be that one who looks upon that light can turn to other object willingly his view for all the good that will may covet there is summd and all elsewhere defective found complete my tongue shall utter now no more een what remembrance keeps than could the babes that yet is moistend at his mothers breast not that the semblance of the living light was changd that ever as at first remaind but that my vision quickening in that sole appearance still new miracles descryd and toild me with the change in that abyss of radiance clear and lofty seemd methought three orbs of triple hue clipt in one bound and from another one reflected seemd as rainbow is from rainbow and the third seemd fire breathd equally from both oh speech how feeble and how faint art thou to give conception birth yet this to what i saw is less than little oh eternal light sole in thyself that dwellst and of thyself sole understood past present or to come thou smiledst on that circling which in thee seemd as reflected splendour while i musd for i therein methought in its own hue beheld our image painted steadfastly i therefore pord upon the view as one who versd in geometric lore would fain measure the circle and though pondering long and deeply that beginning which he needs finds not een such was i intent to scan the novel wonder and trace out the form how to the circle fitted and therein how placd but the flight was not for my wing had not a flash darted athwart my mind and in the spleen unfolded what it sought here
