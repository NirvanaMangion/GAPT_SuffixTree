                     camp fires and camp cooking 


in making up the following receipts  the author has been actuated by a
desire to aid the efforts of those of his countrymen who  with the best
intentions  lack the knowledge to utilize them  and having personally
assisted in the concoction of the various dishes he treats of  using
only camp fires  camp kettles  and soldiers  rations  he knows that a
little attention on the part of any sensible man  and none other should
ever attempt to cook  will produce the most savory and gratifying
results 


                    camp cooking and camp kettles 

the utensils and means furnished by government to the soldier for
preparing his food are of the most primitive character  the former
consist of camp kettles  made of iron  with a handle  and varying in
size from four to seven gallons   they should be made so as to have one
slide into the other  in nests of four   and mess pans  also of iron 
about    inches in diameter  and sloping to the bottom  the latter
consist of a certain amount of wood per diem  which is to be consumed
as taste or ingenuity may dictate  the usual and most simple mode is to
dig a trench    inches wide     inches deep  and from four to six feet
long  at each end plant a forked stick of equal height  with a stout
sapling  from which to suspend the kettles  extending from one to the
other

this  however  is neither the best nor most economical mode  as
it consumes much fuel  wastes much of the heat  and causes great
inconvenience to the cook  an improvement can be effected by casing the
sides of the trench with brick  adding a little chimney at one end 
and  in place of the forked sticks  using iron uprights and cross bar 
to which half a dozen hooks for hanging kettles are attached

in a clayey soil  the plan adopted by the salt boilers of new york is
perhaps the neatest  most economical  and most convenient that can
be devised  they dig a hole about three feet square and two feet in
depth  generally in the slope of a hill  on one side they run a shaft
laterally  about one foot square and six feet in length  and one foot
from the surface of the ground  at the extreme end they sink a shaft
vertically  and form a chimney  and at equi distances they pierce three
holes of sufficient diameter to prevent the kettles from slipping
through  by this mode the kettles can be placed over the fire to
boil  or on either side  to simmer  with less difficulty than by any
other means

besides the allowance from government  however  the company cooks
should be furnished  from the  company fund   with two large iron
spoons  two large iron forks  two stout knives  one tin cullender and
one yard of flannel  also a false tin bottom  closely fitting the
kettles  for all of which the cook should be responsible 


                              the ration 

no army in the world is so well provided for  in the shape of food 
either as to quantity or quality  as the army of the united states  and
very little attention on the part of the cook will enable him to lay up
a liberal amount weekly to the credit of the company fund  no one man
can consume his daily ration  although many waste it  and a systematic
issue will  in a great measure  prevent unnecessary extravagance 


                           the cook s creed 

cleanliness is next to godliness  both in persons and kettles  be ever
industrious  then  in scouring your pots  much elbow grease  a few
ashes  and a little water  are capital aids to the careful cook  better
wear out your pans with scouring than your stomachs with purging  and
it is less dangerous to work your elbows than your comrade s bowels 
dirt and grease betray the poor cook  and destroy the poor soldier 
whilst health  content  and good cheer should ever reward him who does
his duty and keeps his kettles clean  in military life  punctuality is
not only a duty  but a necessity  and the cook should always endeavor
to be exact in time  be sparing with sugar and salt  as a deficiency
can be better remedied than an overplus 


                          kitchen philosophy 

remember that beans  badly boiled  kill more than bullets  and fat is
more fatal than powder  in cooking  more than in anything else in this
world  always make haste slowly  one hour too much is vastly better
than five minutes too little  with rare exceptions  a big fire scorches
your soup  burns your face  and crisps your temper  skim  simmer  and
scour  are the true secrets of good cooking 


              beef soup with desiccated mixed vegetables 

the americans  as a rule  are not fond of soups  unless of the thicker
kind  but in no form can meat and vegetables be served together more
profitably and more nourishingly  as a matter of economy  it admits
of no argument  because every portion is useful  both bone and flesh 
and  when properly made  it is wholesome and palatable  on fresh beef
day  if among the rations there are some choice bits  such as sirloin 
tenderloin  or rump steaks  cut them into neat slices  and use for
breakfast  broiling them if it can be done  if not  fry them  save all
the bones  if large cut them in pieces and distribute equally among
the kettles  if the company numbers seventy men or less  use one large
kettle and two smaller ones  fill them nearly with pieces of meat 
from one to three pounds each  not too closely packed  then add water
enough to cover it  and place it over a brisk fire  throwing in a large
handful of salt to each kettle  as soon as the water begins to boil 
and the scum begins to rise  deaden the fire  and skim  carefully and
faithfully  every ten minutes  and be very sure that the water does
not again come to a boil   it should only simmer   for when the
meat is boiling hard the pores of the flesh are immediately closed 
the essence of the meat  and all its impurities  are retained within 
no scum arises  the meat becomes hard and tough  and the soup thin and
watery  if it is only permitted to simmer  the pores are kept open 
the blood is drawn out  the juices are extracted  the meat is rendered
tender and wholesome  and the soup rich  nutritious  and palatable 
in one hour and a half  carefully skimming all the while  the meat
should be done  but if it has only simmered  two hours will be better 
then take the meat out  leaving only the bones  an hour previous to
this  however  break up a tablet of desiccated vegetables as small as
possible  and divide them into as many portions as there are kettles of
soup  place each portion in a separate pan  and fill with fresh clean
water  standing them near the fire until thoroughly saturated with
water  when the meat is taken out  put the vegetables in  and let them
boil gently two hours longer  during that time carefully skimming off
all the fat which rises to the surface  then season with pepper and
salt  and a tablespoonful of vinegar  and serve out 

both the french and american desiccated vegetables come in tablets 
the former being twice as large as the latter  it will therefore be
necessary to use one of the french or two of the american tablets for
a company  which will be found amply sufficient  as they swell up to
sixteen times their bulk in a compressed state 

the fat taken from the soup is valuable  first for selling  next for
frying  but principally because you don t swallow it in your soup 


                      pork soup with vegetables 

this soup is good for a change  and quite economical  take four pounds
of clear pork  without rind or bone  cut it into pieces about one inch
square  put into a pan a little fat  which must be as hot as possible 
and throw in enough pork to cover the bottom  which is to be fried
quite brown  and turned into another pan whilst the balance is being
fried  have three camp kettles filled with clean water  boil it  and
add to each kettle one third of the fried pork  with a handful of salt 
let it boil moderately for fifteen minutes  and in the meanwhile 
having soaked the desiccated vegetables  add one third to each kettle 
and continue boiling  not too fast  for one hour and a half  season
with pepper  salt  and a little vinegar  and if there is any stale
bread to be had  three or four loaves should be cut into pieces two
inches square  or less  and divided equally in the three kettles  after
fifteen minutes  slow boiling the soup is ready to serve  whatever
fat floats on the top  before the bread is added  should be carefully
removed 


                               pea soup 

for some unexplained reason  this article is by no means popular with
the troops  and large quantities are constantly returned to the
commissary as company savings  this  it is believed  would not be the
case if the proper mode of cooking them was known  as they are not
only quite as nutritious as beans  but have always been considered by
epicures much more delicate 

to use them properly  they should first be washed  then boiled for at
least one hour  in a kettle with a false bottom  for a company  seven
or eight quarts should be boiled in double the quantity of water  in
default of a false bottom  they must be constantly stirred  to prevent
scorching  when quite soft  strain off the water  divide them into
three or four portions  according to the number of the kettles  and add
them to the pork soup  previously described  instead of the desiccated
vegetables  adding at the same time two large onions  sliced  to each
kettle  let it boil slowly for two hours  skimming now and then  and
before serving out  season liberally with black pepper  some salt  and
a dash of vinegar  they should be well mashed with a pounder before
serving 


                      boiled pork and bean soup 

never serve beans until they have been soaked over night  at eight
o clock in the morning  put eight quarts into two kettles  and fill up
with clean cold water  boil constantly  over a brisk fire  for an hour
or more  during which many of the beans will rise to the top  at the
end of this time  take the kettles off the fire for fifteen or twenty
minutes  and then pour off all the water  replacing it with fresh clean
water  add to each kettle a pound of parboiled pork  without rind  and
boil continuously for an hour and a half longer 

at quarter past eight o clock  fill three kettles loosely with pieces
of pork weighing from three to five pounds  cover with water  and
boil briskly for one hour  then pour off all the liquid  and fill up
with clean  hot  water  and boil for one hour and a half longer 
then take out all the pork  and lay it aside  take out also one half
of the beans from the other kettles  placing them aside for breakfast
next morning  and add to the remainder the liquor in which the pork
was boiled  to each kettle add also two onions chopped or sliced 
with plenty of black or red pepper  some salt  and a tablespoonful of
vinegar  after fifteen minutes  longer boiling  mash the beans with a
wooden stick made for the purpose  and serve  with a slice of pork  in
a separate dish 

if onions are plenty  mince fine eight or ten of them  fry them in a
pan with a little flour and fat  with half a pint hot water  and the
same quantity of the liquor in which the pork was boiled  after cooking
five minutes  add pepper  salt  and half a glass of vinegar  and pour
over the slices of pork 


                         beans for breakfast 

the beans left from the soup of the day before should be put in pans
and warmed over the fire  care being taken to prevent them from
scorching  in the meanwhile a few onions  say three or four  should be
chopped fine and slightly fried  and then strewed over the beans  with
pepper and salt  and a tablespoonful of vinegar  in this way they make
a first rate dish for breakfast or supper with bread and coffee 


                            to boil hominy 

whatever be the size of the kettle  fill it half full of hominy 
covering it with water so as nearly to fill it to the top  throw in a
handful of salt  and boil it  over a  very moderate  fire  for at
 least  an hour  stirring it constantly to prevent scorching 


                            to fry hominy 

should you have too much of it boiled for one meal  place the balance
in shallow dishes  mess pans being the handiest  and let it grow cold 
when it is to be used  cut it into slices about half an inch thick and
three inches long  have your fat as hot as fire can make it  then slip
your slices into it  and fry it until it obtains a golden brown color
on both sides  when you take it out  lay it on cloths  and let the fat
drain off  and  when serving  sprinkle a little salt over it 


                              beef stew 

take the pieces of beef reserved for frying or broiling  and cut them
into pieces about two inches square and one inch thick  sprinkle them
with pepper and salt  and put them into frying pans  with a little
fat  place them over the fire until half cooked  then turn them into
camp kettles  adding a handful of flour and six onions cut in quarters
to each kettle  with just enough cold water to cover the meat  add
also to each kettle two dozen potatoes pared and cut in quarters  stew
slowly over a moderate fire  skimming every now and then  for three
hours and a half  then stir in each two tablespoonsful of vinegar  and
serve smoking hot  all kinds of vegetables  such as leeks  carrots 
parsnips  and turnips  can be added to this stew with advantage 


                          bubble and squeak 

this is an old and favorite mode of getting rid of bits of corned beef
among good housewives at home  and can be advantageously introduced
into camp  any pieces of cold corned or salt beef that may be on hand
should be cut into slices and sprinkled with pepper  then put them in
a pan  with a little grease or fat  and fry them slightly  boil some
cabbage  and squeeze it quite dry  then cut it up very fine  and serve
a piece of beef with a spoonful of cabbage  first seasoning it with
pepper  salt  and vinegar 


                            brazilian stew 

take shins or legs of beef  cut them into slices or pieces two or three
ounces in weight  or about the size of an egg  dip them in vinegar 
and throw them into a kettle  with a dozen onions sliced   but no
water   let it stand over a very slow fire from three to four hours 
then season with pepper and salt  and serve hot  some boiled potatoes 
sliced or quartered  will be a great addition  but the principal thing
to be observed is that the fire be a moderate one 


                       corned beef and cabbage 

the salt beef furnished the army is of the very best character  rather
too highly impregnated with salt  perhaps  a fault easily remedied 
however  by soaking in fresh water over night  when about to boil it 
renew the water  which should be clean and cold  and place it over a
moderate fire for three hours and a half  skimming it carefully every
fifteen minutes  by this means only can the salt and blood be drawn
from it  and the meat rendered tender  after it has been on the fire
at least two hours  add as much cabbage as will fill the pot to each
kettle  taking out a portion of the water  so as to be able to get in
enough for the whole company  or dividing the meat into more kettles
if necessary  boil gently for an hour and a half after adding the
cabbage 


                            to cook bacon 

bacon should be well washed and scraped and put to soak all night  in
the morning  put it to boil slowly  simmering is better  after it has
once boiled  throw the water off and fill up with fresh water  then let
it simmer for three hours  when thoroughly done  the rind comes off
easily  and the meat tastes fresh and sweet 


                             frying bacon 

the great secret in frying is to have the fat as hot as fire will make
it before putting the article to be cooked into it  the object is to
close up the pores of the flesh at once  and prevent the fat from
penetrating it  rendering it greasy and indigestible  after the bacon
is well soaked  cut it into thin slices  and fry it crisp  if it is
cold bacon  slice it into a pan  cover it with bread crumbs  stale
bread grated  add very little fat  and put it over a quick fire for
four or five minutes  then turn it  and cook the other side 


                         bacon  german style 

when the bacon is parboiled  clean it thoroughly  taking off the rind
and all the bones  put it into clean pans  cutting it into strips  with
enough water to cover the bottom of the pan  place it in the oven  and
let it bake until the top is browned  basting it with the liquid in the
meanwhile to prevent its burning or becoming dry 


                           boiling potatoes 

every cook thinks he can cook potatoes  but the number that can cook
them well is very small  put the potatoes  with their skins on  into
the kettle  first washing them  then fill it with cold water  throw in
a handful of salt  and put it on the fire  when the water boils  throw
in a little cold water to check it  do so two or three times  when the
potatoes are very nearly cooked  pour off  all  the water  and
stand the kettle over the fire until the steam evaporates  if this
does not make them mealy it is the fault of the potatoes  the potatoes
should always be picked out of uniform size for each kettle  as they
boil more equally 


                            fried potatoes 

cut the vegetable into thin slices and throw them into cold water
for half an hour  then put them into fat  hissing hot   and fry
them until they acquire a golden hue  some persons cut them only into
quarters  but they are not near so crisp and nice 


                             to boil rice 

fill a camp kettle one third full of rice  well washed and cleaned 
and add water enough to fill within an inch of the top of the kettle 
let it boil gently  stirring constantly until the rice is quite soft 
if a false bottom for the kettle is used  all danger of burning the
rice will be avoided  if not  great care must be taken  to keep it
from scorching by constant stirring   when the rice is cooked 
turn the contents of the kettle into a cullender or coarse towel  and
pour rapidly through it a couple of pails of fresh cold water  let it
strain  and then put the rice in a clean kettle  which is placed near
the fire until the rice is quite dry  serve hot or cold  with molasses 
as may be most convenient 


                          to prepare coffee 

of all the articles of diet afforded the soldier none is more important
or popular than his coffee  the open tin pans used for roasting it are
singularly unfit  wasting  even when regularly burnt  the fragrance
or aroma  which forms the chief virtue of the drink  to obtain a
small roaster  coffee mill  and strainer  should be the first effort
of the cook  and the best outlay of the company fund  if  however 
circumstances prevent that  use what is given to the best advantage  in
roasting coffee  great care must be bestowed to prevent its burning 
to avoid this  some use a little fat  and others add a tablespoonful
of sugar  and all stir it constantly  over a very slow fire  when well
browned  cover immediately with a damp cloth  and allow it to cool 
then grind it  passing it through the mill twice  the kettles in which
it is to be prepared should be perfectly cleaned  and scoured inside
and out with ashes and hot water  scalding them before using  the water
should be fresh and perfectly clear  fill the kettles very nearly to
the top  and place them over a brisk fire to boil  whilst boiling 
throw in the coffee  which should be slightly moistened before with
warm  not hot  water  and  stirring it into the water  let it boil
up briskly for two minutes  then dash in a cup of cold fresh water 
and take it off the fire immediately  let it stand five minutes  to
allow the grains to settle  and then pass it slowly through a flannel
strainer into another kettle  from which it is served  by this mode
alone can the coffee be prevented from being impregnated with the dust
formed by grinding it  and make it palatable and wholesome  whatever
number of men may have to be served  measure out carefully so many
rations of water  adding five for lee way  so that it may lose nothing
in strength or quantity 


                             to make tea 

have the kettles as clean and as bright as they can be made  and let
the water be free from all impurities  boil it over a bright  clear
fire  and  when it boils briskly  add the tea  which should  one minute
previous  be slightly steeped in boiling water  in a perfectly covered
vessel  let it remain on the fire one minute  covering the kettle with
a clean pan  bottom upwards  or a close fitting cover with a very small
hole in it  then remove it  and stand it near the fire five minutes
before serving 


 to make bread in the  shiras oven   the portable field oven furnished
                    by the subsistence department 

it generally happens that every regiment numbers among its men one or
more bakers  but fearing this may not be universally the case  i add
a receipt written by a practical baker  frank m  lockwood  of the   d
regiment new york volunteers  whose bread has been frequently praised
by the general commanding the division  as well as many other officers
to whose notice it has been brought 

when on hand for distribution  any regiment can obtain three  shiras
ovens  on requisition to the chief of the commissariat  which will
be found amply sufficient to do the baking for     men  these ovens
are very simple  and can be quickly placed and easily removed 
the furniture and utensils necessary for kneading   c   are  one
dough trough and cover  one pin board  one peel  or wooden spade  one
sieve  one brush  short handled  two common knives  large size  two
large camp kettles  one yeast tub  two wooden pails  and one stove 
which can be made in the ground sufficiently convenient to answer the
purpose  of course a tent or hut must be erected  wherein to work and
keep the sponge warm 

to produce good bread requires good yeast  without which all efforts
are in vain  to effect this  your tubs must be faultlessly clean and
well scalded  and all your tins and kettles carefully scoured and free
from grease  using them  in fact  for nothing else 


                            to make yeast 

fill your kettle three fourths full of clean  clear water  place it
over a brisk fire  and  when it boils  add three good handsful of hops 
then put into your yeast tub four pounds of flour  and strain into it 
from the kettle  enough of the hot  hop water  to make a paste  working
it until it is perfectly free from lumps  by this time the hops in the
kettle will be sufficiently boiled  and must be strained into the yeast
tub and stirred with a wooden paddle until thoroughly amalgamated 
let it stand until it cools a little  about blood heat  and add three
pints of cracked malt and two quarts of stock yeast  mixing it all well
together to prevent any lumps remaining  and setting it away in some
quiet  warm place  where it will remain undisturbed for fifteen hours 
then it must be strained before using  care must be taken  always 
to keep enough on hand for stock for the next making 


                            to make bread 

the first process is to prepare the  ferment   this is formed by
boiling thoroughly a peck and a half of potatoes  with their skins
on  which you place in a barrel kept exclusively for that purpose 
adding six pounds of flour  and mashing them well together  this is
called  scalding the flour   then add cold water until it is cool
enough to enable you to put your hands in  and break up the potatoes
as fine as possible  so as to obtain all their virtue  then add about
six pailsful of warm water and six quarts of yeast  stir it well
together  and place it in a warm spot  where it will not be disturbed 
two good sized tubs  made of salt or sugar barrels  would be the best
receptacle for it  as it requires space to work in  this should be
made at night  and will be ready for use in the morning after it is
carefully strained 

the second process is making the dough  this is done by sifting into
the trough a barrel and a half of flour  one third of which is pinned
or blocked up at one end by the  pin board  or wooden slide  to this
you add three and a half pounds of salt and three and a half pailsful
of  ferment   with four pailsful of hot water  not so hot  however  as
to scald your ferment   in summer cold water is used instead of hot  
and mix well together  kneading thoroughly and faithfully  adding to it
gradually all the flour in the trough until it is of one consistency 
it must then be placed at one end of the trough  and again pinned in
by the slide  leaving space enough  however  to allow it to prove  to
effect this requires at least two hours  when it will be ready to  work
off   which is done by  throwing  it out of the trough  in masses  on
to the table or cover on the other side of the room or tent  it is then
cut into pieces and weighed  or  scaled off   and immediately moulded
into shapes or loaves  this requires one man to scale  one to form into
loaves  and a third to  pan it away   where it remains for at least
