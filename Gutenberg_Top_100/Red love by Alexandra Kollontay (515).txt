march second printing march authorized translation printed in the united states of america by j j little and ives company new york foreword to the english edition this novel is neither a study in morals nor a picture of the standard of life in soviet russia it is a purely psychological study of sex relations in the post war period i have chosen the environment of my own country and made my own people protagonists for i know them better and could give a more vivid picture of their inner life and characters many of the problems presented are not exclusively soviet russian they are world wide facts which can be noted in all countries these silent psychological dramas born of the change in the sexual relations this evolution especially in the feelings of women are well known to the younger generation of europe do we ever judge a man for his conduct in love affairs generally if he does not overstep certain very flexible limits we say that his sexual life is his own private affair the character of a man is evaluated not by his conduct in family morals but by his efficiency in work by his intellect his will his usefulness to the state and society as long as the majority of women had no direct duties to the state or to society as long as their whole activity was concentrated within the family limits civilized nations demanded no other qualities in woman than that she display good morals in sexual and family life now when more than half of the grown up women citizens in most countries toil and struggle just as the men do society puts new demands on the women their ability to respond to the social duties of a citizen begins to have more value than their goodness and stainlessness in family morals family life is not the unique field of activity for women nowadays often enough her family duties come into bitter conflict with her out of home work and her public duties it is only natural therefore that the method of evaluating a woman today is different from that of our grandfathers and grandmothers though a woman may at the present time attain perfection in the current bourgeois standard of family morals and be esteemed by her own people she may neither receive the real appreciation of society nor the respect of the state she will merely be overlooked on the contrary a woman may not be spotless from the point of view of current bourgeois sex morals but if she is an outstanding figure in politics art science etc one will not even whisper about her behind her back were one to put into the balance two women one with good morals but who never did any useful work for the country or humanity and the other whose family morals are not free from criticism but who is an efficient public worker there would be no doubt about the choice our criteria in sex morals are always changing there is never a standstill there are merely periods in human history when the evolution of morals goes on more rapidly other periods with a general stagnation in all fields of life when change seems to relax only half a century ago dumas fils wrote of a divorc e as of a fallen creature while today france openly discusses the question of equalizing the rights of non legal mothers with those of legally married women there remains less and less of the old bourgeois hypocrisy in our way of thinking and judging of sex morals i do hope that this book will aid in combating the old bourgeois hypocrisy in moral values and show once more that we are beginning to respect woman not for her good morals but for her efficiency for her ingenuity with respect to her duties toward her class her country and humanity as a whole mexico city march th contents part one love part two menage part three freedom love chapter i vassilissa was a working girl twenty eight years old a knitter by trade thin anemic a typical child of the city her hair cut short after typhus grew in curls from a distance she looked like a boy she was flat chested and wore a shirtwaist and a worn out leather belt she was not pretty but her eyes were beautiful brown friendly observant thoughtful eyes those eyes would never pass by another s sorrow she was a communist at the beginning of the war she had become a bolshevik she hated the war from the first collections had been made in the shop for the front people were ready to work overtime for the russian victory but vassilissa objected war was a bloody horror what was the good of it war brought hardships to the people and you felt so sorry for the soldiers the poor young fellows like sheep being led to the slaughter when vassilissa met a detachment on the street going to war in full military array she always had to turn away they were going to meet death but they shouted and sang at the top of their lungs and how lustily they sang as if they were out for a holiday what forced them they should have refused we won t go to our death we won t kill other men then there would be no war vassilissa was able to read and write well she had learned from her father a compositor she read tolstoy and liked his work in the shop she was the only one for peace she would have been discharged but all hands were needed the manager looked askance at her but did not let her go soon vassilissa was known throughout the district she is against the war a follower of tolstoy the women stopped speaking to her she doesn t want to have anything to do with her country she doesn t love russia she is lost reports of her reached the local organizer a bolshevik he became acquainted with vassilissa and talked with her soon his opinion was formed a girl of character knows what she s about the party could use her she was drawn into the organization but vassilissa did not become a bolshevik immediately she quarreled with the members of the party asked them questions and went away furious after long deliberation she came back of her own accord saying i want to work with you during the revolution she helped in the work of organization and became a member of the workers council she liked the bolsheviki and admired lenin because he opposed the war so uncompromisingly in her debates with the mensheviki and the social revolutionists she spoke skilfully heatedly tempestuously never at a loss for words the other women working women were timid but vassilissa always spoke up without hesitation whenever it was necessary and what she said always was clear and to the point she won the respect of her comrades under kerensky she was a candidate for the municipal duma the girls in the knitting shop were proud of her now her every word was law vassilissa knew how to manage women speaking amicably upbraiding them as the case required she knew everyone s troubles for she had been in the factory herself since her girlhood and she defended their interests her comrades sometimes rebuked her can t you forget your women we have no time for them now there are more important things vassilissa flared up gave the comrades a good berating and quarreled with the district secretary but she did not withdraw her demands why are women s affairs less important this idea is a habit with all of you that s why women are backward but you can t have a revolution without the women woman is everything man does what she thinks and suggests to him if you win over the women half your work is done vassilissa was very belligerent in she knew what she wanted and she did not compromise the others relaxed a bit in the last few years lagged behind and stayed at home but vassilissa carried on always fighting always organizing something always insisting on a definite point she was tireless where did she get her energy she was delicate with not a drop of blood in her face only eyes sympathetic eyes intelligent and observant vassilissa received a letter the long and hungrily expected letter from her man her comrade her lover they had been separated for months there was nothing they could do about it first the civil war and now the economic front the party was mobilizing all its members the revolution was no game it demanded sacrifices from everybody so vassilissa too brought her sacrifice to the revolution nearly always she had to live without her lover far away from him they were torn apart at opposite ends of russia her friends said you re better off this way he ll love you longer because he won t get tired of you perhaps they were right but life was sad without him true vassilissa had little free time from early morning until late at night she was overwhelmed with work for the party and for the soviet one crowding out the other important urgent fascinating work but when she came to her little room her heart was convulsed with longing for her lover she felt an icy draught she would sit down to drink tea and to think it seemed as if no one needed her as if she had no comrades although she had worked with them all day as if she had no goal for which she was striving what was the use of it all who wanted it mankind men couldn t appreciate it today again they had spoiled something called one another names made complaints everyone was working for himself alone they refused to understand that they must live for society they could not understand even vassilissa had been insulted rudely abused reproached for her worker s payok ration card the devil take it she didn t need it her comrades had persuaded her now her strength was leaving her she felt dizzy there she sat leaning on the table and drank her tea nibbled rock candy and brooded over all the affronts of the day now she could see nothing good or splendid in the revolution only failure vexation and struggle if only her lover had been there then she could have talked and unburdened her heart he would have caressed her tenderly why so dejected vasya a tomboy like you afraid of no one challenging everybody overlooking nothing and now look at her there she sits with ruffled feathers like a puffed up sparrow under the gable he would pick her up he was strong would carry her about the room like a child and sing a lullaby they would laugh her heart ached with joy oh how vassilissa adored her lover her man and comrade a handsome fellow tender and loving so tender thinking of him vassilissa felt even more wretched her attic was so desolate so lonely she sighed clearing away the tea things she scolded herself what in the world do you want do you expect only joy from life you love your work you have the esteem of your comrades and then you have your lover isn t that more than enough vassilissa dementyevna the revolution is no holiday everyone must sacrifice everything for the commonweal everything for the triumph of the revolution thus vassilissa in the winter but now it was spring the sun shone so gayly the sparrows chattered under the gables early in the morning vassilissa watched them smiling as she remembered her lover calling her a puffed up sparrow spring sounded a call to life it was more and more difficult to work vassilissa was anemic and her lungs were affected vassilissa had organized a community house a task she had taken over of her own accord and which was entirely independent of her general party and soviet work this community house was dearest of all to her she had long had the idea of organizing a model house where the communist spirit should prevail not an ordinary community house where everyone would live for himself where no one cared for his neighbor where squabbling bickering and dissatisfaction were the rule where no one was willing to work for the common good where everyone was constantly making demands no vassilissa had planned something quite different patiently almost secretly she had got the house ready how many difficulties she had had the house had been taken away from her twice it had involved her in innumerable disputes but finally she had succeeded had organized it a community kitchen a laundry a nursery a dining room vassilissa s pride with curtains at the windows and geranium plants and a library furnished like a club room at the beginning everything went well the women who lived in the house covered vassilissa with their moist kisses there s our little darling our guardian angel you ve made everything so easy for us it s too wonderful but then the trouble began the house rules were broken it was impossible to teach the women cleanliness they fought over the pots and pans in the kitchen they let the washtubs overflow almost flooding the house and every mistake every quarrel every disturbance brought complaints against vassilissa as if she were the landlady as if she had been at fault punishments became necessary the tenants grew angry felt offended some of them moved away matters went on in this fashion growing worse and worse constant quarrels and differences there were a couple of real trouble makers the fedosseyevs nothing could please them always nagging and nagging though they didn t know themselves what they wanted never satisfied and they stirred up the others chiefly because they had been the first to move into the house and felt as if it belonged to them but what did they want what didn t they like vassilissa couldn t understand and they embittered her life caused trouble every day vassilissa was weary vexed to tears she saw the failure of her plan then a new order everything must be paid for with cash on delivery water and electricity taxes must be paid assessments must be covered vassilissa was beset on all sides there was no use the new exchange rate nothing could be done without money vassilissa worked like a slave it might have been better to drop the whole business but she was not that sort once she put her hand to anything she saw it through she went to moscow visiting various bureaus day after day she approached the highest authorities her reports and accounts were received very favorably finally she won her community house they even assisted her with an allowance for repairs but in the future she would nevertheless have to make the house self supporting vassilissa returned delighted the fedosseyevs however were sulky they were cross with her as if she had harmed them by winning her fight for the community house now new worries began the rumor spread that vassilissa did not keep her house accounts straight that she made a little profit on the side it was hard then without her lover she needed a close comrade she wrote to him called him but important affairs prevented his coming he had a new position of great responsibility he had to systematize and reorganize the affairs of the firm in which he had formerly been a clerk he had been complaining all winter it was a difficult task it was impossible for him to get away everything rested on his shoulders so vassilissa remained alone in all her difficulties drained to the dregs the cup of man s unfairness and who was unfair her own people her comrades the workers this hurt more than anything else if it had only been the burshui when the fedosseyevs were to be put out the two of them begged vassilissa to forgive them assured her that they had always esteemed her but she could not enjoy her victory she was tired worn out too exhausted to be glad she fell ill then she returned to her work but in her soul something had died she no longer loved the community house it was as if her child had been violated like an incident of her childhood her brother kolyka showed her a piece of candy but when she reached out for it he laughed spitefully saying now i ll make it disgusting for you and he spat on it why don t you eat your candy vassilissa it s good but vassilissa turned away in tears you dirty thing you bully you good for nothing why did you spoil my candy this was how she felt about the community house now she was sick of it true the management was still in her hands but her heart wasn t in it if only she could get away her relations with the tenants had been spoiled were they not against her didn t they side with the fedosseyevs and why why on the whole she lost her interest in people before vassilissa had been much more warm hearted she had thought of everyone pitied everyone worried about everyone now she wanted only one thing leave me alone don t touch me i m tired chapter ii spring was peeping through the window of vassilissa s attic high up under the roof the warm sun peeped in and the spring sky with its fleecy clouds white delicate melting away next door was the roof of what had been a gentleman s house and now was used as the mothers home behind it lay a garden the buds were beginning to swell spring beloved spring was late but it had come at last today there was spring in vassilissa s heart also it had almost frozen in the winter always lonely always alone constant worries struggles irritations but today was a holiday a real holiday there was a letter from her lover from her dearest volodya and what a letter it was a long time since she had got a letter like that don t torture me vasya my patience is at an end how often you ve promised to come to me for a visit but you always disappoint me you hurt me you tireless tomboy of mine have you been fighting with everybody again there were rumors about you even among the comrades here they say you even got into the papers but since you came out on top in this business come to your beloved volodya now he can hardly wait for you you ll see we ll live like fine people i have a horse and a cow of my own and an automobile always at my disposal i have servants so that you will have no work to do in the house but can take a good rest spring is at its height here the apple trees are in full bloom vasya darling tomboy we ve never spent a spring together but our life must always be like the spring anyway i need you very much just now i m having trouble with the party committee here they have it in for me they can t forget that i was once an anarchist it started on account of savelyev as i wrote you you ll have to straighten out this business i m sick of all these meddlers they don t let you breathe it s hard for them to find anything against me i m doing my duty well but all the same i need you very much now i kiss your brown eyes yours forever volodya vassilissa sat beside the window watching the white clouds in the sky and thinking her eyes were smiling a good letter volodya loved her very much and how she loved him she laid the letter on her knees and stroked it as if it were volodya s head she didn t see the blue sky the roof the clouds she saw only her handsome volodya with his mischievously twinkling eyes vassilissa loved him loved him so that it hurt how had she ever lived through the entire winter without him she hadn t seen him for seven months and it seemed to her that she had little thought of him little longing for him she had no time to think of her man or to yearn for him how much trouble and worry she had had during the winter the child of her heart the community house was safe but she had had to quarrel with stupid uncomprehending uncultured people and she had hidden her love and longing for volodya in the innermost corner of her heart her love for him dwelt in her heart unchangeable thinking of him vassilissa felt that he was there in her heart a sweet burden she actually felt the weight of her love probably because she always had to be worrying about him if only nothing happened to him he did not maintain discipline the comrades were right vassilissa knew it they accused him of being an anarchist he didn t like to follow instructions preferred to do things in his own way but he made up for this with his work this was why they lived separately so that they wouldn t disturb each other for she too was in her work with all her heart and soul but when volodya was around she would be drawn to him and her work would suffer first our work and then our love don t you think so vasya said vladimir and vasya agreed their ideas were the same and it was so wonderful that they were not merely man and wife but comrades as well now again he summoned her to help him like a comrade to overcome his difficulties what sort of difficulties vassilissa read the letter again a mist seemed to form before her eyes if it was on account of savelyev it would be a nasty affair this savelyev was a speculator he was crooked why did volodya have anything to do with him a manager such as volodya was now had to be as blameless as a saint had to avoid all rogues volodya however was a trusting soul he felt sorry for savelyev stood up for him still no one should feel sorry for such men who were stealing the property of the people let them suffer the penalty for their misdeeds but volodya was kind hearted and the others could not understand him they would have other explanations for this friendship volodya had many enemies for he was hot headed unable to control his tongue if only matters wouldn t develop as they had three years ago if only no action were brought against him it was easy to lose one s reputation a charge could be trumped up against anyone vassilissa s experience had taught her that hadn t people been stirred up against her all winter long now it was volodya s turn she would have to go to him and help him she had to stand by him so that his comrades there would be ashamed of themselves what was there to think about she would get ready and go but the house she didn t care there was nothing to salvage now everything was going to ruin anyhow even though vassilissa had won the fight the fedosseyevs were the actual victors it was impossible to save anything vassilissa sighed going to the window she looked down into the court as if she were bidding the house farewell she stood there for a long time gravely sadly suddenly it struck her soon i ll see volodya again her cheeks flushed her heart beat with joy my beloved my dearest i m coming coming to you my volodya vassilissa was sitting in the coach sleeping it was her second day of travel another twenty four hours lay ahead of her this trip was different from her others she was provided with every comfort like a burshuika vladimir had sent her the money for the trip everything had to be paid for nowadays and had asked that she go in the sleeping car besides he had sent her a piece of cloth for a suit a manager s lady had to be well dressed vassilissa had to laugh when a comrade came from vladimir ivanovitch the director and brought her the money and the cloth he praised the quality like a true salesman vasya laughed and teased the comrade but he seemed offended he had not been joking the material really was excellent vasya said nothing more these new comrades the economists were beyond her comprehension for a long time vasya turned the cloth over and over she was not used to thinking of clothes but if volodya wanted it so that his wife would not be too conspicuous all right she would have a fashionable suit made such as everyone was wearing she went to a friend the seamstress grusha and told her the story make it nice and stylish grusha like the clothes others wear grusha pulled out some fashion magazines that a comrade had brought her from moscow the previous fall she had sewed according to it all winter to the satisfaction of all that s fine grusha you select something i don t understand such things if it s neat and not torn i m satisfied i know nothing about the styles moistening her finger tips grusha spent some time in turning over the leaves of the much used magazine at last she found her choice there this ll be good for you you are thin you need something to make you seem fuller this is just the thing for you a little fullness in the sides and pleats in front then you won t look so flat i ll fix it so that your man will like you then that s settled they agreed on a price and kissed vassilissa went away happy it was a good thing there were dress makers in the world she would never have been able to make a dress by herself volodya however was a connoisseur of women s clothes of course for in america he had been employed in a fashionable women s wear shop and now his knowledge was useful to him the red merchants must know something of women s clothes they were a form of merchandise vassilissa was sitting at the window of her sleeping compartment she was alone her neighbor a nep girl very loud dressed in silks heavily perfumed her ears weighed down with rings had gone into the next compartment where she was laughing loudly with her cavaliers she had given vassilissa the cold shoulder curling her lips contemptuously beg pardon dear but you re sitting on my shawl you ll crease it or won t you go out into the corridor dear while i get undressed for the night as if she the perfumed nep girl owned the compartment and had let vassilissa in only out of the kindness of her heart vassilissa didn t like the nep girl s calling her dear but she didn t want to start a quarrel let her go to the devil night was falling bluish gray shadows covered the young fields over the distant purplish black strip of woods the sun hung like a red ball of fire the rooks had risen from the fields and were circling in the air the wires were rising and falling between the telegraph poles with the twilight an unaccountable anxiety and longing crept into vassilissa s heart not sadness but longing she had prepared for the journey settled her affairs and suddenly everybody had been sorry to see her leave perhaps she would never return the fedosseyev woman had come to her had embraced her had wept and begged her pardon it had been painful in her inmost heart vassilissa was not angry with fedosseyeva but she had no respect for her as she was unable to respect others of her kind vassilissa s comrades had accompanied her to the station the children of the community house had brought paper flowers they had made themselves and vassilissa realized that she had not given her strength and energy in vain the seed was sown something would grow when the train began to roll out the tears rose to her eyes they were waving their caps suddenly she loved them all so much it was hard to leave them but hardly had the city dropped behind her hardly had the wooded strips and suburban settlements begun to approach her and then hasten away as if they were running a race than vassilissa forgot her community house the joys and sorrows of the winter swifter than the train her thoughts rushed far ahead to him for whom she longed why was vassilissa so melancholy now whence the longing that had crept into her heart it was as if a cold vise were gripping her heart what was she longing for perhaps it was because with the community house a piece of her life had dropped into the past never to return had disappeared like those narrow fields that shone like amber in the spring sun she began to cry softly imperceptibly she wiped away her tears and felt relieved as if the cold little lump of yearning that had tortured her heart had dissipated together with the tears on the skirt of her new dress the lights were turned on in the car the shades pulled down it suddenly became cozy and her loneliness disappeared vassilissa s heart not her mind knew very clearly two more nights and then she would see volodya would see him embrace him she felt his burning lips and strong arms heard his voice a sweet languor throbbed through her body her eyes were laughing if it hadn t been for the nep girl who was fussing before the mirror vassilissa would have sung with joy loudly as the birds sing of spring the nep girl was gone the door banged stupid woman closing her eyes vassilissa thought of vladimir her lover dreaming she read page after page of the story of their love they had been in love for five years she could hardly believe it five years she felt as if they had met only yesterday she settled down more comfortably in the corner of her compartment her feet drawn up her eyes closed the gentle rocking of the car relaxed her entire body her thoughts however hurried on and on the voice of memory what was it like their first meeting it was at an assembly shortly before the october days a time of restlessness they were only a handful of bolsheviki but how they worked the mensheviki were in power and the noisy social revolutionaries the bolsheviki were attacked from all sides people almost used physical violence against them the german spies the traitors yet the group increased from day to day they did not know themselves exactly what was to be but they knew one thing there must be peace come what may and the patriots the traitors must be thrown out of the soviets this was certain and they fought obstinately ardently uncompromisingly full of faith an unspoken resolve shone in the eyes of all we will die but never compromise no one thought of himself did anyone consider the individual then remembering this time vassilissa saw not herself but only the group the social revolutionary and menshevik papers had printed some items about her pure fiction lies slander but let them revile her it couldn t be otherwise anyway people didn t read everything in the papers they simply believed that justice was on the side of the party of the bolsheviki have you no pity for your mother you re disgracing the entire family getting mixed up with the bolsheviki you re selling your country to the enemy wept the old woman unwilling to listen to such reprimands at home vassilissa went to live with another girl she could not sympathize with her mother s tears strangers seemed closer to her only one goal stood clearly before her the victory of bolshevism she seemed to be urged on by some force it was impossible to stop though this force might hurl her into an abyss she would go on nonetheless would struggle she would fight the controversy became more acute the air more sultry a storm was inevitable there was news from petrograd the resolutions of the congress trotzky s speeches the proclamations of the petrograd soviets then they met the assembly was crowded the hall was packed people were standing on the window sills sitting on the floor in the aisles there was hardly room to breathe what sort of meeting was it vassilissa had forgotten for the first time a bolshevik was elected chairman and the committee too consisted of bolsheviki and left wing social revolutionaries among them was an anarchist an independent known in the city as the american vladimir it was the first time she saw him but she had heard much of him some were delighted with him and said he s a real man he knows how to make people listen to him others found fault with him a braggart but he had the union bakers and the commercial clerks behind him he had to be reckoned with the bolsheviki were glad when he scored against the mensheviki and were angry when he said something against them what in the world did he want the party secretary couldn t endure him he s crazy we re better off without such friends but stephen alexeyevitch the most esteemed bolshevik of the city laughed into his gray beard as he said wait a bit be patient he will yet become a splendid bolshevik he s anxious to fight just wait until he s lost his american spleen so vassilissa had heard of him but she paid no attention to him so many people would pop up without anyone s knowing the least thing about them it didn t pay to bother with them she came late to the meeting all out of breath she had been speaking at the brick yard there were meetings everywhere it had to be so in those days she was an orator then people liked to listen to her her speaking won general commendation because she was a woman a working girl vassilissa spoke objectively was neither wasteful nor sparing with her words she had mastered this manner of speaking terse but lucid she could hardly meet all the demands made on her when she came to the meeting she went directly to the platform it had been announced that she would speak comrade yurotchkin he was dead now killed at the front pulled her sleeve we ve won the bolsheviki won out in the election of the chairman two left wing social revolutionaries and the american besides he s almost a bolshevik now he s going to speak in a minute vassilissa glanced at the american and something about him surprised her so that is how an anarchist looks she would have thought him a gentleman he wore a stiff collar and a tie and his hair was parted a handsome fellow long eye lashes his turn was just coming he stepped forward cleared his throat and held his hand before his mouth like a gentleman she thought and could not help laughing his voice was pleasant engaging he spoke for a long time frequently making his audience laugh vasya laughed too he was a smart fellow after all the anarchist vasya applauded when he returned to the speakers table he accidentally bumped against vasya when he turned to apologize vasya blushed and embarrassed at blushing she colored even more it was annoying but the anarchist didn t notice it he sat down leaned back carelessly in his chair and smoked a cigarette the chairman turned to him pointed to the cigarette we re not accustomed to smoking here shrugging his shoulders vladimir continued to smoke i want to smoke and i will your rules don t apply to me he took a few more whiffs and seeing that the chairman was busy with something else threw the cigarette away vasya had forgotten nothing of all this later she had teased vladimir about it but at that time he had not yet noticed her he became aware of her only when she began to speak she spoke very well that evening and though he was behind her she felt the american s eyes on her she deliberately lauded the bolsheviki as opposed to the mensheviki the social revolutionaries and the anarchists although she didn t even know then what the anarchists were she wanted to strike the american he acted too much like a gentleman vasya remembered how her hair came undone as she spoke at that time she had beautiful long hair which she braided and wound about her head she was speaking with all her heart passionately and the pins fell out of her hair it was unpleasant her hair was in her way she tossed it back she didn t know that her hair had cast a spell over vladimir i didn t see you while you were speaking but when your hair fell over your shoulders i saw clearly that you were no orator but vasya my tomboy a woman and such a funny one she was embarrassed but held her ground she waved her arms and abused the anarchists then her hair came undone curly little snakes were coiled on her back like threads of gold then vasyuk i realized that i would have to know you vladimir told her that later after they had fallen in love but she didn t know it at the meeting after her speech was finished she began to braid her hair yurotchkin picked up the hair pins for her thank you comrade it was very embarrassing everyone was staring at her she was afraid to look at the american he had surely noticed and had his own opinion of her something or other annoyed her she was angry at the american but why did she bother about him the meeting was over everybody was going away the american stood before her may i introduce myself he told her his name and explained who he was he pressed her hand praised her speech and again vasya flushed they began to talk to argue she was for the bolsheviki he in favor of the anarchists going with the crowd they reached the street it was a rainy and windy night a cab belonging to the party was waiting the american suggested that he take vasya home she agreed and they climbed into the cab it was dark in there and the cab was narrow they sat close together the horse shied and splashed in the mud puddles with its hoofs vassilissa and vladimir stopped disputing sat there quiet and silent both grave and yet happy they talked about trifles about the rain about the meeting that would take place the next day in the soap works about the assembly at party headquarters but their hearts were full of gladness they were at vasya s house and bid each other good night both were sorry that they had to part so soon but neither said so are you sure your feet didn t get wet vladimir asked anxiously my feet vasya was amazed but happy about something for the first time in her life someone had thought of her had been concerned about her and vasya laughed her regular white teeth shining vladimir would have liked to take her into his arms then to kiss those moist white regular teeth the door opened the watchman let vasya into the house good bye until tomorrow at headquarters don t forget the meeting opens at two sharp we do things in the american way vladimir raised his soft hat and took his leave with a profound bow vasya turned in the doorway as if she were expecting something more the door banged vasya was alone in the dark little court and suddenly the happy mood was gone her heart was uneasy sick with longing something grieved her something hurt her she seemed so small to herself so useless chapter iii vasya was sitting in the car her head pillowed on her woolen shawl she was not sleeping but she saw the past as in a dream as in a moving picture reel after reel scene after scene joy and misery all her life with vladimir with volodya beautiful memories and as she remembered them even her sorrows seemed pleasant she settled down more comfortably the car rocked soothingly luxuriously in her mind s eye vassilissa saw the meeting of the union a noisy shouting restless assembly the bakers were an obstreperous stiff necked unruly crowd vladimir was in the chair he alone knew how to manage them it was difficult but finally he succeeded the veins of his forehead were swollen with the effort but he had carried his point he hadn t noticed vasya s coming she sat modestly beside the wall and watched it was resolved to present the government with a vote of lack of confidence and to put the union in the hands of the workers an administrative committee of their own was elected immediately shareholders members of the municipal duma and burshui were struck off the list and their contributions cancelled thenceforth the union would no longer be a municipal affair but would belong only to the bakers and the employees of the union but the mensheviki were not to be caught napping they sent their confidential agents to notify the proper parties the assembly was beginning to disperse only the administrative committee was remaining for a meeting when suddenly to everybody s consternation there appeared in the doorway the menshevik commissar the highest authority in the city a follower of kerensky behind him the leaders of the mensheviki and the social revolutionaries when vladimir saw them his eyes twinkled craftily comrades the meeting is adjourned only the administrative committee of the revolutionary bakers union will remain for a session tomorrow there will be a general meeting to discuss current affairs now everybody go home vladimir s voice resounded calm and resolute the audience rose noisily stop comrades stop came the irate voice of the commissar i beg you not to adjourn the meeting the commissar is too late the meeting has already been adjourned but if you wish to acquaint yourself with our resolutions you are welcome to them here they are we had intended to send a delegation to you but now you have come in person so much the better this is as it should be in times of revolution it s high time for the people to learn that it is not the duty of the organizations to run to the government officials with their reports but that the officials must come to the workers organizations for their news vladimir stood there unmoved gathered up his papers and in his eyes under the long lashes the little devils were laughing and dancing he s right he s right cried the crowd many laughed the commissar attempted to protest he went up to vladimir became excited and shouted vladimir remained entirely calm only his eyes laughed his voice was loud and clear his answer to the commissar was audible throughout the hall the public laughed and applauded they were delighted to hear vladimir invite the commissar to a supper where the passage of the union from the burshuis to the bakers would be celebrated a smart fellow this american he has a tongue in his head the commissar had to leave without accomplishing his purpose he threatened to use force just you try it cried vladimir his eyes flashing and the entire hall repeated just you try it try it the atmosphere became threatening the commissar and his mensheviki beat a hasty retreat through a side door but the tumult in the hall continued the administrative session was postponed for the evening people had to eat first they were exhausted for the meeting had been going on since morning vasya went toward the door with the crowd suddenly vladimir stood before her calm his eyes laughing how different he seemed from the others in his neat blue suit but now she no longer saw him as a gentleman today she had felt he belongs to us after all how did he differ from a bolshevik and he was brave afraid of nothing he would face bullets if necessary in spite of his stiff collar suddenly there rose in vasya not merely the thought but the desire to lay her hand trustingly into vladimir s strong hand she would like to go through life with him side by side happily and confidently but what was she to a man like vladimir comparing herself to him vasya sighed he was handsome had seen much had been in america and she not much to look at ignorant and she had never been outside her province how could he pay any attention to her he hadn t noticed her today either however vasya had hardly formulated these thoughts when she heard vladimir s voice beside her delighted to see you comrade vassilissa didn t we put that commissar s nose out of joint though he won t try these tricks again he ll never come back here you can bank on that besides we tell him of our resolutions merely as a matter of form vladimir was excited enthusiastic vasya caught his spirit they began to talk both laughed and were happy if his comrades hadn t come for vladimir they would have stayed much longer in the ante room talking of the commissar and the resolutions well i must go now i can t stay any longer comrade vassilissa vasya heard regret in his voice her heart beat joyfully she raised her tenderly observant eyes to his vasya s soul was mirrored in her eyes vladimir looked into them silently as though he were lost in them why don t you come comrade vladimir don t keep the people waiting we re up to our ears in work i m coming hastily he pressed her hand and left vasya wandered through the city not knowing where she was going seeing neither streets nor people only vladimir this was something new for her a clear frosty winter s night stars countless stars twinkling in the sky the freshly fallen snow still white and spotless it covered the streets had settled down on the roofs and barns had bespangled the trees with its loose flakes vassilissa and vladimir were coming from a meeting the october days had come and gone now the power was in the hands of the soviets the mensheviki and the right wing social revolutionaries had been dislodged only the internationalists remained the power of the bolsheviki was growing the party ruled over all all the workers were for the bolsheviki only the burshuis the popes and the army officers opposed them the soviet was waging a campaign against them life had not yet taken its proper course the waves of the revolution had not yet calmed down the streets were patrolled by red guards there were occasional clashes but the worst seemed over vassilissa and vladimir were talking of the days when they had seized the power vladimir s bakers had stood in the gap then fine resolute fellows vladimir was proud of them and they had put him in the soviet vladimir and vassilissa were walking side by side through the quiet streets the red guard patrols demanded the password vladimir too had a narrow red band on his sleeve he was wearing a fur cap he had enlisted in the workers guard and had been under fire a bullet had passed through one of his cuffs he showed it to vasya though they had seen each other a good deal during this time they had never had a chance to talk there was no time for that that day however they had gone out together without any previous arrangement they had so much to tell each other they felt as if they were old friends meeting again to talk things over yet suddenly both were silent they felt closer to each other they had gone past vasya s house without noticing it they had reached the end of the suburb where the truck gardens began where in the world had they landed stopping they laughed in amazement they looked up to the sky where the stars were twinkling and sparkling we had no clocks in our village so we had to tell time by the stars my father knew them particularly well he could always tell exactly what time it was vladimir spoke of his childhood they had been a large family in a poor peasant s household there was too little of everything volodya wanted to go to school but it was too far away so he made a bargain with the pope s daughter he watched her geese and she taught him to read vladimir recalled his village the fields and woods of his home he grew tender and melancholy so that is what he s like vassilissa was surprised and he became even dearer to her he told her about america how he had come there as a boy having resolved to make his own way in the world after spending two years on board a transport he had worked in the dockyards finally he was driven away forced to go to another state he was starving took any work he could get for a time he was a waiter in a great palatial hotel how many rich people he did see there and as for the women all dressed up in silks and laces and diamonds then he was a porter in a large fashionable store where he was well paid he wore a gallooned uniform and he was liked because of his good figure but he soon became sick of it all these wealthy customers got on his nerves he tried being a chauffeur traveled through america with a rich cotton dealer covered hundreds of miles in an elegant auto however this too became tiresome after all he was little better than a serf the merchant introduced him into the cotton business where he became a salesman and learned bookkeeping and then the revolution dropping everything he hurried back to russia he had belonged to the organization even in america he had been arrested once after a clash with the police but the cotton merchant had come to his aid for he liked him as a chauffeur and held him in esteem although he knew him to be an anarchist he always shook hands with him too america was different from russia vladimir loved america in his way on and on they went through the streets vasya listened vladimir s flow of words was inexhaustible he seemed to be confessing his entire life to her again they reached the door of vasya s house won t you invite me in for a glass of tea comrade vassilissa asked vladimir i m parched with thirst and i really don t want to sleep yet vasya was doubtful her friend surely was in bed by this time that doesn t make any difference we ll wake her up the three of us will have a real party and why shouldn t she ask the american to come in she didn t want him to go away for they had become friends they went in put up the samovar vladimir helping one must always help the ladies that s what we do in america they lingered over their tea joking teasing vasya s friend whom they had pulled out of bed because she blinked her eyes so sleepily and again vladimir talked about america about the beautiful silk stockinged ladies who came up in their autos to the great store before which he stood in his gallooned doorman s uniform with a feather in his three cornered hat one of them had slipped him a note fixing a rendezvous but he didn t go he didn t care for women they could only cause trouble another had given him a rose listening to vladimir s stories of the beautiful american women with their silk stockings vasya felt more and more insignificant and unattractive the joy in her heart died and the world seemed dark and i suppose you fell in love with these beauties vasya s voice sounded hollow she was chagrined at having let the question slip out vladimir looked at her attentively and tenderly he shook his head all my life vassilissa dementyevna i have guarded my heart and my love i am keeping them for a pure girl but these fine ladies they re much too fast all of them worse than prostitutes and again joy flooded her heart only to ebb again without filling it he was keeping his heart for a pure girl but vasya was no longer undefiled she had had an affair with petya razgulov of the machine department until he went to the front then there had been the party organizer she had said she was engaged to him he too had gone away had stopped writing and she forgot him but what to do now only a pure girl vasya was looking at vladimir was listening to his voice but she did not hear what he was saying her heart was aching so vladimir thought she was bored with his stories he stopped talking and rose hastily coldly he took his leave vasya struggled against her tears she wanted so to throw herself into his arms but he didn t need her he had seen so many beautiful women and he was keeping his heart for a pure girl vasya cried all night she determined to avoid this american what could she mean to him vasya had firmly made up her mind to keep out of the american s way but fate had decided to bring them even closer coming to a committee meeting one day vassilissa found a violent dispute in progress a new city commandant was to be appointed some proposed vladimir others refused to consider him the secretary of the partcom was especially antagonistic it was not to be thought of the entire city was up in arms against the american his papacha pushed to the back of his head he rode about the town in the union cab as though he were a governor he irritated the people he recognized no discipline fresh complaints had come in about him he didn t follow union regulations vasya defended vladimir it hurt her to hear him spoken of in that way to hear him called an anarchist stupid this suspicion didn t he do better work than the bolsheviki stepan alexeyevitch also was in favor of vladimir the vote was cast seven against vladimir six for him well there was nothing to be done after all vladimir was a bit to blame too he tried to show off too much but vladimir was angry why didn t they trust him wasn t he with the revolution with all his heart and soul when he learned of the committee s vote he became furious he deliberately began to insult the bolsheviki partisans of the state centralists they want to institute another police r gime he spoke of america mentioned his i w w wherever he could the committee grew excited and demanded that vladimir comply with the regulations the breach widened from day to day vasya worked hard in vladimir s defense disputed till she was hoarse the matter was brought before the soviet the union had again failed to follow orders vladimir however repeated over and over i don t recognize your police ordinances every institution is its own master discipline i don t give a damn for your discipline we didn t make the revolution shed blood drive out the burshuis to let ourselves be chained again why do we need commandants we can command ourselves wrangling shouting if you refuse to submit we will expel you from the soviet threatened the presiding officer just you try it yelled vladimir his eyes flaming i ll recall all my bakers boys from the militia who ll defend you then soon you ll be in the hands of the burshuis again and that s where your soviet s heading it s no soviet it s a police district vassilissa s heart missed a beat why had he said that now all of them would pounce upon him she was right the meeting stormed with indignation what he had called the soviets names vladimir stood there white faced defending himself but there was a tempest round about him people were pushing forward expel him arrest him throw him out the blackguard thanks stepan alexeyevitch he helped him he asked vladimir to go into the next room the soviet would discuss the incident in his absence vladimir went and vasya followed she felt mortified it had been so stupid of him and she was angry at the soviets too how could they condemn a man for his words they should judge by his deeds everybody knew that vladimir was on the side of the soviet if not for him the bolsheviki might not have come out ahead in the october revolution it was he who had disarmed the officers it was he who had forced the head of the city to flee who had led the most obstinate of his opponents out into the street there shovel the snow why was he to be expelled from the soviet because of a hasty word greatly perturbed vasya went into the back room vladimir was sitting at the table brooding leaning his head on his hand as he looked up at her she saw pain chagrin and distress in his eyes suddenly he seemed small and helpless as a child vassilissa s heart filled with compassion she would do anything to spare him suffering well are the partisans of the state alarmed vladimir asked pretentiously did i frighten them with my threats things have not yet reached such a pass he stopped short vasya looked at him affectionately there was reproach in her gaze you are in the wrong vladimir ivanovitch you re harming yourself why did you say that now it looks as though you were against the soviet and i will be against it if the soviet is to be another police department vladimir still was stubborn why do you say something you don t believe yourself vasya came very close to him looked at him like a mother gravely tenderly raising his eyes to hers vladimir was silent admit that you lost your temper vladimir bowed his head i couldn t keep it back i was furious and again he looked into vasya s eyes like a boy confessing a fault to his mother nothing to be done about it now it s all over he motioned her away but vasya came even closer to him her heart was full of sorrow and tenderness he had become so dear to her she laid her hand on his head stroked it don t vladimir ivanovitch why do you lose heart aren t you an anarchist that s not the way vladimir you must believe in yourself mustn t let others bother you vasya was bending over vladimir stroking his head as if he were a little boy and he leaned his head trustingly on her heart as though he sought support in her so big and yet as woebegone as a child i m having such a hard time i thought the revolution the comrades everything would change and it will but you must try doing things in a friendly brotherly way no good will won t help now i don t know how to deal with people you ll learn i m sure you will vasya raised vladimir s head and looked in his eyes his gaze however was anxious and troubled bending down vasya gently kissed his hair we ll have to straighten out this matter you ll have to apologize say that you were hasty that they misunderstood you all right vladimir agreed obediently seeking support in her eyes suddenly he threw his arms about her crushed her to his heart until it hurt and his burning lips clung to vasya s mouth vasya ran back to the platform to the executive committee directly to stepan alexeyevitch matters stood thus and thus vladimir ivanovitch had to be helped out of the mess the incident was closed but the hostile attitude against vladimir did not disappear the soviet was divided into two camps the happy days of peace were over vasya didn t want to remember more but her thoughts flew on there was no stopping them how had they come together it was soon after the episode in the soviet vladimir was escorting her home they always left together in those days they were seeking each other when they were alone their conversation was tenderly intimate vasya s friend was out and vladimir taking vasya into his arms kissed her ardently passionately she still remembered those kisses but she released herself stepped back and looked him straight in the eyes volodya you mustn t kiss me i won t stand for any deception amazed he failed to understand deception do you think i want to deceive you can t you see that i ve loved you ever since i ve known you that s not it that s not it volodya of course i believe you but you see i i no don t kiss me you re keeping your heart for a pure girl and i m not a virgin any more volodya i ve had lovers as she spoke she thought trembling now my happiness is shattered vladimir interrupted her what do i care for your lovers you belong to me no one can be purer than you vasya your soul is pure passionately he pressed her to him you love me vasya don t you don t you love me don t you belong to me to me and to no one else and look here don t you ever again mention your lovers don t tell me anything i don t want to know anything i don t want to you belong to me and that s the end of it this was the beginning of their union menage chapter iv the compartment was dark the nep girl had gone to bed after perfuming the entire car with eau de cologne vassilissa was lying quietly in her upper berth if only she could fall asleep but memories of the past insisted upon coming up as if she were settling her accounts but why settle them all her life was still before her love and happiness awaited her yet somewhere in an obscure corner of her heart vasya felt that things weren t as they used to be the happiness of four years ago was gone their love had changed and vassilissa too was different why whose fault was it her hands folded beneath her head vassilissa lay there thinking in all these years she had never had time to think she had lived and worked but now she had a feeling of having forgotten or neglected something why dissension within the party trouble in the institutions everything had been different then volodya too had been different true she had had her hands full with him he would fall out with the authorities but vasya always was able to reason with him he trusted her and always followed her advice the whites commenced their offensive the city was in danger vladimir decided to enlist for the front and vasya did not hold him back she only tried to persuade him to join the party before he left he resisted at first but finally gave in thus he became a bolshevik and went away they corresponded very little now and then he would come back for a day or two and then more weeks and months of separation as if it had to be so they didn t even miss each other very much there was no time for such things then vasya learned at a committee meeting that a charge was being pressed against vladimir what could that mean he was working for the artillery and they said he wasn t managing his affairs properly that he wasn t entirely straight and aboveboard vasya flared up that wasn t true she didn t believe it it was a conspiracy or slanderous gossip she rushed out to find out more it seemed a serious affair the case had not yet been brought into court but he had been removed from his post she begged stepan alexeyevitch to bring about her transfer to a transport train bearing gifts to the front and in three days she was on her way it was very hard to get through delays everywhere the trains missed one another there was something wrong with the papers the gift bearing car wasn t coupled on she was exhausted and worried the case might already have come to court only then did vasya realize how she loved vladimir how much he meant to her and she trusted him as much as it was possible to trust anyone the more others suspected him for they felt that an anarchist was capable of anything the more vigorously she defended him no one knew his heart as well as she vasya and his heart was tender as a woman s his harshness and obstinacy were only on the surface vasya knew that kindness and gentleness could always lead him on the right path but it was true that he had become embittered the life of the proletarians was hard finally vassilissa reached headquarters where after much difficulty she learned where vladimir lived she was forced to walk all the way across the town in a pouring rain it was a good thing that a comrade went with her she was tired shivering with the cold but she was glad for now she knew that the investigation was not yet over there was no evidence opinions varied within the army itself rumors and denunciations were current vasya was confused only by the disagreeable smile with which people looked at her by their air of hiding something when she openly called herself his wife she had to try to understand everything and then she would have to go to comrade toporkoff of the central administration he knew vladimir and his work this prosecution would have to stop why did they harass him others too had once been mensheviki or social revolutionaries but no one hounded them why was an anarchist worse than they they reached the little wooden house where vladimir lived the windows were lighted but the door was locked the comrade knocked no answer vasya s feet were soaked to the ankle her clothes were wet and she was cold she was thinking not of the joy of seeing vladimir again but only of getting into the warm room as soon as possible to change her dress and stockings she had been sitting in the heated baggage car for five days had had practically no sleep let s knock on the window suggested the comrade he broke off a birch rod tapped on the window with it someone pulled back the curtain and vasya saw volodya s head he seemed to be wearing only a shirt as he strained his eyes to see in the dark a woman s head bobbed up from behind his shoulder only to disappear again vasya felt her heart sinking a sharp sickening pain why don t you open the door comrade i ve brought you your wife the curtain was drawn hiding volodya and the woman vasya and her companion mounted the steps leading to the door they waited why did it take so long to vasya the time seemed endless at last the door opened vladimir took vasya in his arms pressing her to him and kissing her his face was radiant his eyes wet with tears you came you came to me my friend vasya my comrade take her things at least grumbled her escort what ll i do with them come right into the house we ll have some supper you must be soaked through and freezing they entered the house it was bright and clean a dining room with a bedroom behind it at the dining room table sat a nurse with a white kerchief about her neck and a red badge on her sleeve she was pretty vasya felt another stab at her heart volodya introduced the two this is sister barbara my wife vassilissa dementyevna they shook hands and looked at each other searchingly as if each wanted to sound the other what s the matter vasya take off your wraps aren t you the lady of this house see how well i live here better than in your little room let me have your coat how wet it is we must hang it up next to the stove the nurse had remained standing well vladimir ivanovitch we ll let our business discussions go until tomorrow i don t want to disturb your domestic bliss tonight she shook hands with vasya and vladimir and went out together with vasya s escort vladimir picked up vasya and carried her about the room he fondled her kissed her was beside himself with joy vasya s heart felt less heavy and she was ashamed of herself still she asked casually between kisses who was that nurse and she bent back her head the better to look into vladimir s eyes the nurse she came to see me about the provisioning of the hospital deliveries must be made more quickly there are delays along the line they can t get along without me though they made me stop my work as soon as something goes wrong they come to me he turned the conversation to the charges against him spoke of the thing that worried them both he set vasya down and they went into the bedroom once more vasya felt that stab the bed was untidily made as if someone had hurriedly thrown the covers over it she glanced at vladimir placing his hands on his back a gesture vasya knew and loved he paced up and down the room he told her of his case what had happened how it had begun listening vasya suffered for him she felt clearly that it was all envious gossip her volodya s hands were clean she was convinced of that it could not be otherwise she took a pair of stockings from her suit case but she had no other shoes what to do vladimir noticed it that s how you are you haven t even an extra pair of shoes of course i can get some leather and our cobbler will make a pair for you as a special favor but now let me take off your shoes how wet they are he drew off her shoes threw vasya s wet stockings on the floor took her cold feet into his warm hands what tiny feet you have like a doll oh vasyuk mine my darling bending down he kissed her feet what are you doing volodyka you silly boy she laughed her heart was joyful again they drank tea talked and held council vladimir told her everything how he had been rude at the wrong time how he had disregarded instructions and had done things his own way he couldn t stand orders he told her of the times when he had furthered the cause and of the undesirables he had employed but as for being light fingered vasya surely could not believe that of him vladimir stood before her choking with rage so you too could think that of me you vasya no no volodya i was only afraid that your accounts might be a bit muddled they re so strict nowadays you needn t worry about my accounts those who started this business will find their finish in it my accounts are clear as crystal the bookkeeping i learned in america has come in handy vassilissa felt a load off her heart all that was necessary now was to meet the comrades consult with them and explain the how when and where it was so clever of you to come here said vladimir i didn t dare expect you i know how hard you work and assumed you d be too busy for your husband for your volodyka why don t you know that i have no peace when you re not with me i m always worrying what s he doing how does he feel has anything happened to him you re my guardian angel vasya i know that he spoke very gravely and kissed vasya his eyes became sad and thoughtful i m not worthy of you vasya i love only you i love you above all things you believe me don t you i love you love you no one but you anything else is absurd here vasya didn t understand him his unusual vehemence his agitation puzzled her they went into the bedroom it was time to go to sleep intending to make the bed vasya threw back the covers what was that her temples pounded her knees trembled a woman s bandage a blood stain on the sheet volodya what s that her voice faltered she moaned vladimir rushed to the bed savagely threw the bandage to the floor that hussy that landlady of mine she lay down here again when i was out soiled the bed he threw the sheets on the floor vladimir wide eyed vasya stood before him her look said everything vladimir gazed at her and remained silent why that volodya why wringing his hands volodya threw himself on the bed it s all over it s all over but i swear to you vasya i love only you only you why did you do it why didn t you think of our love i m young vasya all alone for months and they re forever running after you these common hussies i hate them all all of them these filthy women he stretched out his arms toward her tears were rolling down his cheeks large burning tears you must understand vasya you must or i can t live you must pity me life is so hard vasya bent down and kissed his head as in the soviet long before and again she pitied him again she was filled with compassion for this big helpless childlike man who would understand him if not she even now everyone was ready to throw stones at him should she really drop him because he had hurt her had she not once been ready to bear the brunt of every blow destined for him a poor thing her love if she would leave him the first time he had made her suffer bending over vladimir vasya silently stroked his hair seeking a way out someone knocked at the door a harsh commanding knock what was that they exchanged a glance and both understood a hurried embrace a passionate kiss and they went into the hall they had guessed right the investigation had been closed and vladimir was arrested the ground seemed to be trembling beneath vasya s feet vladimir remained calm he collected his things told vasya where to find his papers whom to summon as witnesses who could give her information then they took him away that was years ago but vasya would never forget that night she had never lived through anything more dreadful than that night her heart was racked with twofold pain the century old insurmountable suffering of woman and the distress of the friend the comrade at the wrong done her beloved at the malevolence of men at the injustice of the world vasya walked about the bedroom as though she were mad she could not rest here before she came in this room on this bed vladimir had loved kissed embraced the other woman that pretty woman with the full lips and the voluptuous bosom might he not love her might he not have lied to vassilissa out of pity she wanted the truth the truth only why had they taken away vladimir just then if only he had been there she would have found out everything would have asked him if only he had been there she would have freed herself of her own agonizing thoughts would have been consumed with pity for him her woman s heart was aching and she grew furious at vladimir how had he dared do such a thing he would never have taken another woman if he had loved her and if he didn t love her he should have told her so frankly instead of torturing her with his lies vassilissa paced from one corner to the other she could not rest and suddenly a new thought pierced her heart suppose the charges against vladimir really were to be taken seriously suppose there really was a reason for his arrest suppose the undesirables the scoundrels had got him into trouble leaving the entire responsibility on his shoulders her heartache was forgotten forgotten the red lipped nurse now she was only trembling with an agonizing fear for vladimir racked and crushed by her suffering for him they had robbed him of his reputation had ruthlessly arrested him those were his comrades compared to that what was her feminine grief what had they done to her beloved vladimir his own comrades she felt hurt not at his having been with the woman but at the failure of even the revolution to bring an era of truth and justice vassilissa forgot her weariness as if her body had disappeared only her soul remained her heart torn by the sharp claws of her harrowing thoughts she waited for the morning and with the morning came the resolve to fight for vladimir they should not touch him she would liberate him from those envy filled schemers single handed she would convince everyone that he was stainless their slanders were false false their libelous attacks on his good name chapter v early that morning a red guard brought her a note from volodya vasya my wife my beloved comrade i don t care about the case against me now let them ruin me only one thought torments me maddens me that i might lose you i can t live without you vasya you must know that if you no longer love me make no efforts in my behalf let them shoot me yours only yours volodya and on the side diagonally i love only you whether you believe me or not and i will insist on it until i die another sentence in a corner i ve never reproached you with your past try to understand and forgive me now yours with all my heart and soul vasya read the note over and over and felt happier he was right he had never reproached her that she had not been a virgin after all men were like that what could he do when that hussy threw herself on his neck act like a monk she read the note again kissed it folded it carefully and put it in her pocket and now to get busy to get volodya out of trouble she wore herself out rushing from pillar to post growing excited running afoul of bureaucracy and the indifference of men giving up losing all hope then summoning all her strength she began to fight with renewed courage she would not permit the triumph of the wrong she would not let those scheming slanderers worst volodya she gained her most important point comrade toporkov took the matter in his own hands and after looking into it he made the following decision as the charges are groundless the case is to be dropped zviridov and malitchenko are to be arrested the next morning vasya could not leave her bed she had contracted typhus in the evening she recognized no one not even volodya when he returned in her memory vasya s illness seemed a dull dream it was night when she regained consciousness she looked about an unfamiliar room medicine bottles on the table a nurse with a white neckerchief sitting beside her bed wiry no longer young a severe expression on her face as vasya looked at her it bothered her to see a nurse sitting there the white kerchief irritated her why she hardly knew herself would you like a drink leaning forward the nurse held a glass to her lips vasya drank and lost consciousness again vaguely as in a dream she felt volodya bending over her and adjusting her pillow she became entirely unconscious she had a dream perhaps it was real there were two shadows in the room no not shadows women but not real women one white one gray turning twisting their arms entwining not a dance but a struggle and now vasya understood life and death had come to her were fighting for her which would win vasya was frightened so frightened that she wanted to scream but she could not utter a sound this frightened her even more her heart beat pounded as though it would burst any moment ping ping ping there was shooting on the street she opened her eyes in the feeble light of the night lamp she saw that she was alone it was night she listened a scratching mice as if they were rolling something under the floor ever nearer ever closer and now vasya was torn by a new fear she felt that the mice were trying to get on her bed on her and she would not be able to drive them away beginning to cry she called feebly volodya volodya volodya vasya darling my little sweetheart what s the matter volodya was bending over her anxiously peering into her eyes volodya are you alive really her strengthless hand felt about volodya s head i m alive we re both alive my dearest why are you crying what s the matter with my vasyuk were you dreaming are you delirious again tenderly he kissed her hands and stroked her damp short hair no no i wasn t dreaming the mice were scratching so she defended herself with a faint smile the mice volodya laughed my vasyuk has become so brave that it s afraid of mice i told the nurse that you shouldn t be left alone it s a good thing i came home just now vasya would have liked to ask him where he had been but she was so weak that she couldn t talk a delicious weakness however a sort of drowsiness and the nicest part of it all was his sitting beside her she held his hand in her feeble grasp would not let go her smiling lips whispered he s alive of course i m alive laughed vladimir gently he kissed her forehead vasya opened her eyes but what happened to my hair did they cut it off that s nothing don t worry about that now you re a real boy a real vasyuk vasya smiled she was happy volodya did not leave her as she dozed he sat on the chair beside her and watched over her sleep sleep vasya sleep you musn t look at me with your big eyes you ll have plenty of time to look at me when you re well again if you don t sleep now you ll be sick again and the doctor ll scold me he ll tell me i m a poor nurse you won t go away where would i go i sleep here every night on the floor beside you i m less worried when i m able to see you in the daytime i m working hard working in the commissariat yes indeed everything s all right again those rogues have been arrested but you re not to talk you impossible vasyuk sleep if you don t go to sleep i ll go away her helpless fingers tightened their hold on his hand but she closed her eyes quite submissively it was so wonderful so sweet to fall asleep with volodya sitting beside her looking at her so anxiously and tenderly my darling you must sleep you bad naughty boy i m asleep but i love you volodya bent over her and kissed her eyelids long very gently tenderly and vasya could have wept with joy she was willing to die right then and there no greater happiness could ever be hers the memory of what she had felt then made vasya start was such a thing impossible now had her heart been right when it told her that she could never know greater happiness and now that joy that happiness would be no more she was going to him to her beloved he had asked for her was waiting for her he had sent a comrade to tell her to hurry and he had sent her money for the trip and a dress so he must love her why then would she never be so happy again vasya wanted so much to believe in her happiness but doubt rankled in her breast she had no real faith in a brown study vasya again thought of the past they had parted quite suddenly that time the front was shifted when vladimir went away vasya still was so weak that she could hardly walk they parted on the best of terms the nurse was not mentioned again vasya had come to understand that the nurse had meant no more to him than a glass of whiskey you drink it and it s forgotten vasya had gone back home and immediately returned to her work at that time she believed that everything was as it had been that everything was all right again now vasya remembered that even then there had been a load on her heart something somewhere was raising its head was it bitterness because of the red lipped nurse or was it suspicion yet vasya loved volodya the fear they had shared and her illness had bound them even closer together they had loved each other before too but they had not felt so near to each other now after the distress they had gone through together their hearts were more united still vasya could no longer find the joy of a bright spring morning in her love it had become gloomier overcast with clouds yet it had grown deeper and stronger besides how could one have been in the mood for love and joy there were the fronts the partings the conspiracies the mobilization of the communists they were threatened from all sides were head over heels in work working in the housing bureau of the soviet vasya had to take care of the refugees it was there that she had developed her idea of organizing a community house to conform with her views stepan alexeyevitch had helped her with word and deed and vasya had plunged into her work she lived thus for months of course she thought of vladimir always had him in her heart but she did not have much time to yearn for him and he too had his work everything seemed to be running along smoothly he had stopped trying to show off so much and was at peace with the executive suddenly he surprised vasya in her attic quite unexpectedly he had been wounded in a skirmish during the retreat nothing dangerous but he needed a rest he was given leave and had come to board with his wife vasya was glad yet she could not help thinking why just now could it not have been two months before or a month later vasya was so worried just then and overwhelmed with work a congress was in session at the moment and the housing bureau was being reorganized she was fighting for her community house impossible to tell when the work would be finished she had almost had to tear herself in two and now volodya was there wounded in need of care how would she manage troubled she could not be really happy vladimir however was delighted as a child he had brought her a pair of shoes keeping the promise he had made on her first day in his house put them on vasya i want to see how your little doll s feet look in them vassilissa had no time there was a meeting of the housing bureau but she did not want to hurt vladimir she put them on and felt that she saw her feet for the first time they really looked like a doll s radiant with joy she looked at volodya she even forgot to thank him i want so much to pick you up vasyutka but i can t on account of my hand i love your little feet and your brown eyes vladimir was content excited and happy he talked and joked but vasya who should have been at the meeting long before listened only half heartedly she glanced at the alarm clock beside the little mirror on her dresser the minutes were slipping away they were waiting for her at the meeting they would be angry she was keeping everybody waiting and it wasn t proper for the chairman to be late vassilissa came back home late toward evening she was tired there had been unpleasant incidents she was worried climbing the stairs to her attic she thought it s nice after all to have volodya there i ll talk over my troubles with him but when she entered the room volodya wasn t there where might he be his cap was there his coat was hanging in its proper place he had probably gone out for a moment she cleaned up the room and put the teakettle on the petroleum burner but volodya had not come back where could he be she went out into the hall he was not in sight she waited grew worried again she went into the hall there was vladimir coming out of the fedosseyevs apartment they were laughing parting like the best of friends why had volodya gone to them he knew of their duplicity at last you ve come back vasya your cage depressed me so i was ready to hang myself all alone the livelong day i was glad to meet comrade fedosseyev he took me along with him don t have anything to do with them volodya you know they re always scheming you wouldn t ask me to die of boredom in your cage don t run away for the whole day then i won t go to the fedosseyevs but i have work to do i d be only too glad to come home to you earlier but i can t it s impossible of course you re busy but how did i manage to sit beside you at night when you had typhus and i used to get away in the daytime too to look after you i came to you on sick leave vasya i still have some fever vasya heard the reproach in his voice he was offended at her having been away all day but what could she do there was the reorganization of her department the coming congress i believe you re not overjoyed to have me here vladimir said i didn t think i d find you like this how can you say such a thing i m not glad i my dearest my beloved my sweetheart she threw herself into his arms they almost upset the petroleum burner there there and i was ready to think you had stopped loving me that you might have someone else you seemed so cold so indifferent even your eyes were strange not at all tender i m so tired volodya i ve no energy left you re my tireless little tomboy pressing vassilissa to him vladimir kissed her thus they lived together in their cage in the attic in the beginning they managed although vasya found it hard to devote herself to both her work and her man she was happy nonetheless there always was someone to talk to to advise her to sympathize with her when she was disappointed to help her plan for the future but the housekeeping was a nuisance vladimir had become accustomed to good food at the front but vasya s household she brought her dinner from the public kitchen she had no sugar with her tea but only rock candy for the first few days they lived on the groceries vladimir had brought i ve brought you some food flour sugar sausage for i know how you live like a sparrow under the gables without a bite to eat in the house when they had used up volodya s provisions however they were dependent on the public kitchen and volodya didn t like it he grumbled why are you forever feeding me millet and millet gruel i m no rooster there s nothing else to be had i have to live on my ration what are you talking about the fedosseyevs have no more than you but yesterday they served me a real dinner and a wonderful one at that fried potatoes and herring and onions fedosseyeva has the time for housekeeping but i don t you see that i m wearing myself out without attending to anything but my affairs you ve undertaken too much that s the trouble why do you bother about this community house the fedosseyevs were saying i know what the fedosseyevs are saying exploded vasya she was hurt at vladimir s associating with her enemies and you re not acting like a comrade when you listen to them and join them against me they quarreled both lost their tempers then both were ashamed of themselves and they made peace vasya however grew more worried over her inability to take better care of her man he had come to her wounded and she had offered him food from the public kitchen he had taken better care of her the other time and he had brought her a pair of shoes it grieved her to see volodya eating nothing he would swallow two or three spoonfuls of soup and would push away the plate i d rather go hungry than eat this dishwater make some tea and try to get some bread somehow or other i ll send you some flour later from the front so you ll be able to return it impossible to go on that way she had to find some way out vasya hurried to the meeting but her head was a jumble of resolutions and millet gruel what could she give volodya for dinner if only she had time she would find a way would think and prepare something she was delighted to meet her cousin on the way just at the right time the cousin had a daughter a lively capable girl just out of school now she was living with her parents had no definite occupation but was helping her mother with the housework her name was styosha there was no difficulty about the arrangements styosha would spend the day with them and keep house in exchange vasya would share her payok with her cousin a load off her mind vasya hurried on to her meeting tomorrow volodya would have decent meals styosha proved to be capable and she got along well with volodya they kept house together exchanged some of their supplies while volodya received a number of things from the union for old times sake vasya was content volodya no longer complained about the food but now he had another grievance against her you take care of everybody but i mean nothing to you again vasya was distressed thus was she torn back and forth between volodya and her work but why had he come at such a feverish time she tried to explain to vladimir but he was angry pretended not to understand you ve grown so cold vasya you ve even forgotten how to kiss i m so tired volodya all my energy s gone was her excuse but volodya was angry vasya herself realized that things couldn t go on that way here her lover had come to visit her after an endlessly long time and she was gone all day working returning only late at night dead tired scarcely able to tumble into bed how could she think of kissing there were painful incidents one evening volodya began to caress her but she fell asleep the moment her head touched the pillow the next morning vladimir teased her where was the fun in petting a lifeless body he was laughing but she saw that he was offended she too felt unhappy about it felt that she was to blame he could really believe that she no longer loved him but where was she to get the energy for everything one day vasya came home earlier than usual vladimir was preparing the dinner for himself what s the matter where is styosha your styosha is a little devil i threw her out if she dares to show her face here again i ll throw her down four flights of stairs why what happened what did she do take my word for it she s a devil i wouldn t have chased her away for nothing i don t have to tell you the whole story you ll only get excited she s a vulgar filthy creature i don t want to see any trace of her here vasya saw that he was furious at styosha and determined to ask no more questions she probably had stolen something she thought such things often happened and vladimir was very strict about his things though he was very liberal otherwise and always glad to share what he had with his comrades yet he had that possessive instinct let anyone dare take something of his without his permission he d never forgive him what ll become of our household let the house go to the devil i ll go to the hotel and i ve found some friends i won t starve styosha went to see vasya in the housing bureau demanded her payok what happened between you and vladimir ivanovitch styosha what did you do i didn t do a thing styosha s eyes flashed as she pushed her comb more firmly into her hair your vladimir ivanovitch always was fresh to me so i slapped his face good and hard for him he spit blood for quite a while and he won t try it again how silly you are styosha vladimir ivanovitch was only playing with you vasya was trying to remain calm but her head was swimming a nice sort of play that was why he had me down on the bed it s a good thing that i m strong no one can have me against my will vasya tried to convince styosha that it had all been meant playfully as a joke and that now vladimir ivanovitch was really cross with her but styosha looked more stubborn what was the difference what it was all about she would never cross that threshold again gloom enveloped vasya s heart she didn t blame volodya didn t even feel hurt it was her own fault after all why was she so cold she had offended volodya he might actually believe that she no longer loved him but this was nasty why had he touched the girl styosha was barely out of her childhood it was a good thing that she knew life what might not have happened otherwise the incident preyed on vasya s mind she was undecided as to whether she should tell vladimir that she knew everything or whether she should remain silent but vasya had no more opportunity of talking with vladimir a new order was inaugurated vladimir hunted up his old friends the employes of the union he disappeared for days at a time they never saw each other in the morning when vasya went to the housing bureau volodya was still sound asleep when she stopped in during the day he wasn t there when she came home at night the attic was still empty vasya would be nervous she didn t know whether she should go to bed or wait to have tea with him she heated her supper on the petroleum burner arranged her papers for the morning listened to the steps in the hall that wasn t vladimir she put out the fire for economy s sake and took up her papers again she looked over reports sorted petitions someone was hurrying up the stairs was it he no it wasn t vladimir vasya would go to bed alone would soon be sleeping the sleep of exhaustion but even in her sleep she would listen it was so cold and dreary without him sometimes he would be merry when he came home he would wake up vasya and make love to her he would be burning to tell her everything would have thousands of plans up his sleeve then vasya would feel so happy so content all her troubles would disappear sometimes however vladimir wasn t entirely sober when he came walking heavily he would look about him scowling with watery eyes he was full of self reproach on these occasions but he blamed vassilissa too what a life in a cage under the roof no pleasure no diversions a woman and yet not a woman and they had no child this particularly stabbed vasya although she had not wanted a child she would have liked to have one for his sake but it seemed impossible she never became pregnant other women wept and wailed because of their inability to avert the flood of children but it seemed that she vasya was to be denied the joys of motherhood anemia was the doctor s opinion in order to cheer up vasya vladimir decided to take her to the theatre he procured the tickets vasya came home at the appointed time vladimir was preening himself before the mirror he had put on fine clothes and looked like a gentleman again laughing vasya teased him she loved her handsome man and what ll you put on he looked at her anxiously haven t you a sunday dress vasya laughed again what in the world was a sunday dress he must have learned that in america where people dress up in a different outfit every day she would put on a clean blouse and the new shoes volodya had brought her that was all her finery vladimir looked cross he scowled at her so that she grew frightened do you think people will look only at your feet in the theatre and the rest of your clothes can be sackcloth i don t understand why you re angry volodya how can one help being angry at these organizers of ours they ve arranged our lives as if we were in prison here you ve no real amusement no real home no decent dress you have to live in a cage drink water eat garbage and wear coarse clothes why i was better off when i was out of work in the united states but you can t expect everything at once you know the collapse don t talk to me about the collapse what sort of organizers have we anyhow they ve torn down everything with their own hands but if anyone wants to do something constructive they shout do you want to become burshuis hands off no you don t know how to live that s why everything goes to pieces i m sure i didn t go through the revolution to lead such a life why the revolution wasn t for us for whom then for everybody the burshuis too don t be silly of course not for the burshuis for the workers the proletariat and what do you think we are not workers not proletariat they disputed and disputed almost coming late to the theatre through the streets they went through the slush of spring vladimir walking ahead silently with huge steps so that vasya barely could follow don t run so volodya i m all out of breath suddenly he stopped and waited after that he walked more slowly but still refused to say a word in the theatre vladimir met some friends with whom he spent the intermissions and vasya had to sit alone the theatre gave her no pleasure why had she wasted the evening now she would have to work twice as hard in the morning the congress opened shortly before vladimir s departure he attended it although he was not a delegate there was wrangling antagonistic groups were formed vladimir was on vasya s side leaving his friends he worked for her group wholeheartedly now vasya and vladimir became inseparable they went to and from the congress together discussed their stand at home the comrades of her group crowded vasya s room they drew up resolutions vladimir wrote on the typewriter they had procured everyone was working swiftly hurriedly they seemed welded together they would become agitated would quarrel then they would laugh again for no reason but their youth they liked the battle for its own sake it kept their minds off their troubles stepan alexeyevitch was there too sitting at the table and stroking his fine gray beard his genial animated eyes watched youth vassilissa was always whispering about something with him he spoke very highly of her said she was above the average but he seemed rather cool toward vladimir vasya was sorry to see it why this attitude vladimir too was distant in his manner your stepan alexeyevitch is too oily for me he smells of incense he s no communist fighter just a toady that s all vasya s faction was defeated but she had received more votes than she had expected that too was a victory as the congress was drawing to a close the time of vladimir s departure approached again vasya was torn in two she had to equip him for his trip and the congress was still going on but deep down in her heart vasya was glad once more she had felt that her man was not only her lover but her friend she was proud of him for he had been a great help to her group the comrades wouldn t let him go now good bye my vasyuk my little sparrow will stay all alone under its gable now it won t have anyone to tell its troubles to but to make up for that no one ll disturb you in your work did you ever bother me she embraced him fondled him didn t you say yourself that your man was taking up your time didn t you complain about the housekeeping oh don t talk of that it s much worse without you and she hid her head against his breast you re not only my sweetheart but my comrade too that s why i love you they parted tenderly on the best of terms after seeing off vladimir she hurried back to the congress thinking no matter how nice it is to be together you re better off alone the presence of your lover distracts your thoughts makes your work progress too slowly now she could again devote herself entirely to her work work and rest she had never had enough sleep when he was there did you see your husband off stepan alexeyevitch asked her at the congress yes vladimir has gone that s better for you he only got you into debt vasya was amazed how had stepan alexeyevitch known but she did not answer if she had admitted it her lover s prestige might have suffered chapter vi the train was to arrive in the morning and vassilissa was up with the first pale light of dawn she had to collect her things and dress to please her beloved volodya they had been hard those seven months of separation vassilissa was happy gay joyful she felt the spring in the air the nep girl was still in bed lying on her back and gazing at her reflection in a hand mirror but vasya had already washed herself carefully brushed her curls and put on the new dress grusha had made for her vassilissa looked into the mirror on the wall she saw only her eyes they sparkled so that her entire face looked beautiful everything seemed to be all right this time volodya wouldn t lecture her for running around in rags a station vassilissa looked out the window it was early in the morning the sun was shining in the north one could hardly see that it was spring but here everything was in bloom the trees too were full of flowers strange very odd trees leaves like those of the black alder but more delicate in color and the boughs covered with white blossoms resembling lilac blossoms but they were not lilacs their perfume sweet and very strong was pouring in through the window what sort of tree is that vasya asked the conductor we don t have them in our country white acacias white acacias they re pretty the conductor broke off a few branches and gave them to vasya how sweet their scent was and vasya was so happy that she was almost in tears everything about her was so beautiful so fascinating but the most important thing in another hour i ll see volodya will we be there soon again vasya turned to the conductor to her it seemed that the train wasn t moving at all it had stopped again at a siding at last it moved on now the city was in sight the cathedrals the barracks the suburbs the platform of the station but where was volodya where vasya looked out of the open window volodya however had come in through the other end of the car and took her into his arms there you are volodya how you frightened me they kissed quick let me have your things this is our secretary please take the things ivan ivanovitch we re going to the auto i have a couple of horses now vasya a cow and a car and i am intending to get some little pigs we have a lot of room it s a regular farm you ll see for yourself you ll live like the lady of the manor things are getting along well not long ago we opened a branch in moscow vladimir talked on and on he could not tell her quickly enough of the things he was busy with which filled his thoughts sitting in the auto vasya listened and although she was very much interested in what volodya had to say she would have liked to talk about her own affairs to find out how he had got along without her had he longed for her very much had he waited very anxiously for her they drew up before the house a one family house with a garden a half grown youth an errand boy in a gallooned cap was standing guard at the door he helped them out of the car now vasya we ll see how you like our house whether you ll find it better than your cage under the roof carpet on the stairs a mirror a reception hall vasya took off her hat dropped her coat they went into the living room sofas rugs a huge clock in the dining room some still lifes in gilded frames antlers on the wall well how do you like it vladimir was radiant with pride i like it vasya replied uncertainly looking about she didn t know herself whether she cared for it everything was so strange so unfamiliar and this is our bedroom vladimir opened the door wide there were two windows opening on the garden this pleased vasya at once trees she cried delighted white acacias she hurried to the window look around the room first you ll have plenty of time to run around the garden isn t it nice what i ve prepared for you i picked out and arranged everything myself i ve waited for you since the moment i moved in thanks darling vasya stretched to kiss volodya but he seemed not to see it took hold of her shoulders and turned her so that she faced the long mirror in the wardrobe see how convenient it is when you dress you can see yourself from top to toe in the mirror there are shelves inside for your underwear for your hats for all sorts of gewgaws why how many hats and gewgaws do you think i have you ve hit the nail on the head vasya laughed but volodya went on will you look at the bed a silk quilt i had a hard time finding it it belongs to me i didn t get it among my supplies and here s a pink lamp to light at night vladimir showed vasya around pointing out every trifle delighted as a child didn t i feather a cozy little nest for my little girl vasya listened smiling at his happiness but still not quite at ease she couldn t deny it the rooms were nice splendid rugs curtains mirrors but not familiar as if she had come into somebody else s house the things were not what vasya needed there were no tables where she could spread her books and papers only one thing really pleased her that she could see white acacias from the windows facing the garden get ready now and wash up then we ll have some breakfast said vladimir going over to the window to let down the shades what are you doing that for objected vasya it s so nice to look out into the garden but it won t do the shades have to be down by day or the upholstery will fade down sank the gray shades like heavy eyelids they hid the green of the garden shining in through the window and the room became gray monotonous even less familiar vasya washed her hands and combed her curls before the mirror what s that you have there did you have a dress made of the material i sent you why yes expecting a word of praise vasya looked up at volodya inquiringly let s have a good look at you he turned her about she could tell from his expression that he wasn t pleased where in the world did you get the idea of piling all that stuff on your hips you ve a narrow figure just the thing for the new fashions why did you get this monstrosity vasya was confused flushed to the roots of her hair she felt guilty why a monstrosity grusha says that s stylish now what does your grusha know about it she made a mess of the material you look like the wife of a pope you d do better to take off that dress and put on your every day skirt you d look more like yourself this way you re neither fish flesh nor fowl volodya did not see the disappointment in vasya s face he went out into the dining room to see about breakfast with a heavy heart vasya pulled off grusha s handiwork and hastened to put on her old skirt and the blouse with the leather belt she was not at all happy two little tears dropped on the old blouse they dried quickly and there was an unpleasant coldness in vasya s eyes the manager s housekeeper came to pay her respects during breakfast marya semyonovna a robust woman of middle age and respectable appearance vasya shook hands with her that wasn t necessary said vladimir after marya semyonovna had left the dining room if you don t act like the lady of the house you ll have them all on your neck vasya looked at him in amazement that s something i simply can t understand vladimir served vasya but she had no appetite felt ill at ease here look at the tablecloth morosov linen the napkins have the same design too but i didn t have them put out it costs too much to wash them where did you get all these things did you really buy everything vasya looked searchingly at vladimir such an idea why do you know what these furnishings would cost nowadays billions do you really think that my manager s salary enables me to buy such luxuries all these things were supplied to me i was lucky enough to come at the time when it was possible with the assistance of some friends to obtain such furnishings from the authorities now they ve put a stop to all this no one can have his house furnished like this today not unless he pays cash besides i bought several things on my own account during the winter the wardrobe with the mirror in the bedroom the silk quilt the drawing room lamp vladimir enumerated everything happily contentedly vasya s eyes grew colder and colder shone with wrath they no longer seemed brown but green like a cat s eyes and how much did all these splendid things cost you vasya s voice trembled vladimir did not notice but continued eating his chop and drinking his beer well if you calculated the total including what i ve taken on credit on the instalment plan it amounts to slowly so as to impress vasya vladimir mentioned a very considerable sum raising his laughing eyes to her face he seemed to say now do you see what a fine fellow i am why vasya what s the matter with you she had jumped to her feet was standing over him with angry green eyes where did you get the money tell me at once where what s the matter vasya calm yourself you surely don t believe that i got it dishonestly or don t you know anything about money values compare it with my salary and you ll see he told her the amount of his monthly drawing account and bonus that s your salary your monthly salary but how dare you a communist spend it for such trash for such nonsense poverty s increasing misery and famine are round about and the unemployed have you forgotten them was there nothing irregular about your becoming the manager the furious green eyes came closer to vladimir well sir manager will you be good enough to answer vladimir did not give up but wanted to bring vasya to reason to convince her good naturedly he laughed at her you live like a sparrow under the gables and have no idea of what money is worth others are earning even more and live quite differently they make a really elegant appearance but vasya was not the sort to be defeated with words she had made up her mind to demand an account why didn t he live as a communist why did he throw away his money on foolish trifles while poverty and famine held sway round about him vladimir realized that he couldn t get at her by this means he would have to try another way he would have to attempt a political explanation that it was all a part of the manager s task instructions from headquarters the main thing was to do all he could to make the undertaking flourish to increase the earnings of his company and this was his strongest point vasya must wait until she saw what he had accomplished in a year he had built up everything in a deserted place had increased the output so that now the entire trust was dependent on his supervision she would see for herself though he lived like a human being he was none the less concerned with every one of his employes with the most humble shipping clerk let her only get an insight into the matter then she would think differently but he had not expected that his friend vasya his wife his comrade would come there to join in the chorus of his enemies it was so hard to work that way he gave all his energy to the cause and these were his thanks even his wife was against him wanted to condemn him vladimir was offended and furious his eyes were those of an angry wolf they flashed fire at vasya as though to burn her because of her suspicion and condemnation vasya listened thoughtfully he might be right everything was different now the most important thing was that his accounts were straight and the work done the national wealth must be increased she was not disputing that because i get some things establish my own household am i to live in community houses forever and why are we worse than american laborers you should see how they live there they have their own piano their own ford their own motorcycle in the meantime the worthy marya semyonovna had looked into the dining room several times she wanted to serve the fritters and she saw that these two quarreled the moment they met that s how it had been with the real gentlefolk whom she had served before the revolution they or the communists they were all alike only it was too bad about the fritters they would spoil with the standing vladimir took vasya everywhere showed her the offices the warehouses and the homes he took her to the bookkeeping department too just take a look at our books you won t find such a system of accountancy anywhere else see how wonderfully i ve arranged things and then tell me that i m wasteful he asked the bookkeepers to explain to vasya the principle of their system which was simplified but accurate it had received special commendation from headquarters vasya listened carefully although she couldn t understand everything she saw that they were trying hard and loved their work volodya too was in it with all his heart and soul he took her to the homes of the employes purposely asked their wives whether they were satisfied he looked at vasya triumphantly everyone said the same thing were they satisfied nowadays it was impossible to be better off we owe our lives to your providence vladimir ivanovitch there and you say i m a spendthrift believe me i took care of our employes first i got as much as i could for them and only then did i think of myself you see how they live the workingmen are just as well off as the office force i made special efforts in their behalf really i did everything i possibly could very well you did all that but what about them what did they do for themselves what peculiar ideas you have vasya don t we have the same interests they and i before of course the manager stood on one side and the workers on the other but not now not here you ve become moss grown in your little bog he was joking yet vasya felt that vladimir wasn t pleased that she had offended him he spent the entire day taking her about the various buildings of the works vasya grew tired her temples began to throb she had a stitch in her side a backache if only she could go home lie down and go to sleep her head was still buzzing with the noise of the train wheels but volodya had just told her that there would be guests for dinner she was to receive them they came home entered the hall the errand boy opened the door and remained standing as though expecting a command looking at him vladimir took a notebook from his pocket scribbled a few words and gave the note to the boy now hurry vasya so there ll be no delay you ll bring the answer to me personally understand he turned to vasya again looked at her with an odd expression on his face half guilty half inquiring what s the matter with you vasyuk why do you stare at me so his voice sounded uncertain nothing s the matter but the errand boy s name is vasya too yes don t you like the idea of there being two vasya s in my house can you imagine she s jealous but you needn t worry there s not another vasya like you in the world gently he put his arm about her gazed into her eyes and kissed her it was the first time he had caressed her all day they went into the bedroom arm in arm the dinner guests arrived savelyev and ivan ivanovitch the secretary of the administration savelyev was a tall lean man in a light gray suit his thin hair was neatly combed and he wore a seal ring on his index finger clever rather crafty eyes an unpleasant smile on his smooth shaven face as though he were watching everything and as if everything were the same to him as long as he was well off that s how it seemed to vasya when he met vasya he raised her hand to his lips she pulled it away i m not used to that as you say but i never object to kissing the hand of a young woman it s pleasant and the husband can t be jealous you must be very jealous vladimir ivanovitch confess as he spoke he slapped volodya s back vladimir laughed vasya is a model wife there s no need of being jealous of her so she doesn t follow her husband s example savelyev winked at vladimir and vladimir s eyes suddenly grew big and frightened i don t think i ve ever done anything to savelyev interrupted never mind we know how you are you married men i ve been through it myself but now i m leading a bachelor s life vasya didn t like savelyev didn t like him at all but volodya talked with him as with a friend about business about politics vasya wouldn t have discussed politics with this speculator wouldn t have laughed with him at the chairman of the executive committee she would have to reason with volodya persuade him to drop this friendship they had wine for dinner the secretary ivan ivanovitch had brought it in a basket they were worried about some large shipments that had failed to arrive and which they were afraid would come too late for the fair vasya listened trying to grasp the meaning of it all but it seemed to her that these things weren t so very important as if the main point were not being mentioned the throbbing and hammering of her temples bothered her and her eyes hurt if only the meal were over vladimir ordered the auto right after dinner he had to attend an important meeting concerning the shipment are you really going to the meeting today the day your wife came you ought to stay with her it s not nice of you vladimir ivanovitch savelyev looked at vladimir with a crooked smile impossible interrupted vladimir carefully lighting a cigarette he would have been glad to stay business you know savelyev could not refrain from saying there are two sides to everything and again vasya thought he was winking at vladimir laughing at him a disgusting speculator if i were in your place i d drop everything else today and spend the first evening with your wife your business won t run away vladimir didn t answer but picked up his cap angrily well nikanor platonovitch are we ready to go they drove off ivan ivanovitch going with them vasya was left alone alone in the great empty house that was so strange to her she went through the rooms dreary lonely cold she stood beside the window then she lay down on the bed with the silk quilt and fell asleep at once she awoke with a start it was dark lighting the lamp she glanced at the clock a quarter past twelve had she really slept so long past midnight and vladimir had not come in getting up vasya bathed her face and went into the dining room the supper table was set the light was burning the room was empty and still the rest of the house dark she went into the kitchen where marya semyonovna was straightening things hasn t vladimir ivanovitch returned no not yet does he always come back so late from his meetings it depends marya semyonovna was sullen and sparing with her words how about you are you waiting up for him aren t you going to bed vasya and i take turns one day he stays up the next day i do will vladimir have supper when he comes if he brings any guests i guess he ll have some otherwise he goes straight to his room vasya stayed a little while longer silent she saw that marya semyonovna was busy with her own affairs and paid no attention to her going back to the bedroom vasya opened the window a cool quiet spring night the air was filled with the strong perfume of the acacias the frogs croaked loudly curiously at first vasya thought they were night birds the sky was dark and dotted with many many twinkling stars vasya gazed into the dark garden looked up at the sky and stars her heart became calmer she forgot the speculator savelyev forgot the pain vladimir had involuntarily caused her during the day now she felt with all her soul that she had come to him to her beloved to help and guide him one who associates with nep people can not help leaving the right road that was why he had summoned her his friend and wife remembering how vladimir had arranged everything vasya was proud of him how energetic he was now she saw things in a different light everything seemed clearer more intelligible more cheerful than during the day vasya was so absorbed with her thoughts that she failed to hear either the car drawing up or vladimir walking over the rugs and carpets to her the sound of his voice made her start what were we thinking about so hard little vasyuk mine as vladimir bent over her his eyes seemed anxious and loving have you really come dear i ve been waiting so long she threw her arms about his neck vladimir picked her up as in the first months of their love and carried her through the room like an adored child vasya felt happy and gay volodya loved her loved her as always how silly she had been why had she felt hurt in the morning they drank tea together had an intimate and affectionate talk vasya pronounced her opinion of savelyev it s better not to be a friend of his vladimir did not deny it he admitted that he too had no respect for him but he was useful the whole business would have been impossible without him he had many connections from before and enjoyed the confidence of the merchants it was possible to come in contact with them through him volodya too had learned much from him frankly speaking he was not worth much as a man a genuine burshui but in business he was indispensable that was why volodya had defended him when the highest authorities the super clever fellows had arrested savelyev and he was highly esteemed in moscow the local authorities had been given a good calling down on his account yes but didn t you write me that his hands aren t clean how can i make it clear to you he s our representative of course he doesn t neglect himself but he s no worse than the others besides the other fellows dawdle about and do nothing while he works conscientiously and he knows his work likes it all this notwithstanding however vladimir promised to see less of him business was business but it didn t necessitate a friendship having finished their tea they returned to the bedroom arm in arm vladimir pressed vasya s head to his breast kissed her curls and spoke thoughtfully tenderly such a dear little head it ll always be mine won t it another friend like you vasya doesn t exist i love only you my vasya my little tomboy vasya woke up late vladimir had gone to work long before she didn t feel well she had shooting pains in her side felt feverish and was beginning to cough had she caught cold on the trip although it was a beautiful sunny day she wrapped a shawl about her she didn t want to move and didn t want to get up marya semyonovna came into the room stood in the doorway folded her hands before her and looked at vasya as though she were expecting something good morning marya semyonovna good morning was the dry response what will you order for dinner when he left vladimir ivanovitch said you d attend to everything you re having guests vasya was at a loss she had no idea what she should order at home in the community house she had had only such food as the state supplied seeing that vasya knew nothing whatever about such matters marya semyonovna suggested various dishes vasya agreed to everything but she inquired as to the cost wouldn t it be very dear marya semyonovna s mouth snapped shut well if you want a good dinner you can t save on it you can t have anything without money the communists have done away with the payoks do you have any money there s a little left from yesterday but not enough for today meat is expensive and we ll have to buy butter too so vladimir left you no money he left me nothing he only said go to vassilissa dementyevna and discuss everything with her what should she do now marya semyonovna stood there waiting for the money and would not go vasya had a little money left but the household would soon eat it up and she would be left without a kopek she didn t like that idea why don t you advance some of your money to me and then have vladimir ivanovitch give it back to you suggested marya semyonovna really that never occurred to me and the matter was settled when marya semyonovna had gone vasya went out into the garden she walked up and down the paths for a long time until she was tired she felt so exhausted lying down she took up a book and fell asleep over it vasya lay stretched on the bed her cheeks were burning her sleep was disturbed by dismal tormenting dreams waking she looked about fretfully why had she gone to sleep it would have been better to see the sights of the city she hadn t come to vladimir to be sick yet she hadn t the slightest desire to raise her head she closed her eyes and her thoughts immediately became confused it was no proper sleep not even a doze but she wasn t fully conscious either vassilissa dementyevna vladimir ivanovitch will come in for dinner any moment you should get dressed then i could make the bed he hates to see disorder in the house marya semyonovna was bending over vasya as though being the elder she wanted to correct her is it that late almost five and you haven t even had breakfast i wanted to wake you before but you were so sound asleep that s from the trip you haven t got over it yet it might be the trip or i may have caught cold i feel chilled you should put on your woollen dress it ll be warmer the little rag you re wearing isn t any good my suit turned out badly my husband didn t like it at all why do you say that it s not so bad there may be too many pleats on the hips and the waistline isn t just where it should be nowadays they re wearing the waistline i ve been a dressmaker too i know all about clothes just you let me remodel the skirt we ll change that dress so vladimir ivanovitch won t recognize it will it be ready by dinner time that s asking a little too much no we ll do it slowly we won t rush it now you put on your black skirt and wear the coat of your suit over it that ll look very well never before had vasya spent so much time before the mirror marya semyonovna was forever finding something to change here she fastened something with pins there she made some long stitches she found a lace collar too the effect was quite good simple yet elegant even vasya liked it what would vladimir say about it almost as soon as she was finished vladimir came with his guests an employe of the g p u what had been the cheka and his wife the ends of his mustache had been waxed to needle points he was foppishly dressed with tan boots that reached to his knees and that called himself a communist vasya didn t like him at all and his wife dressed up like a street walker she wore a thin dress white shoes and a fur scarf across her shoulders her fingers were glittering with rings vladimir kissed her hand jested with her what were they talking about she couldn t understand it it was all nonsense vladimir was bending over her gallantly his eyes flirting with hers vasya sat beside the man from the g p u he was a communist but she had no idea of what to say to him they had wine again vladimir touched glasses with the lady she whispered something to him and both laughed it annoyed vasya but he paid no attention to her as if she didn t belong to him queer she didn t like it jokingly they mentioned the fasts the lady said that she was religious and went to confession even though she did not fast how could that be a comrade of the g p u married to a believer vasya scowled she was out of humor because of vladimir too what sort of friends did he have toward the end of the meal ivan ivanovitch came in to tell them that savelyev had taken a box in the theatre and had invited them we ll go won t we vasya asked vladimir with savelyev vasya tried to catch his eyes but he pretended not to understand yes of course with nikanor platonovitch with the whole crowd they re giving a new operetta it ll amuse you no i won t go why not i don t feel quite well i must have caught cold on the trip vladimir looked closely at her really you don t look well vasya your eyes are quite sunken let me have your hand why it s terribly hot of course you can t go and i won t go either but why not do go the guests too persuaded vladimir and he gave in in the hall vladimir embraced vasya in the presence of the others and whispered in her ear you look unusually pretty today vasya he asked marya semyonovna to take care of vassilissa dementyevna go to bed right away vasya i ll be back soon i won t stay to the end they drove off vasya wandered about the rooms quite forlorn she didn t like this life she couldn t say just what was wrong with it but everything was new and unfamiliar and she was a stranger here no one had need of her vladimir might love her but he thought of her so little he had put his arms around her kissed her and gone away it was different when he had to go to a meeting to work but this time it was the theatre why had he gone without her hadn t he seen enough of the theatre during the winter something was troubling vasya haunting her she couldn t express it she felt ill at ease i ll stay here a week she decided i ll see how things stand with volodya and then i ll go but there was the rub where would she go back to the community house her room there her attic under the roof was gone her friend grusha the seamstress was living in it besides the fedosseyevs were there there would be gossip and worry once more she would have to fight everybody for the house and she felt too worn out for that besides she had lost faith in the soundness of the proposition and that was the most important point no she had no place where she could go this thought made her heart even heavier stabbed it as with a steel blade vasya was cold shivering she drew her hands into her sleeves she wandered through the dark empty rooms she felt as if this strange house were preparing sorrow for her a lurking disaster a premonition could a communist believe in premonitions but it must be that else why this melancholy this infinite nameless fruitless melancholy chapter vii vladimir came home early as he had promised vasya was in bed he sat down beside her and inquired how she felt he looked into her eyes as he spoke and his grave sad gaze puzzled vasya his eyes seemed to bespeak suffering what s the trouble volodya you re so gloomy burying his head in the pillow beside her volodya spoke in a despondent tone life isn t a bed of roses vasya you don t know how hard it is for me you see only one side of my life and you refuse to understand if you could read my heart how hard i tried all winter you wouldn t condemn me you d pity me you re so good vasya she stroked his head quieted him and though she felt sorry for him her heart was full of joy she felt that they had the same thought had suffered the same pain it wasn t easy for a proletarian to act like a manager she told him so but volodya shook his head mournfully it s not only that vasya not only that there s something else that torments me that lets me have no peace are they plotting against you volodya remained silent it seemed that he wanted to say something but couldn t make up his mind vasya put her arms about him tell me what s bothering you dear she laid her head on his shoulder what smells so of perfume when did you put on perfume raising her head she looked at him perfume volodya seemed embarrassed he withdrew a bit i probably got it with my shave today the barber must have put it on vladimir got up lit a cigarette slowly carefully and left vasya he absolutely had to look through some papers that evening vasya coughed a little she felt rather ill and feverish had shooting pains in her side vladimir noticed it although she tried to control herself in his presence her coughing disturbed him and he had his bed made on the sofa in the drawing room the days dragged on it was so dreary she had nothing to do only little household worries now and then vladimir was trying to save but insisted on everything being just as it should be vasya gave her little reserve to the household for she didn t like it when volodya rebuked her have you really used up all your housekeeping money it s impossible to get enough for you women as if it were vasya who invited guests and wanted three courses for dinner however she had no cause to complain of vladimir he was very solicitous in other ways he was worried about vasya s health and had gone for the doctor himself the diagnosis was general debility and the right lung was affected she was ordered to lie in the sun as much as possible and to eat nourishing food vladimir was always inquiring whether she was doing everything the doctor had ordered marya semyonovna was to see to it that vasya had her meals at the proper time he had procured cocoa for her and had brought a chaise longue for the garden so that she could warm herself in the sun vladimir seemed very anxious about her when he came home he went to her immediately they didn t see much of each other for vladimir was very busy just then it was a time of feverish work the fair was to open soon vladimir seemed worried thoughtful and rather depressed lying on her chaise longue on the little lawn vasya sunned herself like a lizard and enjoyed life she turned over from one side to the other grew tanned as a little gypsy a queer life no work no cares but no joy either like a dream she was always thinking now now i ll wake up and i ll be back home in the community house she thought once more of the housing bureau the comrades stepan alexeyevitch grusha even of the fedosseyevs it had been a trying life but it had been happier she was waiting for vladimir he had promised to come home earlier that day vasya had the feeling that today she would be able to talk with him to have a good heart to heart talk but day passed after day and they never had that talk there were always guests or pressing work savelyev no longer visited them nor the usual guests but members of the administration who were strange and uninteresting to vasya their conversation consisted only of consignments and unloadings of packing and invoices of sales and rising prices vasya knew that all this was essential for the republic that the national economy could not be built up without an exchange of goods but it bored her to listen to it when she turned the conversation to party matters to bucharin s article or the newspaper reports about the german communists they listened to her and returned to their subject shipments consignments net and gross vladimir wasn t bored the comrades brought him to life he debated with them let them advise him only when he was alone with her with vasya did he grow downcast he would sigh pat her hands and look at her unhappily he didn t ask for her help didn t complain what could be bothering him the intrigues against him seemed to have come to an end she had heard nothing of them since her arrival but what gave him such low spirits he surely didn t think that vasya might die this idea gladdened her so he must love her true he spent little time with her but she hadn t spoiled him either when he had been her guest she too had been on the go all day had hardly had time to think of her man but she loved him no less for all that lying on her chaise longue vasya was delighted with the treetops standing out against the blue sky the summer breeze gently swayed them as with a caress the crickets were chirping in the grass the birds were singing loudly in the bushes getting up vasya walked along the grass covered path to a lilac bush in full bloom how sweet it smelled she plucked a branch buzz z z a bee flew past her settled down on a purple mass and dusted off its wings well well how brave you are aren t you afraid of people laughed vasya and suddenly she felt happy so free that she was amazed at herself she looked around as if she were seeing the garden for the first time the green grass the strong perfume the purple lilacs the little pond covered with duck weed full of frogs croaking calling to one another vasya didn t dare move she was afraid that this sudden joy this bright light winged joy might fly out of her heart it was as if she had never known or felt or understood the meaning of life before but now she had grasped it no despondency no rushing about no work no joy no pushing toward a goal but life pure and simple life like the life of the bee circling over the lilacs like the life of the birds singing in the trees like the life of the crickets chirping in the grass life life life why couldn t one spend all one s life among the lilacs why couldn t man be like all of god s creatures god s she was angry with herself since when was she thinking of god that was the result of her idleness of her burshui life of volodya s good food she might easily become a real nep girl if she continued this way vasya hurried into the house she was afraid of becoming soft but the joyful feeling stayed with her she was in high spirits had she grown stronger regained her health hardly had vasya come into the bedroom and put the lilacs into the vase when vladimir drove up in the car he hurried over to her now they ve begun they ve let me alone long enough these gossiping schemers now they ve found new energy to dig up old matters they ve just summoned me before the supervisory commission they re bringing an action against me but we ll see we ll see who ll come out ahead vladimir was running about the room one hand at his back a sign of agitation his anarchism had been thrown up to him too and lack of discipline and the devil alone knew what more here he was killing himself with work to get things going but instead of helping those fellows of the executive committee were only putting spokes in his wheels if they keep on with this persecution i ll leave the party i ll leave it of my own accord they needn t threaten me with expulsion vasya saw it as a serious matter she felt anxious oppressed was this the lurking disaster but she gave no sign of her thoughts instead she tried to calm vladimir to bring him to reason and your beloved stepan alexeyevitch he s a fine fellow they asked him about me and if you please he could think of nothing better than to praise my work and say that for the rest i m afflicted with self complacency and moral instability what sort of priests are they judging a man not by his work and actions but by his morals i don t live as a communist do they want to order me to become a monk are they any better now look they re not dragging the head of the propaganda division into court although he deserted his wife and three children and married a common street walker do you think that s right should a communist act like that why do they expect me to live like an ascetic what business of theirs is my private life anyway here vasya no longer agreed with vladimir the c p was right it was not in keeping with the dignity of a communist to imitate the burshuis a communist and a manager besides must lead an exemplary life but where the devil do you find me to blame of what does my non communism consist of my refusing to live in filth of my work forcing me to know every muckworm why don t they prescribe whom one may invite into one s house how many chairs one may have how many pairs of pants a communist may own vladimir was raging he disputed with vasya but she was grateful for the opportunity to speak out everything she had been keeping in her heart she didn t know herself just what was wrong but it seemed to her that vladimir s life and actions were not those of a communist vladimir was trying to say that business would not go as well if there were no mirrors or rugs in the manager s home but she didn t believe it she wasn t convinced that it was necessary to be good friends with savelyev or that business went better because vladimir kissed every woman s hand so you agree with them i knew it i thought so you didn t come as my friend but as my judge you join in the chorus and now i know that you despise me as the others do why don t you say so openly why do you suppress your rage why do you torment me vladimir was livid his eyes were flashing his voice was full of fury and indignation vasya did not understand why did he flare up so wasn t it permitted to contradict him nowadays such conceit if only he wouldn t have cause to regret it later oh vasya vasya i didn t think that of you i didn t suppose you d desert me in my need but i see i was mistaken so let everything go to the devil if i m destined to perish all right then at least everything ll be over he brought down his fist on the table upsetting the vase the fragrant purple masses fell to the floor a shining rivulet of water flowed over the silk scarf now look what you ve done waving her away vladimir went to the window he stared out sullenly looking at him vasya felt great pity for him as usual it wasn t easy for him but things were hard for every proletarian it was difficult to see one s way to know what was right what was permissible let s stop volodya why are you so discouraged it s too soon for that this matter still has to be investigated and you ve committed no crime so it s only a question of your insubordination just you wait i ll go to the committee myself and try to find out what the trouble is everything ll be set to rights again standing beside vladimir she laid her hand on his shoulder and tried to look into his face but he seemed not to notice stood there gloomily absorbed in his thoughts he hadn t heard her at all what was the matter with him why were they so strange to each other so little like comrades vasya brooded silently all the joy had gone out of her heart there remained only anxiety dull oppressive anxiety the next day vasya went to the party committee the more she had questioned vladimir the more alarmed she had become though the accusations seemed biased they were not to be taken lightly how would the matter turn out vasya hurried through the strange city asking the way of passers by but wasting not a glance on the sights she wanted to get to the party committee as quickly as possible she couldn t get rid of her alarm it was in a separate large building the red flag flying over the entrance the sign beside the door seemed so familiar made her feel as if she were at home in her own province and suddenly she was happy yearned to see her own people she didn t consider the comrades who visited vladimir members of the party she asked for the chairman s office the boy at the information table gave her directions write down your name and why you ve come it s possible that he ll see you today but you might have to wait till thursday what sort of bureaucracy was that vasya didn t like it but there was nothing she could do about it sitting down at a table she filled out the blank here take this to the secretary the information clerk handed the paper to the office boy go up the stairs turn to your left that ll bring you to the waiting room just take a seat there he uttered these directions in a bored voice suddenly he woke up manyka manyka how did you get here she was a half grown girl wearing a short skirt and fashionable hat her eyes sparkled coquettishly i m going to see some friends why shouldn t i come to your party committee disapprovingly vasya appraised her as a street walker in the old days such a creature wasn t allowed to visit friends in party headquarters vasya walked through the long bright hall employes male and female hurried past her there was no inactivity everybody was busy only she was superfluous in the waiting room she was received by the attendant clerk a beardless youth with an important air he asked for her name and looked it up in a record book kept by a hunchback it s long before your turn your business isn t urgent you ll have to wait vasya sat down in the back there were others waiting too among them several laborers with peaked miserable faces and threadbare coats they were engaged in an animated discussion evidently a delegation a tall well dressed gentleman with glasses a specialist of course was absorbed in the reading of an old newspaper a little old woman a working woman with a waterproof shawl was sitting there patiently sighing then there was a red guard a jolly young fellow in the pink of health a peasant in a short jacket and beside him a pope in his cassock why might he be there it s your turn father said the attendant showing him into the chairman s office he belongs to the living church he explained to the rest a very clever fellow he can be useful to us various clerks came in bob haired communist girls in short worn out skirts bustling back and forth bringing papers to sign making inquiries of the attendant they whispered to him and ran away again a very fashionably dressed woman came in she behaved like a fine lady but actually she was the wife of a prominent party worker and didn t belong to the party herself vasya knew her she asked to be shown in before her turn she had a note from a member of the central committee having come from moscow she had no time to wait the attendant was firm but the letterhead of the c c seemed to shake him finally he said he could not break the rules if it was a personal matter she would please wait her turn the pseudo lady as vasya thought of her was indignant she couldn t understand these provincial regulations in moscow she would have been given an audience immediately in moscow they were fighting against bureaucracy but here forever inventing new rules officials she sat down deeply offended and carefully smoothed her dress a corpulent man rushed in noisily his cap on the back of his head his overcoat unbuttoned a nep fellow thought vasya i say comrade what sort of system do you have here my time is valuable we re just making a shipment and they re delaying me with all sorts of nonsense want me to fill out blanks announce me konrashev and he threw back his head with a self satisfied air as though he were lenin himself vasya felt all her old hatred of the burshuis boiling up in her that fellow ought to be arrested to be brought to court that monkey face that impudent monkey face the attendant apologized but it couldn t be done rules the nep fellow refused to listen he became insistent in his demands and won his point the secretary went into the other room to announce him but he returned with fresh apologies the chairman asks that you take a seat he has to see two others before you on urgent business what the devil sort of system is this and they want a fellow to do business with them they demand everything of us and make threats besides call us saboteurs i d like to know who is committing sabotage here he wiped off his perspiration with his handkerchief the pseudo lady nodded in approbation the bespectacled gentleman peered disapprovingly at her from behind his paper the laborers were busy with their own affairs as if they hadn t noticed the noisy nep fellow they were the next to be called in after them the specialist with the glasses had his turn it was a tiresome wait going to the window she looked down into a garden where two children were running about chasing a dog their high clear voices were audible upstairs pull bobka s tail then he ll howl but he doesn t bite here bobka catch him catch bobka now it was vasya s turn the chairman was a small man hardly visible behind his big desk he wore a pointed beard and glasses he was so emaciated that his shoulder bones stood out through his coat he glanced ungraciously at vasya and gave her his hand without looking up what do you want something personal he spoke briefly dryly as if she had made a plea i ve come to report at headquarters it would be better not to mention volodya s affair at first thought vasya he d never meet her half way i came here a little while ago so i have heard are you here for any length of time i have a two months leave of absence but i may stay here longer because of my delicate health are you simply resting or do you want some work as he spoke he didn t look at vasya but arranged his papers as if to show her that he had no time for idle talk i wouldn t accept any regular position but you could use me in your propaganda work i could use you yes we re beginning the work of transition to a local budget next week didn t i hear that you have specialized in housing problems again he glanced at vasya only to return to his papers i ve worked in the housing bureau for two years i ve organized some community houses ah that sounds interesting you must teach us how to make the community houses self supporting vasya shook her head i can t do that when we wanted to become self supporting everything went to pieces a community house is on the order of a school to develop the communist spirit but you see this isn t the time for such things give us a reasonable idea of the cost a financial estimate to take the burden off the state budget but how can you want to combine the housing question with education we have schools and universities for that the chairman smiled a very superior smile that irritated vasya suddenly she rose good day comrade good bye this time he looked more carefully at her vasya too looked coolly into his eyes you might go to the propaganda department and register there then you could stop in the women s division they always need workers there i also wanted to ask you how the matter of vladimir ivanovitch stands as she asked this she looked keenly at the chairman he too had his finger in the pie why what could i tell you wrinkling his forehead the chairman shifted his cigarette to the corner of his crooked mouth it s quite serious i ve heard of you that your standing in the party is very good but i m not the right man to tell you anything about vladimir ivanovitch of what do you accuse him vladimir ivanovitch has done nothing criminal couldn t do anything of that sort what do you mean by criminal but i ve nothing to do with this business try to find out something from the s c good bye he nodded to her and again buried himself in his papers don t bother me i m busy scowling furious vasya left the chairman even a non communist wasn t given such a reception in her province she had come to her people and had been treated like a stranger vladimir was right they had become officials with the manner of military governors vasya walked on thoughtfully without even noticing that she had come on a man from home michailo pavlovitch a worker in the machinery division of the factory where vasya had been employed by all the saints what do i see the fair vassilissa good morning my dear michailo pavlovitch they embraced and kissed are you visiting your husband and what are you doing here i m cleaning up the party i m a member of the s c and we re forever cleaning up but we can t get rid of all the muck he laughed into his red beard his eyes were warm cordial still good through and through as he always had been both were delighted asked and answered questions michailo pavlovitch took vasya to his cell beside the main entrance in the good old days the janitor had lived there michailo pavlovitch had settled there temporarily on his arrival and had stayed there an insignificant little room a bed a basket containing his personal belongings two chairs and a table covered with newspapers glasses and tobacco they were glad to have met each other and their conversation flowed on smoothly they spoke of friends and comrades provincial questions came up they discussed what was sound and what rotten they spoke of the nep too michailo pavlovitch was thoroughly sick of the nep nor could he stand the chairman of the provincial committee a little man but very proud of himself i me and company of course he s a hard worker energetic and not stupid but he wants to be everything he d like to be chairman of the light that comes in through the window the workers can t stomach that they say that the congress has decided on democratization but that our bureaucracy has only increased there is more fawning and a great deal of gossip they re forming cliques that disturb our work and undermine the authority of the party it s the chairman s job to hold them all together impartially like a father but he drives people apart by the way michailo pavlovitch how do vladimir s affairs stand what is he accused of is it serious tell me as a friend michailo pavlovitch stroked his red beard he thought for a while before he answered in itself the matter isn t worth a straw if our communists were to be brought to court for such things almost all of them would have to be condemned the whole trouble is that vladimir ivanovitch couldn t agree with the chairman from the very beginning each insisted on his rights the chairman issued orders which vladimir ivanovitch did not follow saying that they were the business of the party and did not concern him i m not your subordinate i m connected with the economic organization only let that judge whether i do my work properly there were conflicts and the matter was taken up in moscow where some supported the chairman while others defended the manager no definite decision was reached both were right so matters went from bad to worse neither would give in both would send denunciatory letters to moscow at every opportunity after things had gone on that way a while there came a commission from moscow to smooth over the quarrel they worked out a strict agreement but the moment the commission had gone the squabbling began all over again now the matter was before the s c michailo pavlovitch would try to settle it peaceably the manager was working in his own domain the central committee was satisfied and there really was nothing with which he could be charged there couldn t be michailo was convinced of that didn t he know the american the anarchist he still remembered how they had established the soviet together in how they had worked together and as for his living in great style his unexemplary conduct and his uncomradelike manner were any of them without blame in this respect however the chairman and the other members of the commission were all for going into the matter for making an example of the manager and for showing that the party didn t take such things lightly to discourage others from doing the same but what does vladimir ivanovitch do is it because his house is nicely furnished but that isn t his own it belongs to the state and has been put at the disposal of the manager it s not only the furnishings people are wondering where he gets the means to support two households how has he two households do you think that vladimir has been supporting me how could you imagine such a thing if you really want to know i ve even contributed my own money to the household because vladimir can t manage with his his work compels us to receive people to have dinner guests as michailo pavlovitch listened to vasya she thought she read pity of some sort in his eyes she didn t like that why should he pity her because she was defending the anarchist long ago when she had first become associated with vladimir michailo pavlovitch had opposed her election why are you against me don t you believe me how could you think that i would press him for money i m not speaking of you my darling but it s not proper for him to have such objectionable friends he looked searchingly at vasya as he spoke are you alluding to savelyev yes savelyev too and the others savelyev doesn t come to us any more vladimir has promised me not to have any but business relations with him and as for the others it s all in his work there are a great many people he doesn t like who are strangers to us but what can he do they re in the business shareholders or technicians ye e es drawled michailo pavlovitch thoughtfully stroking his beard vasya told him that she too couldn t understand many things sometimes she didn t know herself what was right and what was wrong what was permissible and what should a communist not do people had changed and so had the work she would have liked to stay longer with her friend but michailo was sent for to go to the s c as they parted they arranged that michailo pavlovitch would acquaint vasya with his factory boys as for the question of the manager he would think it over but she should understand this if vladimir would go on that way he would run the risk of expulsion chapter viii at last my tomboy s come back where were you fighting at party headquarters what did they say there vladimir met vasya on the stairs he must have been waiting for her at the window he listened to vasya s report walking up and down the room and smoking his face was worried you say they re accusing me of keeping up two households and suppose i had five households what business is it of theirs the hypocrites my accounts are in order i m not stealing any goods or accepting any bribes what in the world do they want and again vasya didn t bother about the significance of two households she remained firm concerning savelyev that would have to stop let him go to the office but keep him out of the house she also inquired about the workingmen was it really true that vladimir was foul mouthed and abusive that s fiction pure and simple nonsense defamation of course it happens that i shout at them or even curse them but it s all for the cause and never without a reason they can t be left to themselves especially the shippers a lazy dull witted group vasya didn t tell vladimir that he was threatened with expulsion he was sufficiently depressed without that but now she determined to organize the household properly simpler food no more unnecessary guests vladimir would have to get rid of the horse he had bought why did he need a horse when he had the car vladimir flared up again it was a well broken saddle horse would even take a side saddle it s impossible to get such a thing nowadays it was a special opportunity and a great bargain today a horse represents capital capital have you any intention of becoming a capitalist don t joke that way vladimir you may have to weep over it later do you think they ll throw me out of the party what s become of the party that it s expelling people for moral reasons let them do it i ll work with the economic organization seeing that his temper was running away with him vasya did not contradict she only insisted that everything would have to be changed everything would have to become simpler quieter and most important of all they would have to avoid all objectionable relationships she promised to speak with michailo pavlovitch again if it came to the worst she would go to see toporkov in moscow sitting there on the window sill vasya looked so pale and thin nothing but eyes and even her eyes were not happy vladimir looked at her throwing his cigarette to the floor he walked over to her put his arms about her and pressed her close close vasya you dear friend of mine don t desert me vasya not now help me advise me i know that i m to blame not before them before you he laid his head on her knee like a little boy how are you to blame volodya he hesitated don t you understand vasya don t you feel it because you re harming yourself because you re betraying your proletarianism don t accuse yourself before me but before yourself oh vasya vasya vladimir turned away as though he were disappointed abruptly changing the subject he asked is dinner ready i want to eat i haven t had a bite since morning vasya was returning from a meeting she was working with the girls of the hemp binding works and was helping the woman in charge of the organization work to get the factory going she was working with the crowd again quite naturally as if she were at home michailo pavlovitch saw a good deal of her and she had become friends with his boys the group was not exactly homogeneous but they stuck together fought against the chairman of the provincial committee and objected to the policy of the economists their admiration was centered on a former workingman who had become the manager of the steel foundry he was one of their own people he hadn t dissociated himself from the crowd or taken on the manner of a military governor vladimir s case had not yet come up for trial michailo pavlovitch said that new material had come in and that it wasn t favorable he advised vasya to warn vladimir he really must be more cautious must avoid savelyev savelyev s reputation wasn t of the best let the economists protest as much as they wanted the g p u wouldn t permit him to run about at large much longer vasya s mind was troubled she was suffering for vladimir particularly just now he was working from morning to night and as soon as he came home he would settle down with his accounts the central administration had ordered him to reorganize the bookkeeping system he had taken on a specialist a bank employee to help him and the two of them would be bending over the books till three o clock in the morning vladimir had grown thin and did not sleep well it was only natural with his twofold cares he held a responsible post and had the intrigues and gossip to worry about besides vasya s heart ached for him it was overflowing with tenderness for him they received no more guests nor was anything heard of savelyev he must have gone away it was better thus vladimir had stopped going to the theatre no longer visited his friends he spent all his evenings at home troubled silent gloomy vasya didn t know how to take his mind off his worries how to make his work easier for her man her friend she could forget him only in the hemp binding works while she worked for the party the factory girls led a wretched life they earned very little there had been no time to look over the rates and the pay was in arrears the administration was not able to manage silly fools vasya besieged them stood up for the interests of the shop girls she had set their union going and had brought the matter as far as the accounting department she was kept very busy at the factory she would forget everything else and the day would be over before she realized it one evening vasya was walking home with the organizer lisa sorokina lisa was a working girl young and sensible vasya liked her as they walked they worked out a plan whom should they arouse to action so that the accounting department would be given a push forward in the matter they reached vasya s house almost before she knew it as she went in vladimir came to meet her he was quite different now gay his eyes shining sparkling with delight the moment vasya came in he put his arms around her congratulate me vasyuk there s a letter from moscow i m getting a new position an advancement i m to be at the head of an entire district we ll have to stay here about two months longer until i ve finished up everything and then we ll see what our s c will do what will the chairman say don t be too happy about it the action against you might come in between nonsense the central administration wouldn t let them insult me any more you don t realize that i ve become a most important personality elated as a boy he fondled vasya and kissed her you tireless tomboy of mine i m so happy that i ve brought a present for you too he took her into the bedroom some blue silk and white batiste lay on the bed here s some blue silk for a dress dress yourself nicely sweetheart that grayish blue will become you and here s some batiste for underwear for underwear what in the world are you thinking of volodyka vasya laughed this material for underwear it s just the right thing for that soft white batiste for ladies underwear you ought to stop wearing that sackcloth stuff it makes you look like a bag of flour no i d rather have some blouses made of it but as for the silk you might just as well have not bought it though it s pretty and i suppose you paid cash for it why are you such a spendthrift vasya shook her head volodya s presents gave her no joy and they would accuse him of extravagance again but she didn t want to hurt his feelings don t you like it asked vladimir the material s pretty of course but what can i do with it use your judgment is it for the theatre do you want me to go to the theatre with you as the manager s lady vasya laughed as she tried to picture herself in this blue dress but i thank you anyway thank you for your kindness and your love rising to her toes she embraced vladimir and kissed him long fervently at least you haven t forgotten how to kiss vasyuk and i was beginning to think you had stopped loving me you ve exiled me from the bedroom you never come to me never make love to me but we haven t time for such things and you aren t in the mood for them and you still love me i you do you want me to remind you how we used to love each other they laughed the two of them as if they had been separated and now had found each other again vasya was hurrying to the factory on the stairs it occurred to her that she had forgotten bucharin s a b c of communism it was in volodya s book case hurrying back to the study she opened the glass door a package fell on the floor the paper came undone vasya stooped down and felt as if her heart would stop beating it was a piece of the silk vladimir had given her a piece of the same batiste and a bundle of lace and inserts besides why for whom dimly she remembered he s keeping up two households impossible vasya was afraid to think of it afraid to look the truth in the face but her jealousy was aroused he s keeping up two households he was so variable now he would be distant would hardly look at her then again he would be inordinately affectionate as if to make good a fault she remembered that volodya always smelled of perfume when he returned from the theatre she recalled how he would always preen himself before the mirror when he went out in the evening and she thought again of the long forgotten nurse with the full lips of that bed vasya s eyes grew dim her hands seemed petrified her heart was heavy with unspeakable pain volodya her beloved her comrade was betraying her his friend his vasyuk he had other women behind her back while she was there it would have been different if they had not been together she would ask him no questions then but this way he caressed vasya and she felt that they were one felt it with all her heart with all her love and tenderness what could it mean didn t he love her any more that was impossible vasya s heart couldn t believe in such anguish she sought for a straw to which to cling if he no longer loved her how could he be so loving and solicitous would he have called her anyway how could such a thing happen how could volodya stop loving her they were so close to each other so intimately bound up with each other they were friends comrades what hadn t they gone through together and now again disaster was looming vasya didn t believe in it refused to believe in it but the serpent of jealousy dripped its venom into her heart why had he spent so little time at home why was he so melancholy so gloomy why didn t vasya delight him as before why had he sought an excuse her cough to sleep alone the serpent s fangs were sharp so sharp that vasya almost moaned with pain she didn t want to hear its hissing vladimir loved her loved vasya he loved her otherwise would he caress her as he had yesterday and this material might be intended for someone else volodya might have bought it for somebody how did she know that the package belonged to him there was no evidence she had simply imagined it vasya was ashamed of her suspicion of having tried to check up on her husband like an old woman but the serpent of jealousy still was gnawing at her keep still you evil snake when vladimir would come back she would ask him would have a long talk with him so that everything would be explained and she would know the truth taking up the a b c she hastened to the hemp binding works for it had become very late vasya was hurrying homeward she was afraid she would be late for dinner at the factory the serpent in her heart had remained still but hardly had she reached the street when it stirred again he s keeping up two households two pieces of silk two pieces of batiste how did volodya know that this material was used for underwear and who used it girls of easy virtue and nep women with easily earned money what had he called vasya s things sackcloth flour bags but what difference could underwear make hadn t he loved her in this underwear and in the old days he wouldn t have left her alone the day she came a meeting he had said but why had he dressed so carefully before the mirror why had he smelled of perfume why did he no longer look at vasya with tenderly mischievous eyes she would ask him when she got home this is how matters stand tell me the truth for whom is the material why did you hide it in the book case if it had been bought for someone else he would have thrown it on the table no evasions no lies that i d never forgive vasya ran up the steps and rang the bell she was in a hurry the automobile was standing before the door so vladimir must be at home she would go to him at once and demand an answer she wouldn t forgive deception she wouldn t permit him to play with her as husbands played with their unloved lawfully wedded wives vasya became flushed with her anger why didn t someone open the door she heard the bolt being pushed back at last there are guests from moscow marya semyonovna told her six people and they re all supposed to get enough to eat that s not so easily done guests who are they she heard voices in the drawing room animated conversation vladimir was there too playing the host he introduced his wife vassilissa dementyevna the guests were members of the syndicate they had brought a new program for the work vassilissa would have liked to ask them for news from moscow and about the political litigation that everybody was interested in at the moment but marya semyonovna was in the doorway beckoning mysteriously calling vasya she must need help vasya the boy had been sent for wine ivan ivanovitch had gone to fetch entr es and the worthy marya semyonovna was in despair she had to cook and to set the table vasya would have to help her for vladimir wanted everything to be just so the table should look well both the women worked hard it was a good thing that ivan ivanovitch returned and also helped vasya had no time to think of the blue silk and the serpent in her heart gave no sign of life seemed to be gone vasya wanted only to help her man so that he would make a good impression on the members of the syndicate the errand boy vasya came back all out of breath with the wine ivan ivanovitch uncorked the bottles the table looked splendid enough for easter there were appetizers wines flowers morosov napkins silver cutlery the guests were asked to come in vladimir glanced anxiously at the table and seemed content but why didn t he at least look gratefully at vasya she had tried so hard she felt hurt offended vasya conversed with her guests but she could not stop thinking of that blue silk for whom was it intended for whom she glanced at volodya she saw him with different eyes as though he were a stranger and if he were close to her if he belonged to her he would have pitied her he would never have let that accursed serpent enter her heart vasya was tormented throughout the evening at night she had to put up the visitors she sent the errand boy for pillows and arranged a dormitory in the study there she couldn t help looking at that damned book case again and again the blue material was lying there for whom for whom she was exhausted she had served tea the guests spoke only of their own affairs of various kinds of goods of different methods of packing of specifications and calculations they were business men they had been merchants among them were two communists who were seeking their salvation in trade real red merchants vladimir grew animated he was proud of his business of being ahead of all the others his business was barely a month old but it was developing the merchants respect for him was evident everybody listened to him no one paid any attention to the other members of the administration vasya watched them under ordinary circumstances she would have been happy for vladimir but today he seemed a stranger business nothing but business not a thought of her nor did he see how weary her spirit was after this day and if he had deceived her lied to her might he not be a little crooked in business might not the party committee be justified in calling him to account and what didn t these syndicate people discuss if only she could be alone with vladimir if only she could find out something about the blue material vasya undressed for the night and waited for vladimir he was to sleep with her that night for the syndicate people had taken possession of all the other rooms she listened for his steps the guests had already said good night now he was only giving ivan ivanovitch instructions for the morning he was coming vasya s heart pounded her knees trembled she sat down on the bed she would ask him as soon as he came in but vladimir gave her no chance to ask her question he was too full of news himself he wanted her advice how should they reorganize the machine so as to strengthen the communists so that the members of the party would prevail over the members of the syndicate over the burshui advise me vasya think it over carefully tomorrow we ll go over the new project together but first you read over the program by yourself and think about it these bay windows would like to get the power they re secretly plotting against us proletarians let them plot we weren t born yesterday either it s our job to construct the machine so that nothing can be done without the party without the communists then why don t you follow the party regulations don t you often say that expulsion from the party isn t the worst thing that can happen to you that you can live without the party oh one can say so many things without meaning them laughed vladimir you understand that but how can one live without the party will we ever leave it vladimir spoke thoughtfully pulling off his shoes the while if only i had this stupid case off my chest and how we ll live vasya wonderfully you ll see what a model communist i ll be as soon as i m transferred to another district and i won t have any more fights with the chairman i ll be so good they ll canonize me volodya was happy not sulky as he had been so often in the last few days his eyes were again laughing mischievously let s go to sleep vladimir wanted to put out the light but vasya held his hand no wait i have to i want to ask you something she raised herself on her elbow the better to see his face her heart pounded her voice sounded curiously unfamiliar vladimir started go ahead what is it he was looking not at vasya but at the wall i wanted to ask you why do you have material lying in your book case silk and batiste silk do you mean the samples no not samples a piece a big piece exactly the same as the one you gave me for whom she stared into vladimir s face you want to know for whom it is can t you guess really no ivan ivanovitch asked me to get the same stuff for his fianc e he wants to have everything i have you know he copies me in everything he explained it so simply so calmly that the blood rushed to vasya s face she was ashamed of herself ivan ivanovitch his fianc e and i thought what did you think laughed vladimir turning to face her you dear sweet darling of mine my volodyka vasya kissed him how could she have thought of such a thing how could she have doubted him suspected her friend why what did you think oh you little detective such a cross examiner volodya put his arms about vasya but his eyes seemed worried and now to bed no more kissing we ll have a hard time getting through with our work tomorrow anyway on account of the guests we ll have to get up early he put out the light vasya felt a load off her heart but the moment he was asleep the serpent stirred again why did he call me a little detective and a cross examiner there must be something to be found out vladimir slept soundly but vasya lay there curled up like a porcupine wide awake staring into the dark to believe or not to believe to believe or not to believe the syndicate people had gone now vladimir s work was doubled the work of reorganization caused him endless worries but there had been a joyful compensation michailo pavlovitch had called vasya to his room and told her of some secret instructions from the central administration as the manager could not be accused of any real offense and as the whole thing practically amounted only to insubordination and improper behavior the matter was to be hushed up as quietly and unobtrusively as possible vasya drew a breath of relief almost fell back into her old habit of saying thank god she barely succeeded in controlling herself michailo pavlovitch was glad too on vasya s account he liked her and felt sorry for her vasya however was unsuccessful the accounting department had decided in favor of the management the girls of the hemp binding shop grew restless a strike seemed imminent working under the cloak of bolsheviki unaffiliated with the party the mensheviki were doing their best to fan the flames although she coughed and felt feverish she was at the works every day she fought against the management insisted demanded concessions then again she sought to calm the shop girls and her work absorbed her so completely that she forgot the blue silk entirely she had no time for it only once did the serpent in her heart give a sign of life it had gained a firm foothold there and wasn t easy to drive out this time it was the dog the white poodle vasya the boy had brought it home it wore a silk bow between its ears whose dog is that why did you bring it here where does it come from vasya replied that vladimir ivanovitch had given him orders to keep the dog in the house for the time being it belonged to savelyev who had gone out of town leaving the poodle alone and neglected in the empty house surprised vasya wondered about vladimir s sudden liking for dogs did he want to do savelyev a favor and her resentment against savelyev was aroused again why did vladimir continue being friends with him with this speculator this thief when vladimir came the poodle rushed to meet him as though it had found a long lost master petting it vladimir began to talk to it where does the dog come from volodya is it savelyev s why no it belongs to ivan ivanovitch s fianc e she s gone out of town and ivan ivanovitch asked me to keep it here for a while but vasya said it belongs to savelyev nonsense it s true that the dog was in savelyev s house for the past few days vasya took it from there that s why he thinks it belongs to savelyev vasya listened as if she understood everything clearly but the serpent stirred gripped her heart in its coils should she believe him the moment ivan ivanovitch came vasya flew at him whose poodle was it with great detail ivan ivanovitch told her of his fianc e who had asked him to care for her poodle but how could he do it he never was at home so he sent it to savelyev there however there were only the servants who would go away and lock the poodle in the house it might have been true but vasya didn t like the poodle vladimir ivanovitch had gone away for a few days something about the syndicate vasya was alone she had thought she would be lonely and sad but it was different though she was alone she seemed to feel happier more free she was relieved of the burden which in vladimir s presence weighted her down like a stone and she no longer felt the depressing disregard of volodya who ignored her as if she didn t exist at all she knew he was busy that his head was full of other things but her heart her silly woman s heart was sad longed for affection she was better off without vladimir when she was alone there was nothing to do about it she expected nothing listened for nothing didn t feel hurt she invited her friends to her house lisa sorokina the factory boys michailo pavlovitch she gave a supper party she was happy when she entertained her friends after supper they discussed party affairs went into the garden sang together it was beautiful everyone was gay but vasya most of all quite different this from the conversations with the syndicate people or with savelyev in the drawing room she hardly noticed how quickly the days of vladimir s absence passed he came home on an early morning train and found vasya at the tea table jumping to her feet vasya hurried to meet him he didn t kiss her but he pressed her hand to his lips for a long time when he raised his head she saw tears in his eyes her heart grew heavy what s the matter volodya has something happened again no vasya nothing s happened it s only life is so hard for me vasya i m so tired of it all he sat down at the table leaned his head on his hand and let his tears flow freely but what s the trouble volodya what is it please tell me dear you ll feel better will i vasya he asked wretchedly i ve been turning it over and over in my mind i ve been wondering i ve gone through so much vasya no things can t become better there s no way out and again vasya s heart was convulsed in an agony of fear don t torment me volodya tell me the truth i can t go on this way any longer i m tired i can t rest she could not go on for she began to cough there you re coughing again how can i talk to you was it a reproach or was it sorrow that she heard in volodya s voice and vasya coughed his annoyance plainly showing in his face vladimir lighted a cigarette why don t you drink some tea that might stop it he advised her no i ll take some of my medicine her fit of coughing over vasya gave vladimir some tea and he told her again in his ordinary tone how difficult it was to keep things going the shipping clerks had just raised a row they demanded higher pay for overtime although their usual wages had been reduced the syndicate was losing money on their account but they were threatening to strike if their pay was not raised possibly it was the work of agitators after all one could not see everything ivan ivanovitch came with his report the moment i stepped out of the train and you expect me to be happy i go away for a couple of days and i come back to find a fight on my hands what in the world do the other members of the administration do they shouldn t have let the matter go so far now there ll be trouble and the chairman has found something new too so that s why you said life was so hard and that there s no way out on account of the shipping clerks why of course what did you think puffing at his cigarette vladimir slowly stirred his tea and spoke of the dispute again how could it be smoothed over without a public scandal but vasya listened only half heartedly should she believe him had he really wept only on account of the shipping clerks it wasn t like him he had something else on his mind the blue silk vladimir might really be tired the s c had tormented him so that now every little thing could make him lose control of himself she was trying to convince herself to believe that vladimir s worries were of a purely business nature it was the members of the administration who were to blame for this business of the shipping clerks chapter ix at last vasya had carried her point at the hemp binding works she had succeeded in obtaining concessions from the management the shop girls were jubilant escorted vasya to her door but she knew that matters would never have turned out so well without the chairman she had come to esteem him he was inflexible and anything but indulgent toward the economists when she reached her house vasya found the entire courtyard full of shipping clerks a babel of voices disputing shouting the highest rates no concessions or we ll stop work let the managers and office clerks do the loading vasya mingled with the crowd listening asking questions they recognized her surrounded her drowned her voice everybody wanted to tell her all about it at once their pay was too low and they got nothing for overtime the accounts were not drawn up correctly they crowded about vasya uttered threats against the management wasn t she the manager s wife let her explain the whole business to him there could be no family considerations in a case of this sort vasya listened and asked questions she knew and understood their grievances well the managers and office employes were well treated and well fed but the shipping clerks were slaves their children had nothing to wear things couldn t be permitted to go on that way the union would have to exert pressure on the management nothing could be done without organization and a program the leaders came forward to arrive at an understanding with vasya they would state their demands on paper and if the management were to refuse all concessions they would appeal directly to the accounting department vasya s blood was up forgetting her position as the manager s wife she took the shipping clerks cause as her own how could she help supporting her own people with word and deed they were an inexperienced mob inefficiently led she asked the leaders into the house there to formulate their demands they went in the shipping clerks looking askance at the manager s house furnishings as they went through the reception rooms into vasya s bedroom only then it occurred to vasya that she should not have brought the men into the house but it was too late to turn back they sat down at vasya s table and drew up their demands there was less noise in the courtyard no more shouting the men had separated into groups were talking and smoking then suddenly the uproar began again an auto had stopped before the house the manager he was entering the courtyard what sort of business is this you re holding a meeting here you ve come here to make threats you re dissatisfied vladimir s voice rumbled like thunder i haven t the slightest intention of negotiating with you here this is my private residence go to the office you don t like the accounting go to the union the management has nothing to do with that it has other things to worry about you re going to strike that s your affair go ahead and strike if the union says so but get out of here this very moment i won t listen to you i ll see you in the office vladimir banged the door and going through the house went directly to vasya to the bedroom when he came in he stopped as though paralyzed vasya was sitting at the table with the shipping clerks drawing up demands and what s this who let you in here how did you dare come in here without permission get out of here get out but vladimir ivanovitch we didn t come in on our own hook your wife get out i say or vladimir was white as a sheet he was raising his arm the men retreated toward the door are you crazy vladimir how dare you i called them in stop comrades where are you going vasya ran after them but vladimir stepped in her way and grasped her arm so tightly that she cried out you invited them who gave you permission who asked you to meddle in my affairs you re not responsible to the syndicate if you want to start any strikes go to your hemp binding works oh so you re driving me away because i m siding with my brothers because i want the truth because i don t consider your managerial interests because i lower your bonus you should be ashamed of yourself you disgusting hypocrite vasya felt as if he had lashed her with a whip disgusting she vasya was disgusting they faced each other furiously like enemies but her heart was filled with agonizing excruciating pain was her happiness gone forever the shipping clerks had dispersed and vladimir had gone to the office lying across the bed her face buried in the quilt vasya was letting her tears wet the silk but her sorrow could not be relieved by tears she was heart broken not at his having called her disgusting but at their estrangement their inability to understand each other like enemies in two hostile camps the days that followed were dismal cheerless vladimir spent much time at home but what good did that do they were just like strangers spoke only when it was absolutely necessary each lived his own life vasya was ill again ivan ivanovitch had gone for the doctor who had ordered a complete rest for her and had forbidden all excitement vladimir was very busy with his work he would sit up half the night in his study with ivan ivanovitch and the bookkeeper they would come out for supper but their thoughts were wrapped in their business they were taciturn and in bad humor occasionally lisa sorokina would visit vasya to tell her about the hemp binding works the girls were sorry that she was ill yet her illness did not distress vasya as much as the knowledge that she and volodya had become estranged neither could forget the quarrel about the shipping clerks neither could forgive the other vasya thought of going home to her province she wanted to be back home but where could she go grusha was living in her attic under the roof it would be very crowded for two she could not think of going to her parents to recuperate for they would weep over her and would rail against the bolsheviki where then vasya wrote to grusha asking her to get a room for her and she wrote to stepan alexeyevitch asking him to procure some work for her with the party with the masses she would go as soon as she heard from them why should she stay here no one needed her volodya would get along without her the days dragged slowly heavily it was midsummer the cherries in the garden were ripe the plums were covered with a purplish bloom the lilies white and delicate shone on their tall dewy stalks but nothing delighted vasya now as she wandered through the garden she would remember how she had lain in the chaise longue in the spring how glad she had been that she was alive and the memory made her heart even heavier she felt as if she had been quite another vasya then a young confiding vasya something had gone out of her what was it she didn t know exactly but this much was certain it had gone out of her and would never come back sometimes vladimir would stand at the window and watch vasya walking about the garden indifferent drooping he would stand at the window a while then turning away abruptly would return to ivan ivanovitch and his work then vasya would sigh with fresh disappointment she had expected him to come down to her to the garden and he hadn t come there it was it was clear that he had no more feeling for her to him business was more important than the anguish of a woman s heart some noise woke vasya it was morning vladimir was rummaging in his wardrobe taking out something what are you doing there so early volodya i have to meet a train there s a consignment coming in must you go yourself i have to supervise vladimir was standing before the mirror putting on his new tie but he couldn t quite manage it as vasya looked at him she suddenly felt once more that he was so close so deeply bound to her come here volodya let me help you he came obediently sat down on the bed vasya made his tie they looked at each other and suddenly without a word they were in each other s arms my little vasyuk my darling it hurts so to live beside you and yet so terribly far away can t it be different he asked plaintively pressing vasya s curly head to his breast do you think it doesn t hurt me i don t want to live any more but why do we quarrel vasyuk i don t know there s some barrier between us no vasya no nothing can stand between us my heart is all yours only yours and you haven t stopped loving me you silly little thing he kissed her come let s stop quarreling it s stupid and makes both of us suffer and i can t afford to lose you vasya i can t live without you so now we won t hurt each other any more you won t try to play a managerial r le any more and you won t set the shipping clerks against me they laughed but now you go to sleep if you don t sleep you ll be sick again for the day i ll be back in about two hours covering her he kissed her eyes and went vasya felt happy light of heart she fell asleep as if all her joy had come back to her as if she had lost nothing vladimir didn t come back from the station but telephoned that he would have to go to the office he would be back for dinner vasya was feeling better but she didn t go to the hemp binding works instead she busied herself about the house helping marya semyonovna to straighten up the house not long before dinner the telephone rang vasya answered hello is vladimir ivanovitch at home no not yet who s speaking the administrative office but why do you call here he s still in your office no he s not here he left the office some time ago please forgive me that woman s voice again who was it vasya didn t like that voice during the first few days of her stay it had called often then it had stopped vasya once asked ivan ivanovitch quite casually who it might be that was forever telephoning from the office and during working hours at that ivan ivanovitch explained that it was the clerks queer that their voices should be so much alike and again vasya felt the serpent s fangs vladimir brought home two members of the administration for dinner they discussed the morning s consignments nevertheless he found time to ask how vasya was feeling whether she had been sunning herself as the doctor had ordered no i didn t lie in the sun dryly vasya brought the conversation to a close adding carelessly the young lady who s forever phoning you from the office called again what young lady vladimir looked surprised from the office you say then it must be the shelgunov woman some young lady that one a venerable materfamilias you ve seen her vasya the fat woman with the wart on her face he spoke so simply so naturally but vasya felt uneasy no something was wrong there after dinner the gentlemen of the management went away vasya was glad she wanted to be alone with vladimir to warm her spirit the morning s promise of joy would be fulfilled but the guests had hardly left when the telephone buzzed in the study vladimir went to answer it yes it s i curtly didn t i ask you not to telephone a short laugh family matters of course reproachfully by no means i forbid it most decidedly vehemently all right all right relenting but not for long good bye vasya was in the next room listening with whom was he speaking whom did he promise but not for long to whom could he say i forbid it vladimir went from the study straight into the bedroom passing vasya as though he didn t see her she followed him he was standing before the mirror combing his hair to whom were you speaking volodya to savelyev to savelyev has he come back this morning did you meet him look here what sort of cross examination is this you know i was supervising the unloading of a shipment this morning he seemed disturbed and you re going to him right away did you promise yes i m going there silence vasya felt her heart hammering pounding as if it would burst if only it would she could endure this agony no longer she went quickly over to vladimir gently took his hand don t do that volodya don t start that business again what do you mean he asked suspiciously uneasily don t have anything to do with that crooked speculator i ve been warned after all that s the principal thing they have against you your association with objectionable people ah there you go again talking like one of your supervisory committee do you insist on tormenting me tyrannizing me do you want to tie me to your apron strings flushed he pushed vasya s hand away stop vladimir stop what did you say did i ever attempt to chain you to me try to keep your head i m talking about you not myself don t dig a pit for yourself you have enemies enough and if you resume your friendship with savelyev what has savelyev to do with this what do you mean what has he to do with this aren t you going to him vasya s eyes were troubled of course i m going to him but what of it can t you understand that i m going to him on business it can t be helped i don t believe you she cried hotly postpone it for tomorrow tell him to come to the office what a child you are vasya he said altering his tone all right i ll tell you the truth it s true that savelyev didn t call me over to discuss business that can be attended to in the office he s simply having a jolly little crowd at his house and he asked me to come over for a game of cards you know yourself vasya that i went nowhere for almost a month i was at home and taken up with business all the time let me get a breath of air for a change vasya i m young i want to live i can t be a hermit i understand volodya she said sadly yes everything s as you say and your getting a little diversion is no calamity but you must understand one thing you mustn t start up again with this savelyev this speculating scoundrel you have no respect for him yourself what do you need him for people will be saying right away that vladimir ivanovitch and savelyev are hand and glove again and then the whole business ll start all over again volodya darling please don t go there today cancel it what nonsense volodya was losing his patience if the provincial committee has nothing to do but take legal action against a fellow because of his acquaintances then it s no provincial committee but a cesspool you re exaggerating vasya but i don t like to see you go there i know he can t stand me he asks you over only to hurt me didn t i hear you say over the phone that you couldn t come on account of your family and then you laughed volodya she was becoming agitated it hurts me to see you laughing with a stranger about me and with savelyev at that as if i didn t let you go well you don t so that s how you put it very well then go but remember her eyes flashed remember that my patience is at an end i ve helped you suffered for you stood up for you that s enough go if you want to but then i ll know what i have to do her voice rose to a shrill hysterical shriek i m sick of your hysterics why do you nag me what do you want of me volodya there were tears in vasya s voice i ve never asked you for anything but today i beg you to stay for your sake and mine oh you women you re all the same disgusting rushing past her he hurried through the hall the front door banged the motor purred i ve come to you lisa take me in i ve gone away from him forever her voice failed her but her eyes were dry her misery was too great for tears you ve come away from him you should have done it long ago we ve all been wondering that you ve stood it so long we ve become estranged lisa that s the terrible thing wailed vasya of course how in the world can you love him vasya ignored the question she could hardly believe what had happened she could never forgive never forget this indignity it had been the first time she had begged him for something and what had he done he might just as well have walked over her dead body and why why to play cards with that thief that speculator savelyev and a crowd of his filthy fellows it was all the same to him that vasya was dying of grief as long as he was having a good time as long as he was getting the entertainment he wanted was that love was that her friend and comrade was that a communist lisa was unable to make head or tail out of vasya s incoherent speech what had happened what did savelyev have to do with it what does he have to do with it why it was all on his account on account of that crooked speculator vladimir went to him you think he went to him why to whom do you think don t you believe it but what is there to believe the whole town knows it only you seem to be blind or do you refuse to see it do you refuse to realize it see what lisa tell me why that your vladimir has a friend a friend vasya did not understand at once but stared at lisa she was neither shocked nor grieved but only surprised a friend you say who is it not one of us not a working girl one of the office employees do you know her i ve seen her the whole town knows her why she s always so dressed up that s why the comrades are so angry at your vladimir michailo pavlovitch told you of this friendship too how could you help knowing about it you re not so stupid otherwise but in this affair you ve acted like a real goose vasya however was concerned with something quite different does he love her how should i know he must love her he s been running around with her for so many months people thought the affair would stop when you came but nothing of the sort he s forever going to her in his car does she have a home of her own the chances are it s more elaborate than yours so that s what it was he s keeping up two households now vasya understood everything everything but one point why had volodya lied to her tormented her deceived her what do you expect was he to come to you as the contrite sinner or was he to beg you for permission to visit his friend it was your business to see it if you didn t you were a fool and have only yourself to blame why do you insist on talking about my being a fool lisa that s not important the question is this does he really love her or does it only look like it how do you mean i don t know what you re talking about he must love her doesn t he support her entirely and give her expensive presents do you think so but you see i don t know you surely don t believe that he loves you don t fool yourself vasya it ll only hurt you all the more he likes and esteems you of course you re his wife and comrade but as for loving you that was over long ago i know vasya shook her head but you see i don t agree with you her stupidity annoyed lisa who now told her about volodya s friend beautiful as a picture and her clothes always dressed in silks and always surrounded by admirers savelyev was one of them knew her well it was very gay there in the evening and there were rumors that both vladimir and savelyev were keeping her for some reason or other this idea was particularly distasteful to vasya had vladimir actually changed so could he really love a woman like that vasya didn t believe the stories she heard she didn t believe them something was wrong there lisa however was offended all right don t believe me it s your own affair ask anybody everyone ll tell you the same thing she was in the office as savelyev s secretary until she let the manager keep her but it s possible that others are making use of her too they re talking about ivan ivanovitch too and some members of the administration visit there occasionally she s a real one only not registered her luck that they don t have to have permits nowadays but vladimir would never have fallen in love with a woman like that objected vasya why do you think that men like that kind especially men like your vladimir you can see it in his face the worse the woman the better he ll like her be still lisa how dare you you don t know him how can you judge him like this why do you stand up for him didn t he make you the laughing stock of the town but you you defend him like a fortress made me a laughing stock and how if you please what have vladimir s actions to do with me i m not responsible for him you don t understand lisa that isn t why i m suffering that s not it at all i know you re suffering because he doesn t love you any more no lisa that s not it either it hurts of course but it s not the most important thing i know what i mean but i can t find the words what is it we were such comrades so close and intimate and suddenly you say vladimir turned away from me lied to me was afraid of me of me how could he would i have stood in his way would i have kept him from his love he couldn t volodya couldn t think that there must be something else he can t love that girl so much now you re beating about the bush said lisa waving her away angrily it s impossible to talk to you you re still in love with volodya strike me wipe your feet on me it s all the same to me i m still your obedient wife i ll lick your boots i m not like that i d have got even with him long ago i d have given him something to think about vasya didn t deny it but the more lisa condemned vladimir the more ardently vasya defended him she wanted to convince lisa that he was wrong not in taking a friend not in loving another woman but only in his not having told her vasya about it as if she weren t his friend and comrade but a stranger what was more she meant less to him than a stranger for he had no faith in her did he think that she would fight for her rights like a legitimate wife you must fight for them shouted lisa of course you must fight for them how dared he make you ridiculous then you surely must leave him vasya objected it was always like that in her heart she often condemned vladimir disagreed with him entirely but the moment some one else attacked him she took his side and grew indignant people didn t understand him she alone knew vladimir the american only when she said the american did the tears come she remembered vladimir the american leading the members of their group fighting for the soviet weeping she fell in lisa s arms she was not thinking of vladimir the manager but she was mourning for the american was suffering for him inconsolably mortally it s so hard for me lisenyka i m exhausted i know darling only be patient it ll pass i went through the same thing last year but when we meet nowadays it doesn t bother me at all vasya was unable to sleep although lisa had given her her own bed sleeping on a couple of chairs herself lisa had worked all day now she was sleeping soundly vasya turned restlessly from side to side now sitting up now lying down again she couldn t rest countless thoughts raced through her head tortured and broke her heart it was like that dreadful night when she had found the bandage when vladimir had been arrested it wasn t jealousy that was tormenting her but volodya s lack of confidence hurt her if not for that she would forgive everything man can not control his heart but vasya did not believe that he loved the other girl she did not believe it it was only a liaison for months he had lived alone he of the ardent temperament she remembered styosha he had begun an affair with her and it went on she probably wouldn t let him go lisa too said he was a ladies man and if it was that it couldn t be a case of love therefore she was looking out for her own advantage volodya would have liked to tear himself away but he could not vasya remembered how moody how variable he had been now loving now distant he had suffered agonies how could one live with the person one loved while the other was sharpening the knife behind his back she remembered how frequently vladimir had tried to confess something how he had always stopped short he had been about to say something on the morning of the clash with the shipping clerks vasya had felt he had it on the tip of his tongue she too had been frightened and unfortunately had begun to cough then vladimir said nothing more did he therefore pity her and if he pitied her he loved her but did he love her it was easy to say he did but what about the blue material the same for both of them i have bought you a present my beautiful sweetheart and i haven t forgotten that wearisome wife of mine here take the silk and say nothing damn him vasya clenched her fists as though she wanted to fight with vladimir she thought so he didn t go to savelyev yesterday and savelyev had nothing to do with it he had been only a screen had she known that he had a friend who pretended to love him she would not have been angry with vladimir she would have been unhappy still she would have understood but to humiliate vasya for that vulgar speculator savelyev she would have understood the affair with his friend yet would she have forgiven as she had forgiven him for the nurse for styosha would she have been able to like the white poodle to forget the blue silk chapter x lisa had hardly left for work in the morning when the door opened and marya semyonovna appeared a black lace shawl wrapped about her head she was gasping for breath it was hot midsummer good morning vassilissa dementyevna i m bringing you a letter from your husband he wanted me to take a cab to get here faster but where can one be found nowadays i m all out of breath as vasya tore open the envelope bearing the address of the office her fingers seemed petrified vasya what does this mean what are you doing to me why do you torture me so unmercifully do you want a scandal throughout the district to give my enemies new material to ruin me you ve often said you were my friend but you ve joined my foes you ve destroyed my soul i can t go on with this life if you no longer love me say so openly why do you stab me from behind you know i love only you everything else everyone says about me is nonsense ephemeral listen to me i swear to you that i was not with savelyev yesterday i swear to you that i kept faith with you where i was yesterday my heart beats for you only i m all worn out vasya have pity come to me let me look into your dear eyes and tell you everything the whole truth if you re my friend and comrade you ll come if not then good bye but this you must know that i won t live without you your wretched volodya vasya read the letter twice now her heart was filled with tenderness and the tears welled up in her eyes ephemeral i love only you then again she raged she had tortured him he asked her to pity him had he had pity with her had he not tormented her her eyes were dry her pale lips pressed together in a thin line wretched you don t say wretched all night long he had made love to another woman he had given her blue silk how she had begged him yesterday stay she had put all her soul into her eyes but he had pushed her away had shouted at her like a real lawful husband and had gone now he wrote i love only you he was lying he did not love her a fine sort of love that only pain and bitterness yet why had he written good bye but this you must know that i won t live without you surely he wouldn t nonsense it was merely a threat to make her relent to make her come to him at once like a fool she read the letter once more in the meanwhile marya semyonovna sat there quite unconcerned wiping off her perspiration fanning herself with her handkerchief vladimir ivanovitch came home yesterday almost as soon as you had gone he asked where you were he went into the study and began to write about midnight he came into the kitchen to ask whether you had come back no i said and he went away then he took ivan ivanovitch to the door and went into the bedroom he must have seen your note there i heard him crying like a heart broken little child and he didn t lie down all night but walked around all the time this morning he didn t even drink tea i don t want anything he said to me go and look for vassilissa dementyevna go to all her friends till you find her don t you dare come back without her vasya listened aching with the old love for vladimir he had waited for her alone through the night had wept and suffered had called her vasya and how hard it had been for her how she had yearned for him she had been jealous so the threads that had bound their hearts together were not broken their love was not gone entirely why prolong the agony should she go back back to him for a good talk what was vladimir ivanovitch doing when you left was he going to the office when i left why he was just telephoning to the little lady probably wanted to tell her his troubles or maybe he wanted her to share in his joy who can understand these men if only there ll be no scandal he had called up the little lady now at such a time he had written a letter to vasya and then telephoned to his lady lisa might be right he was clinging to vasya only to avoid a scandal if his wife had not been held in such high esteem he would not have bothered about her and he was calling her only to humiliate her again no she had had enough she would not go to him would not fall into the trap her head was reeling tell vladimir ivanovitch that there s no answer that s all and hurry please go i can t go any faster and it doesn t pay to hurry in such things you should have thought of this before vassilissa dementyevna of course vladimir ivanovitch did wrong by you for you re his wife but you aren t altogether in the right either who would leave such a young man all alone for months and if you think about it vladimir ivanovitch is a good husband after all always worrying about you always wanting to know whether you re drinking your cocoa whether i ve fetched fresh eggs for you he cares more for your clothes than you do he s never refused you anything and where women are concerned who is blameless there you re his wife people respect you but on the other side he pays her and gives her presents that s all as marya semyonovna spoke vasya s heart was growing heavier how simple everything would be if she too could think that but marya semyonovna did not understand just what had hurt her vladimir was no longer her friend she had lost faith in him and how could they live together without faith don t you think you ought to wait till evening vassilissa dementyevna couldn t i go home and tell your husband that you want to think things over and will give your answer in the evening that d be more sensible but to talk this way deciding on the spur of the moment it s easy to make a mistake when you re angry i want to save you regrets and tears no marya semyonovna don t try to persuade me it ll be as i ve said i m never coming back it s all over her lips trembled as she spoke and big tears rolled slowly down her hollow cheeks well it s your own business i ve said enough you have to do the deciding and marya semyonovna went again vasya wanted to moan like a wounded animal to sob loudly so that she could be heard throughout the house and on the street for it was all over there was no going back farewell volodya farewell vasya wept inconsolably until finally she fell asleep buried in lisa s pillow for she had not closed her eyes all night she was awakened by the sound of an auto chugging away under her window whose car she jumped to her feet was vladimir coming for her hope and joy awoke in her heart she pushed the window open vasya the boy was standing at the door vassilissa dementyevna something terrible has happened vladimir ivanovitch has taken poison how what vasya flew over to the boy seized his hand is he dead no not yet he s still alive but he s writhing he s in agony he s calling for you ivan ivanovitch sent me in the car hatless barely dressed vasya entered the auto her teeth were chattering she was trembling as from a fever she had killed him had hurt him mortally she had refused her pity and her help and he had begged for her in the morning how he had begged for her she stared before her with wide open eyes they expressed not sorrow but death the inevitable vasya didn t see her eyes he was telling with an important air just what had occurred he liked the idea of such interesting things happening vladimir ivanovitch had gone to the office in the morning then after half an hour he had come home he had gone into the study and vasya had seen him going to the closet where he kept samples of dyes that were being tested for their stability then vasya was busy sweeping in the courtyard when he had finished and returned to the house he heard someone groaning in the study he went in to see what was wrong there was vladimir ivanovitch lying on the sofa only the whites of his eyes showing his mouth open and foaming and then the fun began vasya had run for the doctor who lived around the corner he was just eating but vasya told him how matters stood the man s dying you can eat later vasya had to make two hurried trips to the druggist in the car ivan ivanovitch came over the whole house was turned upside down vasya listened without hearing a word she herself was more dead than alive nothing remained but vladimir and his sufferings they filled her mind completely if volodya should die her life would be at an end too there would be only emptiness an emptiness more dreadful than the grave she entered the house with the boy ivan ivanovitch was just taking the doctor to the door is he alive we re doing everything possible we won t be able to know anything definite before the morning she tiptoed into the bedroom vladimir s groans became more and more distinct she seemed to be moaning herself could vladimir be detached from her from vasya the bedroom was changed different the rug was rolled up the bed had been moved but the bed was empty where was volodya something big white long lay on the divan its face was a bluish gray its eyes were closed the moaning stopped what was that was he dead volodya volodya the physician turned on her furiously silence no hysterics assisted by a white capped nurse the doctor was busy with vladimir both looked grave and severe they did not let vasya come near vladimir he opened his eyes and breathed more rapidly he was alive doctor vasya whispered pleadingly tell me the truth is there any hope there s always hope as long as the heart is beating the doctor answered angrily as if she were asking silly questions what did that mean as long as the heart is beating and suppose it should stop but she asked nothing more the doctor was busy he and the nurse were raising vladimir s head pouring something into his mouth once more vladimir began to moan short plaintive cries vasya listened she no longer felt anything but was absolutely numb as if grief had paralyzed her senses as if her being had stopped twilight and darkness the night lamp burning in the bedroom other physicians came consulted the errand boy was rushed to the health bureau for special medicine vasya was not permitted to see vladimir nor did he ask for her he seemed unconscious occasionally uttered short sobbing moans she thought that as he moaned his spirit was leaving him that his soul was struggling against his body but the body refused to liberate the soul helplessly superfluous vasya walked among the physicians knowing of nothing she could do suddenly it struck her like a thunderbolt there must be rumors afloat in the city people would say a communist and a suicide why and the gossiping would begin she would have to hurry hurry to forestall gossip she would have to think of something what happened and why an inspiration mushrooms he had had mushrooms for breakfast and now he was near death she remembered such a case in her grandmother s village while she had visited there a tailor who had come from the city to visit his brother had gathered some mushrooms himself had cooked them eaten them and died vasya began to telephone michailo pavlovitch came first she would tell him the details when she saw him now she merely wanted to tell him of the tragedy briefly it was this vladimir ivanovitch had been poisoned by mushrooms and lay on the point of death then she telephoned the chairman and other comrades she had prompted ivan ivanovitch who was explaining matters to the members of the administration advising the office and very minutely she told vasya the errand boy and marya semyonovna what they would have to say vasya keen and quick witted curled his lip shrugged his shoulders and said nothing let it be so it was all the same to him marya semyonovna however was offended pressed her lips together and folded her hands over her apron she refused to agree to the mushroom story how can a man be poisoned so badly by mushrooms everybody ll say why wasn t the cook more careful but vasya insisted the story had been told to everybody he had eaten mushrooms and they had made him ill have it your own way but it wasn t a very clever idea if it had been something else but mushrooms who would cook bad mushrooms vasya left the kitchen marya semyonovna however couldn t regain her composure banged about furiously with the pots here they make a mess of things get everything all mixed up and now i m to blame first they make a bed the devil himself couldn t sleep in and now i have to lie in it if you please marya semyonovna is responsible i can t tell the difference between good and bad mushrooms how can they insult a person like that i ve been in the kitchen for twenty years there s no other cook like me i m as good as a chef you should see my pile of references even the late madame gollolobova the general s wife who always was so proud never called me anything but marya semyonovna and the pokatilovs the millionaires gave me a gold watch and chain for christmas because my sauces were so good and now just look at what they ve thought up marya semyonovna gave the manager poisonous mushrooms i didn t think such an outrage was possible didn t i do everything i could i felt sorry for this vassilissa never breathed a word to her about her husband s sweetheart but that s how people are nothing but injustice and they re communists why are you angry marya semyonovna why do you feel offended vasya spoke thoughtfully eating his soup the while with great relish does it make any difference what they tell us to say the truth will out you won t be held responsible they ve invented the story about the mushrooms only to keep down the scandal but i like it it s an interesting business there s passion for you what are the movies compared to this and you re having a good time you silly boy a person s dying and you think it s fun what has the world come to nobody cares about life the least little thing happens and bing bang they ve shot the fellow that s why people don t really want to live any more it s all because they ve forgotten god oh forget about god yourself i m not a communist but i don t believe in god either and it s wrong of you not to believe there he sits and chatters without doing any work why don t you help me clear away the plates these fellows these doctors use up so many dishes they re forever wanting tea and everything else god s will be done that s what i told that dressed up minx the maid of vladimir ivanovitch s sweetheart i was just finished with serving supper for the doctors when she comes running in by the back door rustling her skirts wearing a little batiste apron sporting a butterfly on her head and wagging her tail my lady sent me to find out how vladimir ivanovitch is getting on he s getting on so well i said that i guess he ll be standing before his god pretty soon for god punishes everyone for his sins but as for your mistress that hussy just tell her she d better go to church and do penance after all she s the only one who s to blame in vassilissa s presence marya semyonovna was very silent but the moment she found someone else to talk to there was no stopping the torrent of her words the house grew still people had come during the day members of the administration fellow workers the physicians had been consulting lisa shared the night watch with vasya so that she would not be alone as she suffered and waited for the end lisa felt that she too was partly responsible for she had aroused vasya against vladimir don t say that lisa i worked myself up against him it took mortal danger to make me realize that nothing in the world is dearer to me than he how can i live without him his blood will be on my head her curly head supported on her hand vasya sat beside vladimir s bed thinking suppose volodya should die so that she could no longer live with him what then the revolution the party the party could use only those who had no crime on their conscience but vasya would never be able to forget that she had killed vladimir if there had been some good reason but because of a woman s jealousy if he had had crooked dealings with thieves like savelyev if he had acted against the interests of the people there would have been a reason but to make her friend die because of a woman and such a friend she had thought he did not love her but he must have loved her since he had gone to his death so life without her meant nothing to him in spite of her sorrow this realization moved her to tears to sweet penitent tears gazing at her beloved man vasya whispered tenderly will you forgive me my darling will you be able to forget my dear friend he stirred moved his head restlessly water water gently vasya raised his head from the pillow as the nurse had shown her and gave him water vladimir drank his eyes opened and looked at her but seemed not to see her do you feel better volodetchka she bent over him anxiously he didn t answer he opened his eyes and closed them again is ivan ivanovitch here he asked feebly no he s gone do you want him he nodded call him phone him but the doctor forbade you to bother about business vladimir looked impatient and fretful please don t torment me now at least get him his eyes closed vasya felt a dagger why had he said that please don t torment me now at least so he had not forgiven her for causing him this mortal agony she summoned ivan ivanovitch when he came vladimir asked vasya to leave him alone with ivan ivanovitch she went into the garden the red roses had withered away but the dahlias were in full bloom the sun was blazing down on her hands her shoulders her head it no longer caressed her as in the spring but burned painfully the garden was neglected the honeysuckle vines entwined the lilac bushes like ivy the sky was not blue the heat made it look like molten silver vasya walked over the baking ground no vladimir wouldn t forgive her he would not forget if she had come when he called her that morning nothing would have happened now she had lost him lost him forever not her adored lover but her friend her comrade volodya would not trust her any more would not lean on her again vasya was standing beside the acacia tree that had been so full of white blossoms in the spring she closed her eyes why hadn t she poisoned herself why did she still live vassilissa dementyevna vladimir ivanovitch wants you ivan ivanovitch called to her as he entered the car and went away where was he going was he taking a message to vladimir s friend but vasya no longer cared the past would never return it was hot the scorching sun of summer was exhausting the shades had been lowered vladimir was sleeping vasya knelt at the foot of his bed driving away the flies he had to sleep to regain his strength he had suffered enough vasya and volodya were alone in the house marya semyonovna had gone shopping vasya the boy had been sent away vasya liked being alone with volodya she felt as if he belonged to her as if he were her property he was so weak and helpless if only he could understand if only he could read her heart he would see how ardently she loved him how she was suffering how she longed for his caresses how her loneliness starved her why was volodya always so taciturn so hostile toward her he never looked into her eyes when she did not arrange the pillows quite properly he would say irritably and that calls itself a nurse she doesn t even know how to fix the pillows of course one can t expect much from a sick man still why was he like that could he really not forgive her never and if they stayed together would it always be as now lonely dismal bleak she looked at vladimir at the dear familiar face with its long eye lashes vasya had fallen in love with them at the very beginning and he had been captivated by her hair but her hair was gone it was like the old fairy tale her hair had bewitched him when it was cut off her lover left her how they had loved each other then in and later when the white offensive began the night when together they arrested the conspirators if i fall vasya don t lose a single hour of your work your tears can wait till later and the same goes for you volodya we promise each other they had held each other s hands had looked into each other s eyes and had gone to their work without delay it had been cold then the stars had been shining the snow had creaked under their feet as vasya and vladimir had gone with their men at the memory vasya s heart grew tender as if the warmth radiating from her lost happiness were melting it vasya had not wept when the disaster had come upon her she had not lamented had forgotten herself but now the tears were running down her cheeks not bitter scalding tears but gently sorrowful ones she was weeping for the happiness of long ago vasya why vasya what is it volodya had raised his head from the pillows and was looking at her his eyes were distant no longer no longer seemed to look past her they weren t cold they were his eyes volodya s loving sympathetic eyes although their expression still was sad what is it vasyuk why are you crying poor child he laid his hand on her curls lovingly volodya my darling will you forgive me will you forgive silly vasya what do you want me to forgive now stop crying so we can talk sit down here closer to me here we live our lives side by side saying nothing and suffering so but you must not get excited now i m afraid for you dear some other time no it wouldn t go so well some other time let me talk vasya i m so wretched that s why i wanted to die and even now though i want to live i see no way out we ll look for it together volodya after all i m not a stranger to you are you sure you know everything vasya she nodded i know now you understand what was hurting me and you were always reproaching me with silly things forever harping on savelyev i know volodya and you made another mistake did you think that was love did you no vasya i love only you you my guardian angel you my faithful friend but there vasya it s different entirely different call it whatever you want call it lack of self control whatever you want only not love but you were jealous of me you suspected me spied on me never volodya never how can you say that think of the blue silk think of your cross examinations why do you smell of perfume and where does savelyev live show me i didn t spy on you volodya no i didn t but i was imagining all sorts of dreadful things i wanted to drive away those fancies volodya i wanted to believe in you to keep my faith in you oh don t talk about your fancies you were jealous all the same you didn t say so openly but you tormented me tortured me why go over all that we re both to blame silence both were thinking is our life to go on like this volodya vasya asked mournfully i don t know vasya i m lost myself i don t know what to do again both were silent both had much to say but they could not reach each other might you not really be happier with the other girl volodya vasya asked cautiously she was surprised that the question did not hurt her vasya vasya i see that you don t trust me can t you see whom i love didn t i try to kill myself because i had lost you there was reproach in both his voice and his eyes her heart was trembling with joy volodya they embraced their lips sought each other no not like that vasya calm down vasyuk my strength hasn t come back yet you see i can t even kiss you smiling vladimir patted vasya s head but his eyes were sad again no the wall between them could not be broken down they could not find the path that led through the thorny hedge of misunderstanding from one heart to the other chapter xi vladimir had returned to his work for the first time had gone to the office vasya was rejoicing in her freedom in the morning she rushed to the party committee and thence to the hemp binding works lisa was asking for help preparations had to be made for the meeting of the union on the way to the party committee vasya smiled she felt as though she had escaped from a cage everything delighted her she felt as if she had not seen her comrades for an incredibly long time and they were glad too they had missed her vasya was a general favorite she did so much gossiped not at all and sympathized with everybody s troubles the moment she reached party headquarters she was given work to do she had to determine what was to be discussed at the meeting and to classify the material with the speakers vasya looked at the clock impossible it was almost eight vladimir must have waited for her impatiently had they given him a dinner conforming with the doctor s orders vasya had forgotten all about it she walked with lisa discussing the news that a comrade of the central administration had brought from moscow many peculiar things were happening in the party these days lisa was in complete disagreement with the new policy she stood with the boys of the factory they were going to put up their own candidates at the party conference there would be another fight against the chairman vasya envied her since her arrival she had taken no really active part in anything as if she were not a member of the party but only a sympathizer that s because you re a manager s wife if you had been living by yourself you would have come back to work very soon vasya sighed lisa didn t have to tell her that she knew it herself but she had no time to think of such things as soon as vladimir should have completely recovered she would go back to her province oh you won t go you re much too fond of your vladimir ivanovitch you re only a wife nowadays lisa objected irritably vasya remained silent what could she say lisa was right but she did not complain she had gone through too much let volodya only live live without suffering when vasya came home he was not there where is vladimir ivanovitch hasn t he come back yet of course he came back he was here from three o clock and waited for you to come for dinner but he couldn t wait so long when you didn t come he ate with ivan ivanovitch they went away not long ago marya semyonovna told her but there s a note for you on the table vasya took it up dear vasya we ve agreed always to be frank with each other and you said you d always understand me i absolutely must be there today i ll tell you why later then you ll understand that i couldn t help it i beg you to stand by our agreement and not to grieve your volodya when vasya had read the note her hands dropped on her lap again so it was not over but why had she thought it was over had volodya ever said so hadn t she known that ivan ivanovitch was always going back and forth forming the connecting link between vladimir and the other woman volodya was honest as she had begged him to be frankness only frankness why did it hurt so why did bitter resentment and indignation rise in her heart as if volodya had deceived her again marya semyonovna was setting the table and looking disapprovingly at vasya do you want to eat she asked are you starting this business all over again nobody eats and a person is expected to cook then there ll be more of your endless quarrels and tears you may resent it or not vassilissa dementyevna but i must tell you the truth you re not the woman for vladimir ivanovitch now you re broken hearted over his letter and you re crying because he s gone to his mistress but i tell you that you re to blame too the man just rose up from the dead so to speak he took poison on account of you but the moment he walked out the door you were gone yourself if it were your work it would be different business demands its rights but you just run around from one meeting to another enlightening our silly women why don t you clean up your own house before you try to teach others it s a disgrace to work for you banging the door she disappeared into the kitchen but after a few minutes marya semyonovna returned a little gentler with a hot omelet and a cup of cocoa eat vassilissa dementyevna and stop thinking you can t think of everything after all marya semyonovna sat down at the table beside vasya and recounted her own experiences something of the sort had happened in the house of the late madame gollolobova the general s wife all on account of the french governess but then the general and his wife were reconciled and lived together very well until she died what was more they even were happy vasya listened half heartedly but did not interrupt she had come to know marya semyonovna during vladimir s illness marya semyonovna pitied vasya and recognized one of her own people in her she hated the specialists the doctors and the managers thought them all burshuis but now vasya had to listen to marya semyonovna s endless stories of how the millionaire pokatilovs had lived and what the general s wife used to like for dinner they bored vasya but she didn t want to hurt marya semyonovna s feelings she was a kindly old soul though she seemed rather sulky at first glance her stories were particularly disagreeable to vasya just now she wanted to weigh everything to clear up matters in her own mind to think things over from beginning to end thanks for the supper marya semyonovna now i ll have to go to my papers is that all you ate if i d known that i wouldn t have cooked anything for you you ll kill yourself vassilissa dementyevna and the whole business isn t worth that for to tell you the truth i wouldn t give a kopek for vladimir ivanovitch s sweetheart she isn t worth your little finger lisa had said the same thing why do you say that marya semyonovna she is supposed to be so very beautiful what s beautiful in her she s painted and powdered like a clown she isn t interested in anything but clothes so that she can get more and more out of the men do you know her did you ever see her of course i know her how often didn t she sleep here before you came the dressed up hussy she has all sorts of notions she has to have hot water at night needs this that and the other she pretends she s a lady and says she s been used to this life since she was a child but she s lying she doesn t look like that real gentlefolk are more polite they always say please and thank you to the servants but this hussy can only give orders bring me this do that clear these things away what s her name her name nina constantinovna i can t remember her last name everybody in town calls her just nina constantinovna i d like to see her sometime vasya said thoughtfully turning volodya s note in her hands nothing could be simpler she goes walking in the city park every day when the band plays let s go there tomorrow and you can take a look at the minx in the old days that kind used to walk the streets of moscow at night when the music plays you say all right marya semyonovna let s go there maybe i ll feel better after i ve seen her marya semyonovna shook her head doubtfully but she made no attempt to dissuade vasya she was anxious to see how the two rivals would look at each other vasya went through the dark house she didn t want any light she felt that the darkness soothed her she could not sleep in the morning everything seemed fine volodya was well and working again and she too was busy for she would soon return to her province she didn t want to be the manager s lady since she and vladimir had agreed always to be frank she felt better but the pain was still there it was not jealousy nor had vladimir broken his word he had told the truth to vasya as to a friend still she did not feel quite happy she scolded herself what in the world did she want surely she had not thought that vladimir had come back to her altogether that he had torn the other out of his heart but that was just it that was what vasya had thought hoped for longed for and what was the upshot of it all they had suffered so much and had progressed not an inch vladimir was again spending his evenings with the other woman while vasya wandered alone through the dark house he had no pity for her whom did he love her vasya his friend and comrade or the other he said he loved vasya but it wasn t true these thoughts only increased her suffering if she knew that he had stopped loving her she would go away but as matters stood how could she go suppose she was mistaken suppose he should attempt suicide again vasya could not leave vladimir how could she live far away from him with this agony in her heart it was more bearable when he was there come what might she loved vladimir if she didn t love him could she suffer such torment because of him she loved him but she understood him less every day as if they had entered a forest by two divergent paths the farther they penetrated into the forest the greater the distance between them she loved volodya but in her heart she condemned him more and more why had he had anything to do with such a creature if it had been one of her own people a communist girl she would not have felt so hurt but this was a real burshuika volodya himself had told vasya that she was a stranger a young lady of the aristocracy spoiled she could not understand the bolsheviki and the communists but longed for her old life she had been brought up in luxury there had been seventeen servants in her home she had had a horse of her own accustomed to the side saddle her father had been a white soldier her mother had died during the revolution her brother an officer had been reported missing only she was left she had looked for work as she knew many languages she was taken on in the administrative offices as a secretary volodya met her there she fell in love with him wrote him letters vasya was far away volodya was always alone so their affair began it was soon noticed in the office nina constantinovna was frowned upon and had to give up her position savelyev made her his secretary only his secretary vasya couldn t hold back the question for one thing she wanted to irritate vladimir besides she wanted to learn the truth about the other what sort of gossip are your repeating there vladimir flared up aren t you ashamed to say such vile things i didn t think you would sling mud at her like any other woman why vasya it doesn t become you he told vasya that savelyev was a sort of father or guardian to nina constantinovna he had known her parents and when nina stood alone in the world he took care of her gave her advice and material assistance procured the position in the administrative office for her then when she left he helped her again she had to vacate her room where could she go to vladimir that couldn t be done savelyev offered to take her into his house but nina constantinovna didn t want that was she to be left on the street savelyev found a small house where he arranged to have his office and offered nina a home there for he is something like a guardian of hers he feels sorry for her takes care of her and makes love to her again vasya could not control herself she was angry volodya spoke too favorably of her he always had been a trusting soul vasya however was suspicious of the girl everybody said she was a regular one it s a lie a slanderous lie why do you find pleasure in repeating such filth if you want to know the truth ask me nina thinks of no one nina loves only me and even if it were true savelyev would not be the only one to make love to her do you know maklezov of the foreign trade office he offered her a life of luxury but nina showed him the door i won t deny that savelyev may like nina maybe his love for her isn t purely paternal but nina can t stand him as a man that is there s nothing doing there it s not to be thought of i know nina you can be sure of that she saw that he was growing quite excited as if he wanted to convince not vasya but himself but what hurt her most was savelyev s connection with everything she had disliked him from the first day there had been a reason for the s c telling her that vladimir ivanovitch ought to keep away from him but i don t see why savelyev has to be mixed up with it that s why they say that you keep her together share and share alike if anyone dares say that to you spit in his face you must understand me vasya that s the terrible part of it that nina was a virgin when i took her she was pure pure vasya felt a stab in her heart as if a fine needle were piercing it long ago in at that evening tea in vasya s room he had said i m keeping my heart for a pure girl and then that first night he had caressed her and said no one in the world can be purer than you pure what nonsense are you talking there vladimir what has the body to do with purity you re beginning to think like a burshui try to understand me vasya i don t think so but she does it s a great tragedy for her that i took her without marrying her now she thinks she s lost you can t know what she suffers she cries all the time try to understand vasya she thinks differently than we proletarians do the first man who has her has to marry her too why didn t you tell me that before who s preventing you from marrying her i oh vasya vasya you re so clever but when it comes to love you re a woman like all the rest how can i marry her vasya we re strangers we re different in every respect it s not love it s rather pity you can see it yourself only pity really she wanted to believe it was only pity if you don t love or understand each other why don t you separate it s tormenting both of you vasya didn t mention herself how can i leave her it s not such a simple matter vasya where can she go if i leave her on the street should savelyev keep her or should she register as a prostitute why all this fuss let her look for work work that s more easily said than done nowadays when everybody s laying off besides what sort of work after all nina can t go into a factory vasya wanted to say why not into a factory why not that hussy but she wanted to spare vladimir he was not yet well and the doctor had ordered him to avoid all excitement he was already visibly affected by their conversation later as she roamed through the dark house vasya was sorry why hadn t she cried out the truth why hadn t she told vladimir everything she thought of the woman she didn t believe that nina constantinovna loved him she was merely ensnaring him to gain a double advantage vasya hated her not because she was reputed to be of loose character but because her heart was not pure plenty of prostitutes were better than the so called decent women vasya remembered the curly haired sinka who had been shot by the whites and who cried as she died long live the soviet government long live the revolution she had been on the streets the lowest of the low but when the revolution broke out she revealed herself undertook the most difficult and most dangerous tasks she had worked in the cheka with all her heart and soul vasya could have understood vladimir s falling in love with a woman like that but this lady this burshuika she was a stranger after all and she had no heart she was simply fooling vladimir he trusting soul believed in her that was what hurt so badly vasya would never be able to reconcile herself to that what was her hold on him his pity for her i m so weak so helpless he said she had been pure pure but now there remained not the tiniest trace of that purity she had exchanged it long ago for presents from men he however still believed in her vasya was furious at the other woman how long are you going to run around the house this way vassilissa dementyevna grumbled marya semyonovna breaking vasya s train of thought you ought to take care of yourself you need your strength for your meetings why don t you try to sleep there s no sense in your staying up for your husband you won t want to have him in your room anyway when he comes from the other one i ll make his bed in the drawing room vasya threw her arms about marya semyonovna but she felt even more sad a stranger was sorry for her but he her lover her husband her friend pitied only the other the heartless wily woman who wound herself about him like a serpent are you asleep vasyuk coming into the bedroom vladimir lit the lamp vasya lay in bed her eyes wide open how could she sleep with this agony in her heart no i m not asleep is vasyuk angry with me he sat down on the bed and tried to kiss vasya she pushed him away vehemently so you are angry with me what about our agreement i told you the truth as i would a friend you asked me to yourself and now is it better to lie vasya did not answer it s not good for us darling to begin our squabbles and reproaches all over again why are you angry because i visited nina just think it over vasya i was together with you all the time and she is alone do you think she didn t worry and suffer enough when i was ill vasya wanted to scream what has that to do with me but she pressed her lips together she said nothing only her heart was beating furiously you must not think that anything happened vasyuk i wasn t alone with her savelyev was there too and ivan ivanovitch came in we had something to discuss would you like to know why i was there today well vasya i went there to say good bye why do you stare so don t you believe me ask ivan ivanovitch that s why i had him come here so that he would arrange everything help nina constantinova to get away from here pay her rent and all the rest of it where is she going vasya s voice sounded hollow to moscow savelyev will take her there he has relatives there with whom nina will live and she will look for a position it ll be easier for all of us that way vasya remained silent there was suspicion in her eyes why the sudden change what had happened didn t he love her any more let s not talk about love that s quite another question but nina too understands that things can t go on this way she s fully made up her mind to go to moscow she decided that long ago she told me she would go the morning you went away from me she telephoned me and said she would not go on with this life either the one thing or the other or she would go to moscow ah so that s it that s why you took poison one woman had gone and the other was threatening to leave if you didn t marry her now i see it all you were afraid you d lose her what a fool i am what a silly fool i thought it was because of me that you were despondent and wanted to die vasya laughed bitterly hysterically how you twist everything vasya how spiteful you ve become you re not the vasyuk you used to be vladimir said sadly getting up from the bed there s really no sense in our talking i wanted to tell you everything so there would be no secrets between us but now i see that the more truthful i am the worse matters become you ve become different cruel oh no stop volodya vasya s voice was like breaking glass quivered with all the despair of her heart if we re going to talk things over let s do it why do you send her to moscow you love her not me if you loved me you would have stayed with me today but you consider only her you pity only her vasya vasya how unjust you are if you only knew what nina has gone through in these months she is so young almost a child she hasn t a single close friend everybody slings mud at her and why vasya because she had the misfortune of falling in love with me you vasya have your party your friends but she has only me i m her only protector her only supporter walking up and down the room his hand on his back vladimir told vasya that nina had expected a child his child his dream so much joy and so much sorrow where is the child vasya asked trembling you surely don t think nina could have kept it the scandal and how you would have suffered we thought of you nina cried her heart out but for your sake vasya we decided to do even that for her sake he had discussed it with a strange woman had thought of her with a strange woman of her vasya as if she were not his friend and comrade but some enemy he had not come to her with his troubles but to the other to nina so she was nearer to him she not vasya belonged with him now the day you came i found out that nina was pregnant now you know what was tormenting me vasya she nodded silently vladimir went on telling her that nina had gone to another city to prevent gossip savelyev had found a place for her to live there and she had had her abortion there but the operation had not gone off smoothly there had been complications vladimir had gone to see her was that when the shipping clerks were going to strike yes about that time hm so that was why he had wept in the dining room that day on account of nina not because of the shipping clerks of course and she came back the morning savelyev arrived didn t she vasya went on yes i understand neither spoke both waited now the hard cruel words would come again later they would regret them but they could not be taken back they distorted love mutilating it until it was like a pock marked face no more beauty no more heart warming happiness vasya vladimir broke the oppressive silence why all this heartache who s to blame i swear to you i spared you spared you as long as i could that wasn t necessary volodya i only wanted you to believe that i m your friend sitting down again beside her vladimir took her hand yes vasya i know you re my friend that s why it s so hard for me he laid his head on vasya s shoulder as he had always used to do stroking that head vasya felt a sweet joy tempering her pain in spite of everything he was there with her he still loved her in his way mightn t it be better volodya if i go away and she stays she asked cautiously don t start with that again vasya don t torture me instead of helping me you drive me off the right path i ve revealed my soul to you as to a friend i m keeping no secrets from you and here you say you want to go away for your sake volodya if you love her what do you mean by love vasya love must be returned and i feel it so clearly that nina and i have nothing in common that she isn t a comrade that she can never be a friend like you to me i m sorry for her i take care of her what would become of her if i were to leave her if we were to part i feel responsible for her can t you understand after all she was a virgin when i took her that s nonsense volodya why are you responsible for her she wasn t a child she must have known what she was doing besides who bothers about such things nowadays you have proletarian ideas but nina is different it s a real tragedy for her i know that s why i say i ll go away and you should marry her there you go again vasya didn t i beg you not to torment me besides it s too late everything s been decided nina constantinovna goes to moscow thursday that s all there s to it let s stop talking about it vladimir spoke so calmly with so much assurance that she had to believe him but you be patient vasya for another few days don t do anything rash she ll go away and we ll live as before no it ll be better than ever before now we have suffered together and that ll bring us closer to each other volodya put his arms around vasya and kissed her eyes i d like to sleep with you tonight vasyuk do you mind i m so tired my head s reeling lying down he laid his head on vasya s shoulder and fell asleep at once vasya however did not sleep if he loved her he would have caressed her if he loved her he would have understood her grief she gazed at him that familiar head hiding such strange incomprehensible thoughts those long lashes veiling tender glances not meant for her those warm lips covering another woman with yearning kisses arousing her passion she pushed voldya s head from her shoulder he was a stranger to her why do you drive your precious volya away vladimir whispered in his sleep your precious volya whose pet name was that not vasya s he had confused them he thought of the other even in his sleep vasya scowled at her sleeping husband was that her lover had he once been her friend and comrade was he the man whom she had loved when together they had fought for the soviet he was a stranger a stranger she shivered she was so lonely chapter xii the park dusty withered by the oppressive heat of the summer the long and anxiously awaited rain did not come it would have washed the dust of the city from the trees would have quenched the thirst of the grass the band was playing before a small audience children were running about a few red guards were there sitting in groups or walking along with their sweethearts on a shady bench sat a priest in a monk s gown leaning on his staff lost in thought beside him was a nursemaid watching a little child vasya and marya semyonovna sat down on the bench although they were a trifle to one side they could see everything they waited for nina constantinovna why hasn t our little lady come yet generally she s here the moment the music begins to show off her clothes all the fine ladies come here to see what s stylish this year they find out from nina constantinovna because she s always dressed up to the minute vasya listened absent mindedly she was eager to see nina how would she be at the same time she was afraid how could she bear to look at her is that she marya semyonovna on that bench there to the right of the band the one in the pink dress how in the world could you think that nina constantinova isn t like that you ll see the difference between her and the others right away she s a real fashionable lady they sat there waiting but nina did not come only when they were about to go home intending to return the next day did she appear she was coming from the other end of the park and stopped before the band she was talking to savelyev and two members of the red committee and seemed unconscious of the eyes that stared at her so this was how she looked she was wearing a thin white dress that enveloped her body in soft folds and revealed the curve of her breasts she had on long sand colored gloves and a hat to match pulled down over her eyes vasya could not distinguish the features but saw only the lips shining red as blood what red red lips that s the rouge explained marya semyonovna you should see her eyes they look as if she d smeared soot over them somebody ought to take a sponge and wash the dirt off her face and then you ought to look at her i could be beautiful too if i used powder and rouge nina constantinovna was leaning on her white parasol tapping the ground with the point of her white shoes she laughed throwing back her head a little the members of the red committee laughed too apparently bored savelyev had stepped to one side and was tracing figures in the sand with his cane her hat hides her whole face vasya complained come let s walk past her then you can get a better look at the hussy but i advise you not to look her way she isn t pretty when i was working for madame gollolobova that s when i saw real fine ladies and real beauties compared to them she s nothing but vasya s curiosity bothered her she had to know why volodya loved the other girl just as vasya and marya semyonovna were getting up to walk past nina she said good bye to the members of the red committee exclaiming loudly enough for vasya to hear we ll meet again in moscow turning she went on toward the gate savelyev following you surely don t want to run after her you mustn t do that vassilissa dementyevna you ll have to let her go that bird people know you and that s no way of stopping gossip though she slackened her pace vasya kept her eyes fixed on the other she was tall slender her shoulders swayed a little as she walked her head was bowed as she went away from the bandstand vasya thought nina was crying savelyev bent toward her seemed to be trying to persuade her but nina shook her head no she said raising her tan gloved hand to her face as if to wipe away a tear could she weep had she come to bid the music farewell or or did she love volodya was she not merely trying to get something from him vasya was disturbed she felt no better now that she had seen nina constantinovna it was no longer jealousy that bothered her but another new feeling something like pity for nina why had she cried why had she come to hear the music to bid her happiness good bye a new load on vasya s heart she was furious at herself that was all that was needed to suffer with the other woman with the one who had got in her way a fine state of affairs nina had gone to moscow almost two weeks had passed since she and savelyev had left the city logically vasya should have enjoyed life now the interloper was gone vladimir had stayed behind with vasya so she surely was dearer more precious to him and the other affair was merely temporary vasya smiled vasya laughed she coughed less and visited the party committee regularly vladimir was working too he was reorganizing the business according to the plans of the syndicate people when that would be finished he and vasya would go to moscow whence he was to be transferred to his new district vladimir was happy entirely taken up with his work but the real heart felt joy of other days was lacking there was nothing to be done about it vladimir was not exactly cool but he had changed frequently he would be moody would lose his temper why did vasya come home so late from the party committee it was annoying for their guests for they would not have dinner without the hostess again he would flare up about the collars not a single one was clean then vasya too would be cross she wasn t responsible for that let him take care of it himself let him go to marya semyonovna vasya was no laundress both would be furious when they parted and why on account of a stupid collar one day vasya came home in the rain to save her hat she had left it at party headquarters and had put a shawl on her head when he saw her vladimir frowned and snarled how you dress your shoes are run down at the heels your skirt is filthy you come in with a shawl on your head like a peasant woman slovenly again she lost control of herself we can t all strut around like fashion plates but i don t have to accept any favors from savelyev vladimir looked daggers at her he said nothing vasya thought he would strike her but he restrained himself something was wrong here vasya and vladimir wanted to be friends but the slightest provocation filled them with hatred for each other vladimir was always dreaming of his new position how he could furnish the house how he could arrange everything this was boring for vasya why furnish a house what was the pleasure in that it would be different if it had anything to do with the common good vladimir disagreed with her reproached her with narrow mindedness vasya told of a dispute in the marxists club on whether history was determined by economic questions alone or by ideas also she grew animated wanted vladimir to hear everything that had been said but he was bored all this was empty talk increasing the profits of his enterprise there was something worth doing and they quarreled again when the two of them were alone together they had nothing to talk about what could they do they telephoned ivan ivanovitch his presence made them feel more at ease vasya was expecting letters from her province but none came neither grusha nor stepan alexeyevitch wrote a line what could be the matter although vasya did not want to admit it even to herself she suspected deep down in her heart that she would be called back to her province to work should she go should she stay a registered letter from home from stepan alexeyevitch short and to the point he proposed that vasya take over the group of the textile factories and organize the work there in a new way as the central administration would prescribe vasya would live there not in the city he asked for an answer vasya s heart pounded she longed for her own people for what was her life here no work no joy only one worry if only nothing happens she seemed to be bound hand and foot she remembered a jackdaw her brother kolyka had owned he had caught it in the woods and had bound its wings so that it couldn t fly away the bird hopped about on the floor opened its beak and turned its bright black eyes toward the window it tried to flap its wings but they were bound fast it tried again a third time cawed with distress and resumed its solemn walk on the floor as if it had never attempted to fly this was what was happening to vasya now her wings were bound too and it was impossible for her to fly but what was binding her wings joy or love no neither of these she was fettered by apprehension by the fear that again something might happen to vladimir by her gratitude to him for staying with her for sending away the hussy slender threads but they were bound tightly about vasya she seemed hopelessly entangled in the net lisa said i don t understand you vassilissa i tell you you re becoming a real manager s lady you can t get away from it how could she break these threads tear the net vasya held stepan alexeyevitch s letter in her hand she felt loath to put it away it seemed to be a talisman that would help her find her way as in the fairy tale vassilissa dementyevna the beer is all gone you ll have to tell vladimir ivanovitch to have some more sent out from the factory otherwise we ll get unexpected guests for dinner and we won t know where to get it from you can t make it out of the air marya semyonovna looked disapprovingly at vasya you re always glum vassilissa dementyevna and why if i might ask that dressed up minx has finally landed in moscow thank god and vladimir ivanovitch is with you now never goes out anywhere why do you sulk so the men don t like that they want their wives to be jolly want to hear them laugh want to have some pleasure at home after the day s work and worries as she listened vasya smiled and thought perhaps she s right perhaps i ought to rouse myself and again become the tomboy vasya of there was a lot of work in those days but a lot of laughter too should she go to see volodya in the office an unexpected visitor tell him about the letter and laughingly say that she would refuse that she could not leave her volodya he would see how she loved him he would be glad would put his arms around her joyfully would kiss her brown eyes he would call her vasya his tomboy she chose a white blouse and put on a blue tie she stood before the mirror as she put on her hat and arranged her curls she wanted to please volodya today for she was bringing him a gift a priceless gift her refusal of stepan alexeyevitch s offer she would go with vladimir to his new position and would undertake some work there when she reached the administration building vasya went to the manager s office it was empty the manager was at a conference but it would soon be over he would probably be back in about ten minutes vasya waited looked through the moscow papers she had to smile at herself now she would make up to volodya for everything for his parting from the other for his greater devotion to herself someone brought in the mail laid it on the manager s desk might there not be some letters for vasya she looked over the business envelopes there suddenly her heart throbbed wildly then seemed to miss a beat a narrow tinted envelope a delicate handwriting as though engraved that could only be the other woman nina constantinovna everything was not over everything was as before lies vasya felt as though she were flying soaring long long endlessly she must have lost her balance for she knocked down the ashtray that stood on the desk as she looked at the narrow tinted envelope vasya felt that it contained her destiny there it disappeared in her pocket now she would learn the truth now there would be an end to the lies vladimir entered together with a member of the administration you re here vasya did you want something or are you just visiting me there s no more beer you ll have to order more from the factory will you look at that you re becoming a housewife i can t recognize my tomboy vasya laughed vladimir quite happily laugh just you laugh but i ll tear through the net in which you have caught me i ll go to the root of this deception what s the trouble vasya can t you stay longer must you go she nodded silently she was trembling with a fury that might break loose any moment she could not wait until she got home to read the letter going to the city park she sat down on a bench and impatiently tore open the tinted envelope my precious volya my king my beloved tormenter again not a word from you the third day without a line can you have forgotten me don t you love your capricious nina any more your little egyptian monkey i don t believe it i don t believe it but it s terrible nevertheless you re with her and i m all alone your mentor will be able to change you she ll convince

we could have a week together to make up for this a week for us only nikanor platonovitch says that in the new district you ll have a splendid house for yourself with a gothic dining room but there s

nina moscow ostoshenka number and not as you wrote last time the letter almost got lost on account of that i m yours from my feet to my lips only your darling sweetheart nina and in the margin imagine how delighted i was to find coty s l origan powder in moscow vasya read nina s letter slowly carefully word for word not only with her eyes but with her heart when she had finished she dropped the letter on her knees looked at the dry dusty grass listened to the angry humming of a bee it flew about busily among the blades rose into the air disappointed and descended into the grass again in the spring when the lilac was blooming there had been bees too but those had been different happy bees this one was angry as if the summer had played it false vasya thought she was thinking of the bee and not of the letter her heart was numb seemed not to ache seemed indifferent to everything satiny arms passionate tenderness it hurt her so slowly painstakingly vasya folded the letter put it back into the envelope getting up she walked toward the gate past the bandstand the park was silent and empty today no music now vasya knew whom vladimir loved knew that not she but the other belonged to him vasya stepped through the gate of the dusty city park into the noisy street she felt as if she had left a grave behind her in the park she was going home from a funeral the burial of her dead happiness chapter xiii vladimir had come home earlier than usual he was smiling with delight for he had good news the long expected summons of the central administration his appointment to the new post had reached him he would have to go to moscow at once to moscow all right go ahead i m going away too but not to moscow i m going home to my province on the surface vasya was calm as she spoke the narrow tinted envelope was in her pocket the letter from nina vladimir didn t notice the weariness in vasya s face he didn t see the angry light that flashed in her brown eyes nor did he wonder why vasya was putting her things in order why she was packing you want to visit your friends all right will we meet in moscow or will you go directly to the new district vasya s heart had had one last hope he would object wouldn t let her go now that too was over i m not going to the new place with you i ve been called back to work and i m going to stay there not for a little while but forever i ve had enough of my rest in this prison i m tired of playing the manager s lady you can take a wife who is able to appreciate this sort of life something seemed to have given way in vasya a torrent of words poured from her mouth she spoke so quickly she had to interrupt herself she wouldn t let herself be deceived any more she was glad their love had come to an end it had been an ordeal for her to be without work among these syndicate people these burshuis she had stood it only for vladimir s sake and she was hurt because he no longer needed her he was using her only as a housekeeper and as a cloak why my wife is a communist but it was the other woman who would give him pleasure and love in the mysterious little house a shrewd plan there was only one thing vladimir and nina had forgotten whether she vasya would agree to lead this disgusting life her eyes were green spiteful she had to pause for lack of breath vladimir shook his head in amazement is that you vasya i don t recognize you if i ever kept anything from you it was only for your sake thanks i don t need your pity i m strong do you think that your love fills my life completely i m sick of your love it s only a thorn in my flesh i want only to get away from you as quickly as possible to tear myself away i m not at all interested in what you do love kiss whomever you please lie deceive forget who you are betray communism it doesn t make any difference vasya vasya what of our friendship what of your promise to understand everything our friendship where is it where s that friendship i don t believe you any more vladimir you ve killed my faith in you if you had come to me and said vasya something terrible something dreadful has happened i love another do you think i would have held you back or reproached you do you think i would have stood in the way of your happiness you see vladimir you forget that i m not merely your wife but your friend and comrade too and that s what hurt me that s what i ll never forgive the tears flowed over her thin cheeks wiping them away with her sleeve she turned her back on vladimir i believed in you as in a comrade but you crushed my faith pitilessly and how can we live together when our faith in each other is gone now i see clearly that our life together our happiness is over vasya s heart was heavy her thin shoulders shook she sat down on the bed crushing the silk quilt in her hands sitting down beside her vladimir put his arm round her did you say that we ve become strangers to each other that you don t love me any more no vasya if you didn t love me you wouldn t suffer so and i have i stopped loving you please try to understand yes i love nina but in a different way my love for you is stronger deeper i can t see any course without you vasya whatever i do i always wonder what would vasya say what would she advise you ve been my guiding star and i need you you re always talking about yourself vasya complained you forget me i can t live that way i m not worrying so much about your getting involved in this affair what hurts me is that we re not comrades any more do you think i don t see that but why i don t know when we re parted we long for each other when we re together we feel cramped you said it used to be different but were we ever together before we never had any family life we were always working saw each other only for a moment shall we live that way again vasya just for the moment would you like that each to live for himself and when we want each other we ll meet yes will you then vasya will be my dear tomboy again the only one in the world and there will be no more lies we mustn t break off everything forever in the heat of the moment that s what hurts have pity on me vladimir buried his head in her lap as he had always done and hid his face in her burning hands the room was quiet a wave of the longing they thought they had forgotten covered both of them with its hot flood the little ember of passion buried under the ashes of suspicion and offended feelings glowed more brightly again vasya darling vladimir s arms embraced vasya and pulled her on his knee he covered her lips with kisses and her body with passionate caresses unresisting vasya yielded to the sweet languor she had almost forgotten let it be so now vladimir loved her as before altogether he belonged to her alone forgot nina he was unfaithful to nina not only with his body but with his heart and his soul vasya felt a malicious joy out of keeping with her usual character it grieved her but she was glad at the same time let him be unfaithful the days that followed were curiously sultry the ember of passion glowing under the ashes of anger and estrangement flared up like a charcoal pile fanned into flames by the autumn wind vladimir had become gentle vasya was loving and yielding they seemed to have fallen in love all over again they could not live without each other at night they lay clasped in each other s arms as though afraid that they might lose each other vladimir kissed vasya s brown eyes vasya pressed vladimir s head to her heart they had never loved never possessed each other like this with bittersweet longing and joy had they found love anew or were they bidding it farewell farewell to their lost irretrievable happiness the while she smiled and joked vasya was afraid of bursting into tears at any moment vladimir caressed her and looked into her brown eyes but she read infinite sadness in his gaze not the mischievous sparkle of joy his eyes did not mirror vasya s love they seemed silently to be saying good bye to her to keep from seeing volodya s eyes and their tears to smother that infinite sadness vasya put her slender arms around volodya s neck she sought his lips he pressed her to his heart she yielded to his passionate caresses he sought her body insatiably until both fell asleep exhausted those were queer days hot sultry gloomy they held no happiness no carefree joy born of love they discussed everything in the meanwhile vasya would go home to her work when vladimir would be settled in his new place they would arrange by letter when they would meet where they said nothing not a word was spoken of the separation everything seemed so simple now so clear and comprehensible as if there were unadulterated truthfulness between them but there was one thing vasya never mentioned that she had taken and hidden nina s letter that she was keeping it because it might some day be useful to her she insisted herself that he should telegraph to moscow that he was coming alone why did she want this it hurt her but somehow it seemed necessary at first vladimir refused and regarded vasya suspiciously as if he were afraid of something but finally he telegraphed nonetheless and became even more loving and ardent it had to be so they were drinking the last drops of happiness that remained in the cup of life and they contained the heady wine of passion the bitter sweetness of parting vasya was gay animated lively volodya had not seen her so for a long time i didn t like my skin so i shed it what sort of manager s lady am i you need another sort of wife beside i m not the least bit suited for the nep laughing she teased volodya i don t know what you are i only know that you ve become vasya the tomboy again and i won t give up my tomboy not even if five party committees demand you for a while yes but for good never vasya laughed that was how it had to be they would meet occasionally as free comrades but not as man and wife that would be better vladimir agreed that it would be better so but he couldn t live without vasya s clever little curly head there are so few friends in the world vasya especially nowadays they re all gone everyone thinks only of himself but we re tried friends and true aren t we vasya they talked together as if the wall between them no longer existed it had been broken down the serpent in vasya s heart lay dormant she thought her jealousy had disappeared but suddenly unexpectedly she felt the sharp fangs again vladimir could not free himself of the past he would talk of nina it showed how frequently he thought of her she was so well educated he said she could speak perfect french with frenchmen german with germans she had learned that in school if she s so well educated why can t she find work or does she prefer to live at the expense of others i suppose her laziness is in her blood besides it s much more comfortable to be your mistress vasya knew she shouldn t say such things but she could not restrain herself the serpent was hurting her and that was why she wanted to strike volodya let him suffer too volodya frowned looked at vasya reproachfully why do you say that vasya it s ugly of you my tomboy vasya wouldn t say that it was another vassilissa dementyevna this stung vasya was ashamed of herself but she could not stop she tried over and over again to wound volodya until he grew furious and she came to her senses don t be angry dear forgive me i love you if i didn t love you i wouldn t torment you so ecstatic kisses two bodies seeking each other deliriously to drown thought and suffering to forget to hide the inevitable truth vasya bade the party committee farewell packed the things in the house she was concerned about everything with the scrubbing rags the hemp mats and the straw she consulted with marya semyonovna held important conferences with her how to pack everything so that nothing would be damaged or broken so that everything would arrive safely in the manager s new home why do you bother so much about it grumbled marya semyonovna if you re going back home why do you work so hard mark my word the moment you re gone that little lady ll be there to take your place and you re working and worrying for her why not let it be so she was not helping him as his wife a wife would never have done it would have condemned vladimir why had he become a burshui but now this had nothing to do with her he was living for himself and she for herself each was going his own way but they were comrades why shouldn t she help him not because he was her husband not because he demanded expected or wished it no but as a comrade as a friend nor was she angry with him if he wanted to take along all that trash and to burden the national freight lines with his cases of dishes and his trunks of silks it was his own affair this was the parting of the ways for them she could not go through life hand in hand with him but why shouldn t she help him pack volodya could not believe his own eyes since when had she become such a housewife he sang her praises to ivan ivanovitch and the members of the administration but again and again he asked vasya who would put his new house in order if she didn t come along who why what s the matter with nina constantinovna or doesn t she want to soil her little white hands she s a fine lady everything has to be prepared for her and handed her on a silver platter by others at the expense of others she had hurt volodya and she was sorry why he looked at her reproachfully as if to ask why vasya my darling my sweetheart i m nasty i know it but it s only because i love you don t be angry dear i was only joking she hid her face on volodya s breast endeavored to swallow the tears that were choking her for she loved him come what might she loved him suffered was afraid of losing him it would be better to die my poor darling my vasyuk i know you that s why i love you why i can t tear my heart away from you there s not another such vasya in all the world i ll never have another friend like you and again that bitter oppressive delirium dulled their senses again they sought to drown their suffering in love will you keep a little corner of your heart free for the rebellious anarchist when you re happy will you think of your tomboy vasya it was a queer time passionate gloomy freedom chapter xiv knock knock knock knock vasya was standing before the locked door of her former attic where grusha was living now she knocked downstairs they had told her that grusha had come home from work but the door was locked where was grusha knock knock knock knock could she be asleep she turned to see grusha coming down the hall with a kettle of hot water grusha vassilissa dearest when did you come so unexpected setting the teakettle on the floor grusha embraced vasya do come in it s your attic after all i owe my living here only to you only wait until i open the door they steal in this house it s terrible i even lock the door when i go for water not long ago they took a coat that was hanging in furyashkin s room a fall coat absolutely new he turned the entire house upside down and even got the police but they didn t find anything so you re home now vassilissa take off your wraps wash off the dust of your trip i was just going to make tea do you want something to eat i have eggs bread and some apples home grusha had said she was at home but could people like vasya have a home she looked about the attic was so familiar but it wasn t vasya s attic any more there was a sewing machine a dressmaker s model in the corner pieces of cloth lying about scraps and short threads on the floor the walls were bare neither marx nor lenin nor the group of tenants celebrating the founding of the community house instead a faded red paper fan beside it a postcard with the picture of an egg and a golden inscription christ hath arisen an ikon in the corner grusha was not a member of the party she believed in god and observed the fasts although she was in favor of the soviet government and had many friends among the communists she had been engaged to be married but her fianc had gone with the whites had probably been killed and if he had been killed the chances were he had been put to death by the red guards that was why grusha refused to become a communist she cherished the memory of her lover if i should join you he would curse me in the other world before vasya had been unable to understand grusha how could she love a white but now she knew that the heart would not obey orders vladimir and she had come to the parting of the ways but her love still was alive gave her no peace grusha was glad that vassilissa had come home she didn t know which would be the best place to give her she fairly overwhelmed her with news and wondered why vasya hadn t gained when she was with her husband she had come back as thin as she had been if not thinner vasya said nothing she had thought that when she would see grusha she would fall into her arms and weeping tell her all her troubles but when they met vasya could not open her mouth could find no words how could she tell anyone about this sorrow the news of vassilissa s arrival spread through the house the old tenants were delighted while the new ones were curious to see what she was like one of the members of the house committee grumbled that now she probably would want to get into the administration again the first to come to grusha s room were the children vasya s old friends of the children s club the older among them immediately had a complaint to lodge the children s club had been broken up at the time of the nep they had said it didn t pay and that the rooms were needed for other purposes but where could the children do their lessons now their collections had been broken up and their library had been scattered some of it had even been sold vasya listened was such a thing possible she bridled at once she would not let the matter rest she would go immediately to the party committee to the educational and housing bureaus let the nep attend to its own business but let it keep its hands off the things the workers had built up laboriously i ll fight them i won t permit such a thing don t worry children i ll see to it that you get what s coming to you even if i have to go to moscow for it the older boys laughed with delight they believed in vasya she would surely attend to it she was going to fight now the whole house knew her as the fighter that was as it should be the children were all for vassilissa after the children the old tenants came in to greet her but the moment they had said good afternoon each of them had an urgent request to make of her everyone had his troubles and wanted to tell her about them vasya listened patiently to them all as always she was interested in everything advised and consoled them the attic was so crowded that it was impossible to turn around wait a little comrades pleaded grusha you re not giving her a chance to eat and she s tired after traveling for so many nights but you have to come in with your affairs and get her all mixed up don t grusha never mind i m not at all tired what were you telling me timofei timofeiyevitch oh yes about the taxes you re supposed to pay how can that be you re no property owner nor an employer or manager as she uttered the word manager she thought of volodya but her pain was submerged in the troubles of others she had no time for it her old friends went away one by one and forgetting her weariness vasya decided to go to party headquarters and get to work immediately she buttoned her coat listening to grusha s news the while one man had married another had left the party this girl had become a member of the council suddenly they heard the voice of the fedosseyev woman resounding through the hall where s our darling our defender my precious vassilissa dementyevna she threw her arms around vasya s neck and covered her with moist kisses at the same time bitter tears were rolling down her cheeks and wet vasya s face i waited for you so long dearest i ve been so lonesome for you i waited for you as for the sunshine when vassilissa dementyevna our protector comes back she ll straighten out everything when she s here the wretch won t dare make his wife a laughing stock he ll be ashamed to disgrace the entire house with that slut she ll sympathize with me because i have to take care of the little children all by myself she ll take him to court at least he ll have to submit to the party you our darling you re my only hope as a rule vasya was able to divine the troubles of others from a few words but this time she couldn t quite make out what the fedosseyev woman was wailing about of whom was she complaining vasya saw that she had changed a great deal almost beyond recognition she had been a young robust full bosomed woman now she had grown thin old and yellow what sorrow was breaking her heart fedosseyev had entered on a love affair with dora an unbaptized jewess he wanted to have nothing to do with his wife made her the laughing stock of the entire district no one could make him ashamed of himself he had left his own children was bringing everything to his sweetheart here little girl that s for you let the family die in their corner only don t chase me away me your pock marked lover what in the world did that goose dora see in him shrieked the fedosseyev woman if he were a real man but he s disgusting he s so damned filthy i put up with him for eight years kissed his pock marked phiz for the children s sake vassilyevitch i thought you re an ass but fate brought us together and the church married us so i ll have to stand you when he would be insistent he d make me sick but i endured him never looked at anyone else i thought he d be grateful to me i gave all my youth to the filthy beast and that s what i get for it i lost my good looks and he ran after that girl he had to get mixed up with a jewish girl it s a disgrace for the whole district the fedosseyev woman wept uncontrollably vasya listened and her own heart seemed filled with a dark flood here she found her own grief and indignation all over again she shuddered with disgust where had her pluck gone she no longer felt any desire to go to the party committee she wanted only to bury her head in her pillow and to see nothing more the other however continued to sob to kiss vassilissa s shoulder to beg her to bring her husband to reason and to defend the interests of the little children she should threaten him with a court trial as she went home from party headquarters vasya was surrounded by her comrades they couldn t stop talking and vasya felt so happy and gay she had forgotten everything as if she had never lived for or worried about anything but the party she had grown excited had quarreled and stood her ground she had asked questions about everything and had found out just how the land lay it had interested and satisfied her her head was working her soul seemed to rise she hurried up to her attic without noticing the stairs only then she felt her weariness while grusha was preparing supper vasya lay down on the bed and fell asleep at once grusha looked at her friend undecided as to whether she should wake her she felt sorry for her vasya was exhausted let her sleep she undressed vasya as though she were a child took off her shoes and covered her she hung a shade over the light and sat down to sew button holes knock knock who the devil could be coming now grusha muttered angrily they never let a person alone she opened the door there stood fedosseyev the husband what do you want i want to see vassilissa dementyevna is she at home are you all crazy she s had a long trip she s tired hasn t had a chance to sleep and you fall on her like a pack of hungry dogs on a bone vassilissa dementyevna is asleep grusha and fedosseyev had words fedosseyev was obstinate but grusha refused to let him in tomorrow they agreed on the next day she banged the door in fedosseyev s face a damned filthy fellow had a wife and three children and dora was big too it was beyond grusha she considered that fedosseyev was in the wrong and she condemned dora too why had she started anything with a married man weren t there enough bachelors grusha s morals were very strict she kept within bounds for she still remembered her lover when vasya woke up she felt calm and at peace with the world the autumn sun was shining through the window throwing a golden light on the seamstress grusha was heating her flatiron on the petroleum stove she was going to iron a dress for whom is it for a member of the executive committee for a birthday party what are they celebrating birthdays nowadays i should say so you ought to see them it s better than it used to be with the rich people the table is covered with appetizers wine whiskey grusha s iron was hissing she had no time to talk vasya stretched on the bed she remembered it well it was hard and narrow yet she had slept in it together with volodya how had they ever had room now they had been in each other s way even in a wide bed it had been different in the old days was her misery trying to creep into her heart again to disturb her peace of mind no everything was quiet in her heart the calm that follows a storm grusha remembered the appointment with fedosseyev and told vasya about it i don t care let him come she didn t want to have too much to do with the fedosseyevs she seemed offended because these gossips had been overtaken by the same misfortune as she she inquired about dora who was she don t you remember her grusha was amazed she s dark and pretty she danced with the tambourine at the komsomolsk celebration now vasya recalled her very favorably she had worked in the tanners cultural committee a clever girl and her youth was no drawback besides she sang well how could the fedosseyev woman think of comparing with her grusha s view was different she condemned dora the laws had to be observed if the communists were to permit husbands to act that way all the men would desert their wives and little children and would take on young girls the party was going to take proceedings against dora take proceedings against her only the fedosseyev woman could be behind that a disgusting creature vasya defended dora no law could force a man to live with a woman he doesn t love do you want to force him to embrace that woman even though he loathes her even though she s a common sneak vasya was quite wrought up she was furious with the fedosseyev woman and why she hardly knew herself as she fought about the fedosseyevs she thought of vladimir as she defended dora she saw the white lace parasol and nina s red lips grusha was surprised to see vassilissa siding with fedosseyev you act as if they were your best friends weren t you always railing against them you know how much trouble they caused you of course it s your own affair but i d advise you to keep out of this business there s no use in getting mixed up in a dog fight vasya was stubborn she would stand up for dora if there were proceedings against her tell me if you please does fedosseyev s legal wife think she s the only one who has rights no she s mistaken there are other rights not dictated by human laws they are the commands of the heart as grusha pressed the hem of the dress she looked at vasya attentively as if to read her friend s innermost thoughts vasya frowned why did grusha object wasn t vasya right could any law dictate to the heart who said so the heart is most important of all you can t be human if you haven t a heart but as i look at you now i see clearly that you re heart sick too vassilissa that you re suffering that s why you re defending fedosseyev you re thinking of your man aren t you and you want to find an excuse for him i m right vasya said nothing but bowed her head grusha asked no more questions taking the dress from the ironing board she shook it out and picked off the loose threads now it was finished are you through asked vasya thinking of something quite different yes well then i ll go to the party committee let fedosseyev wait now came days of hard work for vassilissa she was preparing to leave for the weaving works she conferred with stepan alexeyevitch acquainted herself with her instructions and spent her evenings at meetings of her responsible co workers the hours passed so quickly that she had no time to think or to listen to her heart and then she had her new worries about the fedosseyevs and dora they and their difficulties gave vasya no rest fedosseyev had come to her and had told her everything he had met dora abramovna in the cultural committee he had been singing in the chorus dora abramovna liked his bass and took him to a music teacher she was a musician herself and she had brought him into the cultural committee that was how it had begun but his wife soon got wind of it and then there was trouble fedosseyev complained about his wife she was spreading all sorts of rumors and was setting the comrades against dora abramovna she was wailing that dora was robbing her family and was letting fedosseyev support her the truth was quite the opposite not only did dora refuse to accept a single kopek from fedosseyev but she even helped the family sharing everything with them she thought of the children too had brought the younger ones into the kindergarten and had given textbooks and copybooks to the oldest boy who went to school of course she didn t want the wife to know that besides she had made a shirt and tie for fedosseyev to wear to the concerts but the malicious gossips had it just the other way fedosseyev was grieved on dora s account it wouldn t hurt him but he was worried about her lest she get into difficulties with the party because of him it was all his wife s fault she insisted on being in their way listening to fedosseyev vasya couldn t help thinking of vladimir and nina they too had suffered like this had sought a way out had been angry at vasya because she prevented them from being happy she had advised the fedosseyev woman to get out of the way of her own accord it was impossible to block the happiness of others no matter how many barriers you would put in its path you couldn t keep it from flying over your head but what was vasya herself doing was not she too standing in the way was she not still standing guard over the happiness that had been fedosseyev loved dora when he spoke of her his face seemed to shine she had seen the same change in vladimir when he thought of nina dora abramovna has a heart of gold in the union everybody s fond of her too those who don t belong to the party don t think it ll take any action against her but if it does they ll be only too happy let her come to us independents we ll take dora abramovna s part never fear fedosseyev had hardly left vasya when his wife caught hold of her kissed her shoulders and begged her to be on her side vasya who didn t like fedosseyeva crossly waved her away whereupon she filled the entire house with her shouting about dora about her husband and about vasya abusing all three of them at once vasya met dora at party headquarters they found a corner where the typists were busily pounding away at their machines where the noise permitted them to talk without being overheard dora was pretty with clever eyes vasya liked her she was trying to hide her pregnancy with a shawl dora began to speak of her own accord not of herself but of fedosseyev she looked after him esteemed him admired his talent his voice was excellent as good as chaliapin s all he needed was to study that was why dora wanted to marry him so that he could break away from his family and from his cobbling so that he could devote himself entirely to his singing but although she spoke highly of fedosseyev dora also bewailed his indecision as long as he was with her he was prepared to do anything fully determined to leave his wife and put through the divorce but as soon as he came home it was finished he would give in and she would have to begin all over again she had been working on him for so many months and unsuccessfully vasya grew disturbed as she listened to dora might not nina have spoken of vladimir in the same way dora didn t care a rap for all the formalities of divorce and marriage it was all nonsense in her eyes she favored a free union but fedosseyeva would never let them live in peace unless they were registered in the commissariat therefore dora was making the most of her being in the family way to move fedosseyev and induce him to get the divorce she wasn t afraid of motherhood she would be able to take care of herself without a husband too to move him to force him to get the divorce had nina done that too dora praising fedosseyev was expecting vasya to voice her approval but vasya was thinking of her own troubles dora saw only the good in fedosseyev nina probably loved vladimir in the same way vasya was different she saw vladimir s bad points too she loved him and suffered for his faults they distressed her and she wanted to reform him might this not have hurt volodya why does his wife cling to him so dora spoke wrathfully because they used to love each other but that was so long ago now there s nothing to keep them together she doesn t really know him she can t appreciate him she doesn t understand him at all ah thought vasya that s how it was with vladimir and me he didn t know what i wanted and i couldn t understand his ideas our paths went off in different directions he s a stranger to his wife they re different in every respect in their tastes and in their ideals she wants to keep him as a husband but she doesn t need him as a man he s not essential in her life and she vasya did she need vladimir as a man was he essential to her as she asked herself this question her heart answered distinctly no she did not need him not as he was now but dora could not help going on what sort of love is that they can t bear each other it s a cat and dog life every man for himself neither friendship nor faith in each other yes thought vasya yes neither friendship nor faith in each other and we comrade fedosseyev and i understand each other as if we had only one heart one soul so that was the love of vladimir and nina vasya seemed to understand it only now she grew thoughtful she had much to do urgent party affairs preparations for her departure yet she didn t forget the fedosseyevs she did her best to hasten the divorce tried to reconcile fedosseyev with his comrades and to defend dora all this seemed important very important for vasya she couldn t explain why vasya was hurrying home from party headquarters she was to leave for the weaving works the next day her head was whirling how reorganize the work follow orders and adapt herself to the many who didn t belong to the party the independents were just like the communists nowadays they wanted to penetrate more and more deeply into everything to investigate everything themselves they took nothing on faith if you didn t have a sound basis for your statements you might just as well not talk to them her head was full of all this she seemed to have forgotten her heartache she felt as if she had never lost her man her friend as if she had not lived through an entire summer as the manager s lady vasya hurried along she had had nothing to eat since morning and when she thought of food she felt sick everything seemed to grow dark her head was reeling how long was she going to be ill or a suspicion rose in her mind it was almost three months since her last period oughtn t she to look up marya andreyevna the physician she lived right here in one of the side streets they had worked together in the organization of the nursery for the community houses she would have to find out what the trouble was vasya couldn t go to her new work if she was sick she turned into the side street went up to the little white house and rang the bell the physician marya andreyevna opened the door herself how in the world did you happen to come here is it a business matter or do you want my professional advice vasya was on pins and needles she felt embarrassed and even blushed after watching her carefully for a while marya andreyevna put her hand on her shoulder come into my office i ll examine you marya andreyevna inquired about vasya s appetite her periods her dizziness she seemed to know everything in advance she examined vasya it was disagreeable and embarrassing for vasya she had never consulted a gynecologist before she was almost frightened when she had to sit down on the examination chair as she dressed her hands trembled so that she couldn t fasten the hooks marya andreyevna stood before the wash stand in her white smock and painstakingly scrubbed her hands with soap and a brush for a while neither spoke well dear comrade vassilissa i don t know whether you ll be glad or sorry but there s no doubt about it you re in the family way vasya was surprised but in a moment a smile flitted over her face a baby that would be nice will you go back to your husband now asked the white smocked physician as she dried her hands on an embroidered towel to my husband no vasya shook her head i m not going back to him we ve separated each of us is going his own way you ve separated this is a fine time for it how will you arrange things now we may yet be able to stop the business what do you say where will you go all alone with your child you re not strong i m not alone though tomorrow i m leaving for the weaving works there s a fine group there mostly women weavers we ll all work together there organize a nursery oh yes that s what i wanted to ask you how did you make the nursery self supporting tell me about it please and advise me they discussed the nursery subsidies contributions the payment of professional employes vasya forgot the news about herself marya reminded her of it when she was leaving don t undertake too much work remember that your health is none too good i m afraid for you my dear she gave vasya some advice one thing was prohibited while another was good for her vasya listened and tried to remember everything for the child s sake it should be a strong baby it was so little so helpless she reached the street smiled as she walked along a baby that would be nice she would show the other women how to raise a child in the communist way there was no need for a kitchen for family life and all that nonsense the thing to do was to organize a nursery a self supporting community house practice was better than preaching vasya was so occupied with the idea of self support that she even forgot her child the thought of vladimir however never entered her mind as though he had had nothing to do with it vasya was packing a box containing volodya s picture and his letters fell over on the top of the pile lay a narrow tinted envelope nina constantinovna s letter vasya looked at it turned it over and over she knew it by heart yet she wanted to read it again it would revive her heartache but she could not resist it whenever she read it the old pain again gnawed at her heart then it would freeze that was her wrath against vladimir why had he lied why had he deceived her she took up the letter went closer to the window it was growing dark she unfolded the familiar sheet she read it carefully every word but the gnawing pain was gone and the serpent that venomous tormentor seemed to have lost its strength instead vasya felt pity stirring in her heart sympathy for nina constantinovna s tears sympathy with the grief the sorrow the distress of another woman s heart she remembered nina going away from the bandstand wiping away her tears with her fingers why had she suffered why had she exposed herself to such anguish she had expected a baby and she had got rid of it why going over to the table vasya pushed aside grusha s pieces of cloth set down the ink and began to write a letter nina constantinovna i don t know you have no idea of what you really are i ve seen you only once and i will tell you quite frankly that i didn t like you but when you cried as you went away from the bandstand my heart understood your pain and suffered with you i have just reread your letter to vladimir ivanovitch i m returning it to you my taking it was quite unwarranted and i kept it from vladimir but it has served its purpose so you needn t be angry with me on this account i ve thought a great deal about your letter now that i have just reread it i know that i cherish no grudge against you that i m not angry with you any more i see that you too have suffered much because of me let me therefore tell you what i ve already told vladimir we ve had enough of this game of hide and seek you must become vladimir ivanovitch s wife his legal wife the two of you are better suited to each other i m not the proper wife for him for our tastes differ and our lives run in different directions i never know what he thinks and he doesn t understand me when we separated vladimir and i it was not because you had stolen him away from me you could take possession of his heart only because he no longer loved me i shall continue to live now just as i used to live before without vladimir you however actually can not live without him it is always so when two people love each other vladimir ivanovitch and i lived in a free union so that no divorce is required i do not reproach you if i had known sooner how you love each other i would have done this long ago tell vladimir ivanovitch that i feel no bitterness toward him but will always be his friend as i always used to be and should you ever need anything i shall always be ready to help you or to be of service to you there was a time when my heart held little love for you but now that i understand everything i feel only deep sympathy for you for all your tears for the suffering and heartache of a woman i wish you great happiness as i would a sister remember me to vladimir and tell him to take good care of his bride in any case i m giving you my new address if you want to write me i will answer for we aren t enemies nina constantinovna even though unintentionally we caused each other much pain neither of us wanted to hurt the other good bye i wish you all the happiness in the world vassilissa malygina at the end of the letter she wrote down her exact address then she put both letters into an envelope moistened the flap with her tongue and pasted it together then suddenly her soul not her reason told her this is the end the end but where was the pain there was no pain where was her grief her gnawing benumbing grief the grief too had gone volodya the american was there not vladimir ivanovitch she thought of vladimir and saw nina she thought of nina and vladimir appeared beside her as though they had become one for vasya one indivisible inseparable one the thought of it did not hurt her let them be one her heart was calm full of peace like a garden after a tempest vasya stood beside the window enjoying the sunset the sun was sinking behind purple gold edged clouds as in a storm the crows were circling over the earth cawing seeking a shelter for the night the air smelled of dry leaves mushrooms and autumn earth fragrant refreshing familiar not spicy and enervating as in vladimir s country vasya drew a deep breath avidly drinking in the air yes life was beautiful she leaned out of the window in the little courtyard grusha was hastening to get the clean clothes off the line while it was still daylight grusha grusha come here quick i have some news good news i m on my way she came in threw the laundry on the bed what s the news did you get a letter a letter yes it s a letter but i didn t get it i wrote it guess to whom to none other than vladimir ivanovitch i m sure but you re wrong not to him but to the little lady his wife nina constantinovna grusha was astonished why did you do that you see grusha when i read that letter of nina s over again i felt so sorry for her after all she suffered too on my account and she lost a baby because of me she endured everything grieved was miserable and why we re not rivals after all we re not enemies if she had taken vladimir from me in cold blood without love i would never have forgiven her would always have been furious at her but now that i really understand her for she loves vladimir she loves him very much more than i do and she s right life without vladimir means nothing to her that s why she writes i can t live without you do i need vladimir i ve thought it over grusha many times and now i realize that i won t grieve for him if volodya the american could come back it would be different i long for him grusha for the old volodya but you see the american doesn t exist any more and he ll never return so why should i torment nina why disturb the happiness of these two what do i care about the manager i don t need him yes agreed grusha you don t need the manager that s the worst of it the way so many of our men have deserted us to become managers but don t be unhappy vassilissa there are plenty of our boys left just look at those who don t belong to the party you ll find true communists among them real proletarian communists of course we re getting new recruits but the others they exchanged their proletarianism long ago for lamps and quilts they don t understand us so you see grusha i thought why torment nina why hold on to vladimir he was neither married nor free what was the sense in that state of affairs it would have to be stopped and that without bitterness they had suffered enough i didn t quite understand all this when i left vladimir i was still expecting something hoping for something i thought that if vladimir left me for another woman i would die of grief i was numbed with pain when i came here i didn t even notice the trip but when i went to work in the party committee when others came to me with their worries and troubles it seemed to me that my sorrow was gone will you believe me i can honestly say that i feel neither bitterness nor jealousy everything is calm and quiet mother of god i thank thee grusha quickly crossed herself and glanced at the ikon in the corner i did not kneel and pray to our holy lady all these nights in vain vassilissa help a woman s heart i prayed help vassilissa vasya smiled stop grusha you re incorrigible do you still believe in ikons but what you said is true i m cured how many months was i walking about like a somnambulist i wasn t conscious i didn t live i forgot the party but now i m well again everything delights me now everything s new to me the old world still goes round vladimir may be gone but the party is there that s how i felt after i had typhus when i began to recuperate i m only afraid that you ll have another attack that your husband ll write some more of those damned letters of his no grusha that won t happen again thoughtfully vasya shook her head my heart has changed altogether i resent nothing reproach him with nothing my jealousy of nina has disappeared but my pity for them remains all three of us were lost in a labyrinth we were angry at one another and we couldn t find the way out before we had lost our bitterness when i took nina into my heart i stepped out of that maze of suffering it was not because i forgave her what did i have to forgive but i sympathized with her as with a sister for she had known a woman s pain and had suffered as much as i not through her own fault but because life still hasn t reached the ideal i pitied her and i felt better and it couldn t be otherwise if you don t love him any more love always brings suffering it gives you a little joy but sorrow follows it like a shadow and when you feel no more pain your love s at an end too that s not true grusha you mustn t look at things that way vasya shook her head i haven t stopped loving vladimir he s still in my heart but my love has changed it no longer makes me miserable i m not angry at him any more i am grateful to him for the love that has been for the happiness we felt together why should i be vexed with vladimir as long as he loved me we were happy now he has stopped loving me who s to blame for that i thank him for what has been i feel as if vladimir had become my brother and nina my sister i can t quite see your regarding nina as a sister you re trying to fool yourself vassilissa don t try to be too clever don t be a super communist of course it s better that you ve forgiven vladimir about nina forgiven and forgotten out of your heart and out of your mind but as for love don t keep your love your heart for the workers instead they re having a hard time now many of them have lost faith in themselves they don t get much out of your party doctrines give them something more food and warmth for the heart i m not a member of the party but i see everything nevertheless just ask me vassilissa and i ll always tell you the truth i know you re with us grusha we all know that but why do you still insist on believing in your ikons now don t pout don t be offended i won t say another word i won t tease you any more and i won t quarrel with you i m in such a festive mood today grusha i feel so happy so gay so free and do you know who cured me do you try to guess i can t imagine the fedosseyevs you don t mean it then let that fedosseyev woman be forgiven for all her sins and meanness they laughed but i haven t even told you the biggest news of all grusha i saw the doctor i m expecting a baby a baby grusha clapped her hands really then how could you let your husband go will you let the baby be fatherless or are you going to be fashionable and have an abortion why an abortion let the child grow i don t need a man that s all they can do be fathers look at the fedosseyev woman with her three children they didn t keep her husband from going to dora that s all very well but how will you bring it up all by yourself all by myself the organization will bring it up we ll fix up a nursery and i ll bring you over to work there you like children too then it ll be our baby we ll have it in common again they laughed but now grusha i have to hurry with my packing the train leaves early in the morning i m going to my work tomorrow i m going to arrange everything just as i want it stepan alexeyevitch has given me his blessing back to work grusha do you realize the joy of that she seized grusha s hands and the two danced about the room like children they almost knocked over the dressmaker s model they laughed uproariously even the people downstairs in the courtyard could hear them we must live grusha live finis end of the project gutenberg ebook red love
