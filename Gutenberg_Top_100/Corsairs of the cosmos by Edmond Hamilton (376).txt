                 a stupendous story of the interstellar
               patrol  an amazing weird scientific tale
              of an invasion from outside the universe

 what was the greatest adventure that you ever took part in during your
service in the interstellar patrol  

that is a question which i  dur nal  captain in the patrol  and my two
officers are often asked 

my own answer is   i believe our space fight with the serpent people
was the wildest adventure ever we had  

korus kan  my first officer  disagrees   it was the time that we were
drawn into the dark nebula  

and jhul din  my big second officer  differs with both of us and says 
 that time we penetrated inside a comet was by far the most venturous  

to settle this difference of opinion i once put the question to lacq
larus  chief of the interstellar patrol 

lacq larus knew of every venture we of the service had ever engaged
upon  he considered for a long time before he answered me 

 dur nal   he told me finally   i think that the time we fought the
cosmic corsairs was the wildest any of us ever saw  

and looking back  i am not sure but that lacq larus is right  for
certainly that was the maddest space struggle in which even the oldest
veterans of the patrol ever took part 

my cruiser had just returned to headquarters at canopus when the
thing first burst upon us  our ship had been engaged for long weeks
patrolling a lonely section of the galaxy beyond mira  policing space
between the suns and seeing that law was maintained in the interstellar
void 

we had been glad enough when our relief came and we could return to
headquarters  at full speed we flew across the galaxy between suns and
nebul  until at last we were watching canopus  worlds come out of the
huge white sun s glare as our cruiser swept in toward them 

but our stay at headquarters was to be short  for when i went up into
the great tower that holds the central authority of the interstellar
patrol  and reported our return to lacq larus  the chief  i found that
a new assignment awaited us 

 dur nal  i m sorry to send you right back out into space   lacq larus
told me   but there s a job to be done  

 what is it  sir   i asked   a little meteor sweeping to be done  

 no  the space routes of the galaxy are all clear at the moment   the
chief answered   but i ve just had a report from the astronomers at
betelgeuse that a number of celestial bodies are approaching our galaxy
from outer space  they report that there are about twenty of these
bodies  that they are non luminous and are apparently a group of dark
stars  they are approaching with phenomenal speed and will reach our
galaxy at a point near betelgeuse  

 and you want us to go out and investigate these oncoming dark stars  
i guessed as he paused 

lacq larus nodded   yes  i want you to take a squadron of cruisers and
go out into outer space to meet them  you will ascertain the exact
course and speed of these dark stars and determine accurately where and
when they will enter our galaxy  then return here at once with your
report  

i saluted   very well  sir  if the cruisers are ready we ll start at
once  

 the squadron is waiting for you now down in the docks   lacq larus
said  and he called after me as i went out   i ll see that you get the
leave due you when you return  

                                        

i went down to the great docks beside the tower  in which were resting
or refitting hundreds of ships of the interstellar patrol  most
numerous among them were the long  cigar shaped cruisers  the swiftest
ships in space  grim beam tubes projecting from their sides 

there were also slower  broader beamed meteor sweeps  observation ships
fitted with elaborate instruments  heat cruisers such as are used for
close work with nebul  and suns  and representatives of all the other
classes of ships in the patrol 

i found the squadron of twenty five cruisers assigned me  waiting with
all officers and crews aboard  then i went on to my own cruiser and
as i neared the dock where it rested i saw beside it a small crowd of
patrol officers listening to some one discoursing in a loud voice 
as i drew nearer i saw that the speaker was a big  bulky figure and
recognized him as jhul din  my second officer 

beside him  listening in some amusement  was korus kan  my first
officer  and the other officers were hanging on his words 

     and we ran our ship at full speed right through that
meteor swarm   jhul din was saying   we went so fast that not a cursed
meteor in the whole swarm ever touched us  

 but weren t you afraid to head your cruiser into a meteor swarm like
that   asked a young officer 

jhul din stared at him   afraid  you won t know what it is to be afraid
when you ve spent as much time out in space as i have  

 well  you re going to spend a little more time in space right now   i
broke in   jhul din  call the crew to stations at once  

he looked at me in dismay   you don t mean that we re going out on
patrol again  dur nal  not when we ve just come in  

 we re going out again  but not on patrol   i told him  and informed
them briefly of the mission lacq larus had assigned to us 

 why did the chief have to pick on us   jhul din exclaimed   look how
long it ll take us to go outside the galaxy far enough to meet those
dark stars  

 well  it can t be helped   i said as we entered the cruiser   the
sooner you quit complaining and we get started  the sooner we ll be
back  

he left us  still grumbling  and i heard his deep voice calling the
crew to their posts as korus kan and i climbed to the cruiser s
bridge room 

 is everything in order for a start   i asked korus kan and he saluted 

 everything in order  all generators and projectors satisfactory 
air tanks and supply rooms full  all beam tubes working  

 very well   i said  and picked up the space phone by which i could
communicate with the other cruisers of my squadron 

 dur nal speaking  we will start in five minutes   i ordered   triangle
formation  and keep at two light speeds until we clear canopus  

as the captains of the other cruisers responded their understanding  i
turned to the pilot who had just come up into the bridge room   start
in four minutes  jan allon   i ordered   lay our course for betelgeuse
for the present  

i heard jhul din bellow an order down below and the space doors clanged
shut  then the whining hum of the great generators in the lower deck
began 

jan allon waited for a few moments  then threw on the power and pulled
the cruiser s wheel slightly toward him  our ship arrowed up at once
into the sunlight  the other cruisers following close behind in the
familiar triangle formation of the patrol 

in a short time our squadron was clear of canopus  and with the huge
sun glaring behind us like a great white eye we were racing across the
galaxy s spaces at many light speeds toward betelgeuse  we followed the
straightest possible course  and this took us past the orion nebula 
which lies almost directly on the space route between canopus and
betelgeuse  the nebula bulked for billions of miles in space beside
us  a stupendous burning cloud along whose edge our comparatively tiny
cruiser crawled 

                                        

once the mighty nebula was behind us  it was not long before our
squadron reached betelgeuse and the galaxy s edge  there was no need
for us to halt at betelgeuse  so we passed that sun and in a short
time were passing clear out of the galaxy into outer space 

behind us lay the galaxy  a colossal swarm of suns floating in the
infinitude of space  before us lay only space itself  vast  lightless 
empty  far  far across its unthinkable reaches glowed a few little
patches of soft  hazy light  galaxies as large as our own but so far
away they were hardly visible 

out in space some distance from our galaxy we could descry with our
instruments a group of dark bodies coming toward us  they were the
score of dark stars approaching the galaxy from the outer emptiness 
our squadron headed right out into the infinite toward them 

korus kan took observations on the dark stars as we approached them 
while jhul din and i watched 

he found that they were all of large size and that they were coming on
with astounding speed 

 they re moving faster than any dark star i ever heard of before  
korus kan told us 

 that s all the better   jhul din grunted   we ll meet them the sooner
and can get back sooner into the galaxy  

we watched as the black globes of the oncoming dark stars became dimly
visible in the blackness ahead  then i gave an order for the squadron
to slacken speed 

 when we meet the dark stars we ll turn and move above them and with
them  back toward the galaxy   i directed   long enough to investigate
them  

in a short time the dark stars had grown to huge black worlds booming
toward us close ahead 

we ascended to a higher level and prepared to turn and follow above
them when they reached us  they came on with truly amazing velocity 
those mighty burned out cinders that long ago had been suns 

from what far region of space had they come  i wondered  how came these
dark wanderers to be rushing through outer space far from whatever
galaxy had been their origin  what chance had led them through infinity
toward our own galaxy 

musing on this  i watched as our squadron passed close over the group 
executed a broad turn  and then came back and flew above the dark stars
toward the galaxy 

now we were almost stupefied to find that they were moving through
space nearly half as fast as our swift ships could move 

 by all the suns  this is incredible   i cried   these dark stars are
moving faster than any celestial body was ever known to move  

korus kan s eyes were excited   there s something strange about this
whole business  wait and i ll take some observations  

as he trained his instruments on the hurtling worlds below  jhul din
and i stared down at them in increasing amazement 

 maybe there has been a cosmic convulsion in some other galaxy that
hurled these dead suns into outer space   jhul din suggested 

 even that wouldn t account for their tremendous velocity   i was
saying  when korus kan interrupted 

 by the suns  it s as i suspected   he cried   those dark stars are
propelled by artificial power  

we turned our stare on him   what are you saying  

 it s the truth   korus kan affirmed   our instruments show that
they are being impelled through space by super powerful propulsion
vibrations like those that impel our ships  it means that the dark
stars have been fitted with huge generators and projectors and
controls  and are being driven through space like so many colossal
ships  

 it can t be   jhul din exclaimed incredulously   whoever heard of dead
suns the size of those being propelled artificially  

but rapidly i was thinking   i believe that korus kan is right   i
said   and if these dark stars are really being propelled deliberately
through space  it means that there are living creatures of some kind on
them directing their flight  

 why have they steered their twenty worlds across the outer void toward
our galaxy  where have they come from and for what   jhul din asked 

 we must learn the answer to these questions and report to
headquarters  this matter may be of import to our whole galaxy  

 shall we descend and land on one of those dark stars to investigate 
then   asked jhul din 

quickly i considered   there s no need to imperil our whole squadron  
i said 

i grasped the space phone and spoke to the other ships   it appears
that these twenty dark stars are being deliberately propelled toward
our galaxy  no doubt by beings of some sort upon them   i stated   our
cruiser is going to descend to investigate  all others of the squadron
will remain at their present level  and if we do not rejoin you within
two hours you will return at full speed toward the galaxy and report
what has happened at headquarters  

from the captains of the other cruisers came assent to the order  and
then i turned to the pilot   very well  jan allon  descend toward the
foremost of the dark stars  

                                        

in tense silence korus kan and jhul din and i watched as our cruiser
shot down through space toward the first of the onrushing dead suns 
what would we find there  we waited in taut anticipation as the ship
dropped down through the millions of miles 

presently korus kan spoke   none of the dark stars seems to have any
atmospheric halo   he said 

 what kind of creatures could exist on worlds without atmosphere   jhul
din marvelled 

the foremost dark star s surface rushed up toward us  we saw on it
crowded movement  a stir of hosts of moving things 

 there s life of some kind down there  all right   said jhul din 

then as our ship raced lower an exclamation of utter astonishment came
from me   life  this isn t a world of life as we know it  it s a world
of machines  

for the moving things that existed in hosts on the dark star were all
machines 

the twilight surface of the star was crowded with their numbers  there
were towering machines that stalked to and fro  many limbed mechanisms
such as i had never seen  and dozens of other kinds 

the eye could not count them  so great were their numbers  there was no
other life or moving things in sight  here was mystery of the cosmos 
dark  enigmatic  how came the active and apparently masterless machines
to be peopling these dirigible worlds 

 by the suns  there must be people of some kind here   exclaimed jhul
din   if not  who made these machines  

korus kan uttered a sharp cry   dur nal  some of the machines are
coming up toward us  

a hundred or more mechanisms had risen from the dark star and were
flying swiftly up through space toward us 

these mechanisms had no occupants  no operators  they were simply
masterless machines flying in space  disk like in shape and with tubes
much like beam tubes projecting from them 

 they may be going to attack us   jhul din warned   shall we beam them  

 no  don t loose a single beam   i commanded   there are a hundred of
them to our one  

the flying mechanisms came rapidly up  swarmed in a crowd around
our descending cruiser  there was something chilling and uncanny at
the sight of the metal machines acting with apparent volition and
intelligence  they seemed watching us  but made no move to attack us  i
had a lively sense  though  that they were only waiting for an untoward
movement on our part to leap upon us 

 keep descending   i told the pilot   they re not going to harm us at
present  apparently  

 there s a clear space down there to the left that looks like the
center of activities  sir   the pilot reported to me 

 land there  then   i directed 

the spot on the dark star s surface toward which we now descended was a
clear circle surrounded by hosts of machines  as our ship slanted down
toward it  with the flying mechanisms keeping in a close swarm around
us  i turned 

 jhul din  order every one in the ship to don space suits   i
commanded   there is no atmosphere on this world  

                                        

jan allon turned to me and saluted   we have landed  sir  

 i am going to emerge  korus kan and jhul din and five of the crew will
accompany me   i said   the rest will remain in the cruiser and in case
of accident to us will attempt to escape with the ship  

with my two officers i went down from the bridge room to the lower deck 

 open the space door   i ordered 

the heavy door swung  and with jhul din and korus kan and our five
followers i stepped out onto the dark star s surface 

we looked about us  we stood in an unimaginably weird and alien scene 
a thick twilight lay over everything  but half way up to the zenith in
the black heavens glittered a great swarm of stars  it was our galaxy 
toward which these dark star worlds were rushing 

all around us in that twilight  surrounding with their hosts the clear
circular space in which our cruiser had landed  towered the mighty
machines  they were now motionless  as though they were watching us 
with a chilling of my blood i knew that they  were  watching us 

across the circle from us loomed a huge panel  and beside it great
levers and wheels  near this stood a half dozen curious  squat  cowled
mechanisms resting each on three metal limbs 

korus kan touched my arm  whispered   dur nal  that panel and the
levers  they must be the controls by which this dark star is propelled
and steered through space  

 we ll go over toward them  then   i said   if there s any center of
authority  it will be there  

as we neared the huge controls a stir went through the machine giants
around the clearing  menacing  watchful 

 by the suns  these cursed machines are all  alive    muttered jhul din 

we stopped before the six cowled mechanisms that stood by the controls 
some instinct told me of power  of authority  concentrated in them 

then out from one of those squat  cowled machines came a clear
thought message  impinging directly on my mind  the machine was
speaking to us 

 you are inhabitants of the galaxy which our twenty dark stars are now
approaching   it asked 

 we are   i answered  projecting the thought toward it   are you
machines the only inhabitants of these dark stars  it is you who are
steering them toward our galaxy  

 it is   the machine replied   we come from one of the galaxies nearest
in space to your own galaxy  and that one from which we come is a
galaxy inhabited only by machines like ourselves  

 a whole galaxy peopled only by machines   i said   how can such a
thing be  

 it has been so for countless ages   the mechanism answered   long ago
we machines came to power in that galaxy and we have retained it ever
since  

 but how did these machines come into existence in the first place  
korus kan whispered  beside me 

the cowled mechanism must have caught his thought   in our galaxy
in the far past   it told us   there existed a race of beings who
were not mechanisms but were living things similar to yourselves 
they constructed many and diverse machines to aid in their conquest
of nature  and they made those machines ever more automatic and
self sufficient  finally they devised mechanisms that possessed a
mechanical brain structure capable of memory and association and
decision  machines that could think  these thinking machines soon came
to be superior in capabilities to their living creators  with unerring
logic they recognized this fact and saw themselves better fitted to
rule than their creators  so they rebelled against those who had made
them and destroyed them all 

 since then we machines have ruled supreme and alone in that galaxy and
long ago spread out to every part of it and now are masters of all its
suns and worlds  

 a machine race rebelling against its creators   jhul din exclaimed
incredulously   and these metal monsters rule a whole galaxy  

 quiet  jhul din   i ordered   we ve got to find out what they ve come
to our own galaxy for  

i projected another thought at the cowled master machines before me 
 how come you machines to be propelling these dark stars toward our
galaxy  

the mechanism s thought answer came   we took twenty dark stars in our
galaxy  fitted them with propulsion apparatus and other apparatus  and
then steered them out of our galaxy and across the gulf of space toward
this galaxy of yours  

 but why did you do it   i asked   what have you come to our galaxy
for  

the machine s thought answer came like a thunder clap 

 we have come for suns  

 for suns  what do you mean  

the mechanism explained   our galaxy is much older than yours  a large
number of its suns are old  red  dying  the worlds of our dying suns
have been growing colder and colder  upon many of them even we machines
can no longer exist  we wish to get some new suns to replace the dying
ones in our galaxy  we saw across space that your galaxy has many hot 
young suns  and we have come to get some of them  

we were stupefied   you are mad   i said finally   how could you hope
to move suns from our galaxy to yours  

 we can do it quite simply   the machine affirmed   these dark stars
can be propelled anywhere we wish and we need only approach a sun with
one of them  project toward that sun a powerful attraction beam such as
we are equipped to produce  and then head our dark star back toward our
galaxy dragging the sun with us  

i heard with increasing stupefaction   and you ve come with these
twenty dark stars to rob us of twenty of our suns  

 it s impossible   jhul din exclaimed   not these machines or any one
else could ever tow away suns like that  

 it s not impossible   said korus kan tensely   they can do it if they
have such equipment as they say  

 we can do it  yes  and we mean to do it   the machine affirmed 
 already we approach your galaxy  and when we reach it each of our dark
stars will attach itself to a sun and we will start back with these
twenty suns toward our galaxy  we will return again for another twenty
suns and will continue this until our galaxy has sufficient hot  young
suns to keep all our worlds warm 

 if you do not oppose us  no one in your galaxy will be harmed and
we will allow the worlds of the suns we choose time enough to be
evacuated of their inhabitants  but if you do oppose us  you will find
it useless  for we machines are mighty and no mere living creatures can
hope to resist us  you will only sacrifice yourselves in attempting
resistance  

 illustration   we machines are mighty  you will only sacrifice
yourselves in attempting resistance   

the cold  logical statement of the machine stung me to fury   do you
imagine for a moment that we are going to allow you to come out of
space and rob us of our suns at will   i cried 

the mechanism s reply was completely unimpassioned   you will gain
nothing by resistance   it repeated   when we have taken what suns we
need  you will still have thousands of suns left  

 you ll take no suns at all from our galaxy   i answered   you ll find
that we are not such powerless creatures as you machines imagine  

the cowled machine ignored my threat   you will return to your galaxy  
it told me   and will tell your peoples what we have said  make clear
to them that if they do not resist us  no one will be harmed when we
take the suns we need  but tell them also that if any of them oppose us
we will annihilate them  

a burning resentment at this mechanical thing s cold arrogance welled
in me  but i retained enough reason to choke it down 

 we are free to go  then   i asked 

 you are commanded to go   the mechanism answered   you are ordered to
take that message to your galaxy s peoples  

 very well  we will go   i answered  to our followers i said   back to
the cruiser  

                                        

we strode across the circle with the hosts of machines around it still
motionless  watching  as coolly as possible we entered the ship and
slammed shut the space door  i climbed with my two officers to the
bridge room 

 ascend at once   i ordered jan allon 

the generators hummed and our craft rose rapidly from the dark star s
surface  around us rose the flying mechanisms  too 

 they re seeing us off to make sure we don t attempt any attack   i
said   these machines leave nothing to chance  

 dur nal  what will come of all this   cried jhul din as our cruiser
rose   can those mechanical things actually steal suns from our galaxy  

 they can do it unless we are able to stop them   i said thoughtfully 
 and whether or not we shall be able to stop them  i don t know  

 why  if we gather all the patrol together we ought to be able to beam
them and their cursed dark stars out of space   jhul din exclaimed 

 we ll do our best  anyway   i said grimly 

 the flying mechanisms are dropping back  sir   reported jan allon 

we had risen high above the onrushing dark stars  and the machines that
had accompanied us were now descending 

in a short time we were millions of miles above the twenty dead suns 
and we soon made contact with our squadron  which had been hovering
overhead 

 we return toward the galaxy at full speed immediately   i ordered the
ships of our squadron 

as our ships put on speed we soon left the dark stars behind us 
outracing them toward the galaxy 

i took the space phone and after a little difficulty got through to
headquarters at canopus  in a few moments i was talking to the chief 

lacq larus listened with utmost attention as i related what we
had discovered concerning the dark stars and the purposes of the
machine things guiding them 

 this is almost incredible   replied lacq larus  voice when i had
finished   cosmic buccaneers coming from another galaxy to steal suns
from our own galaxy  

 it is incredible but true   i told him   they will reach our galaxy
within a short time and will start dragging away suns  

 you believe that they can do this  dur nal   he asked 

 i am almost sure that they can   i answered   these machines impressed
me as being the most formidable creatures i ve ever encountered  korus
kan is of my opinion also  

 well  we re not going to stand tamely by and let them rob us of any
of our suns   said lacq larus  a steely quality in his voice   dur nal 
when you reach the galaxy s edge stand by there with your squadron
and keep watch for the coming of these dark stars  i ll call up every
cruiser in the interstellar patrol and order them to rendezvous off
betelgeuse  we ll join up with you there to combat these machines and
their worlds  

 one more thing  sir   i added quickly   what if we are unable to
prevent these machines from taking twenty of our suns  

 you don t think they will prove too strong for us  do you   lacq larus
asked 

 i have been strongly impressed by the powers of these mechanisms   i
answered   i suggest that the worlds of all suns in that section at the
galaxy s edge be evacuated of their inhabitants so that if the suns are
taken  the inhabitants will be safe  

after a moment s silence he said   very well  dur nal  i ll give orders
for the evacuation to take place  

                                        

during the next hours our squadron raced at top speed toward the
galaxy s edge  the dark stars faded from sight behind us  but we knew
that they were still there  still rushing steadily on toward our galaxy 

by the time we reached betelgeuse the whole galaxy was aflame with news
of the coming of these cosmic corsairs  who meant to plunder us of part
of our suns  despite this excitement there was no panic 

lacq larus was on his way from canopus with the thousand cruisers of
the interstellar patrol that had been at headquarters  and in response
to his commands  flashed across the whole galaxy  every fighting ship
in the patrol was making for betelgeuse 

yes  from every part of the galaxy they were coming  those lean 
long hawks of space  from the great trade routes between the bigger
suns  from lonely regions in uncharted parts of the galaxy  rushing
at reckless speed through the perils of the void  the ships of the
interstellar patrol came in answer to their chief s call 

meanwhile all the worlds of the suns in the threatened section at
the galaxy s edge were being swiftly evacuated of their inhabitants 
interstellar liners and freighters in hundreds of thousands swarmed
from those worlds to suns back in the galaxy  carrying their whole
populations to suns and worlds more safe 

out beside great betelgeuse  at the galaxy s very edge  i lay waiting
with my squadron  my ships still maintained their triangular formation 
we had climbed several light years above the plane of the threatened
suns and now lay in the void  jhul din and korus kan and i watching
intently through our instruments as the dark stars in the outer void
rushed toward us  nearer and nearer they came  still flying on in a
compact group 

 they re beginning to slow down   muttered jhul din  watching   if lacq
larus and the rest of the patrol don t show up soon  they ll be too
late  

 here they come now   exclaimed korus kan 

we turned and saw racing toward us thousands on thousands of shining
points that became cruisers as they neared us  foremost among them flew
the flagship of lacq larus  and the chief s craft drew up close beside
our own 

 almost the whole strength of the patrol is here  dur nal   lacq larus
told me on the space phone   what about the dark stars  

 they re almost here too   i said grimly   you can see them out there  

there was silence as lacq larus and all the rest in our fleet peered
toward those twenty onrushing giant globes 

 they re almost here  sir   i said   what are your orders for attack  

 we ll divide into twenty divisions  one to attack each of those
dark stars   lacq larus ordered   each division will descend on its
objective and beam everything upon it as heavily as possible  trying
especially to destroy the controls of the propulsion apparatus  

 we will not attack until they actually start dragging away suns  for
if they find themselves unable to seize any of our suns as they plan 
they will no doubt return to their own galaxy and there will be no need
of combat  

we watched  therefore  without making a move as the score of dark stars
drew nearer 

the scene was a thrilling one  the hosts of the galaxy s shining suns
stretching away behind us  the myriad cruisers of our great fleet lying
motionless up there high above the outermost suns  the twenty huge
black stars booming nearer on their ruthless mission of intergalactic
piracy 

the dark stars were now at the galaxy s edge  and there they separated 
each of them moved toward one of the suns below  and each selected a
hot  youthful sun of large or medium size  directly under my own ship
we could see one of the dark stars approaching a blue sun  curving
smoothly in toward it 

 it can t be done   jhul din exclaimed tautly   nothing can drag a sun
away  

 but they re doing it   cried korus kan   look at that  

the dark star had come very close to the blue sun  and now from its
surface a broad  pale beam of immense magnitude stabbed toward the sun 

for a few moments they remained thus  dark star and sun connected
by that beam  then the dark star began to move slowly away under the
influence of its propulsion apparatus  and the blue sun moved slowly
after it 

 they re doing it   repeated korus kan   they re towing that sun away  

 and look  all the other dark stars are dragging away suns   cried the
astounded jhul din 

                                        

it was an astounding  an awful spectacle  those robber dark stars of
the machines making away with twenty of our suns 

lacq larus  voice snapped at that moment from the space phone  our
fleet divided into twenty subdivisions  each with one of the dark stars
as its objective  then came the order to attack 

down  down  like swooping hawks of space our cruisers rushed headlong
down through the millions of miles toward the dark stars towing away
their helpless prey  and up from each of the dark stars to meet us 
as though they had only been awaiting our attack  darted hosts of the
disk like flying mechanisms 

there was a hell of cosmic struggle then over the twenty dark stars  so
appalling was the inferno of that battle that i lost all sense of the
individual part our ship took in it 

i was aware of jhul din and korus kan yelling hoarsely beside me as
the beams of our ships stabbed and smashed through the masses of the
darting flying machines  then i saw brilliant filaments of blue force
emitted from the flying mechanisms toward our cruisers  saw every
cruiser touched by them explode instantly into blue light  ships and
flying mechanisms went to death by hundreds in space all around us  our
cruisers still strove to smash down through the machines to the surface
of the dark stars  for even while this wild combat went on above them 
the dark stars were still steadily towing their captive suns on out
into space 

the flying mechanisms outnumbered us two to one  and despite our wild
efforts we could not get through them to the worlds beneath  and more
and more of our ships were exploding in azure light as the filaments of
force found a mark 

three quarters of our force had been destroyed and it looked as though
the rest of us would be wiped out in a few minutes  when there came an
order from the chief 

 all ships break off fighting and ascend   ordered lacq larus 

what cruisers were left us at once disengaged from the struggle and
darted upward 

the flying mechanisms pursued us but we beamed them so savagely from
above that they dropped back 

we climbed two light years before lacq larus gave our shattered forces
the order to halt and resume formation 

 the machines have destroyed all but a quarter of our ships   he said 
 they outnumber us  and to continue the battle is only to invite
complete destruction  

 but  sir  we can t let them take those twenty suns away   cried one of
the captains on the space phone 

 i m afraid we ll have to this time   lacq larus said   but they will
be coming back for more suns  and the next time we will be ready for
them  

 but  sir      protested another officer  and was cut short by the
chief s grim voice 

 i know how you of the patrol feel at thus letting them take those suns
away  but we can do no good by sacrificing ourselves at this time  and
must have all the forces available to meet them when they come again 
we will return into the galaxy  except for two scouting divisions
which will remain and keep watch along the edge  

grimly  with bitter thoughts  our shattered forces moved back into the
galaxy  leaving the patrolling force behind 

 beaten   jhul din exclaimed unbelievingly   the interstellar patrol 
beaten by those machines  

 we re not completely beaten  jhul din   i told him   they ve won the
first round  but when they come back again it will be a different
story  

 but we ve let them take twenty of our suns away from us   he said   as
easily as though we weren t there at all  

                                        

when our remaining forces re entered the galaxy we found it in uproar 
news of the success of the machine corsairs in robbing us of twenty
suns had already flashed everywhere across it  it was known that the
machines would return for more suns  and in view of what had happened
it seemed probable that they could loot our galaxy of as many suns as
they wished 

lacq larus broadcast a statement to allay the general fear 

 the machines greatly outnumbered our forces and for that reason we
were unable to prevent them from towing away twenty suns   he stated 
 but they will without doubt return to plunder us of more suns  and
before then we must construct as many ships as possible with which to
meet them  if we have forces enough we should be able to prevent the
theft of any more suns  

preparations were begun almost at once to build up sufficient forces to
meet the cosmic corsairs on their return  thousands on thousands of new
patrol cruisers were hastily laid down to replace those destroyed in
the battle  beams of greater range and power were installed in them 

it was estimated that we would have twice as many ships to meet the
next coming of the corsairs as when we first had combated them  we
would be meeting them on something like even terms as to numbers 

 by the suns  we ll blast them out of space when they show up next
time   jhul din vowed 

korus kan was not so sure   their weapons are more powerful than our
own   he reminded 

                                        

our new ships were hardly completed when there came warning of the
corsairs  return 

our astronomers had watched them closely as they towed our score of
suns steadily across the void toward their own distant galaxy  now the
astronomers reported that the twenty dark stars were on their way back
to our galaxy 

lacq larus ordered a patrol far out into space in the direction of the
oncoming corsairs  our main forces remained just inside the galaxy s
edge  all worlds of suns there had been evacuated 

soon came word from the patrol that the dark stars were close  lacq
larus ordered our scouts not to engage but to keep just ahead of them 

again jhul din and korus kan and i looked down from a great height
at the oncoming dead suns of the buccaneering machines  they swept
steadily  purposefully  toward our galaxy s edge again  but this time
lacq larus did not wait for them to attach themselves to suns  he
ordered the attack at once 

if our first battle with the machines had been wild  our second one was
madness  the flying mechanisms still outnumbered our ships slightly 
and they fought like the machines they were  with cold  relentless
purpose 

and as they fought with us  the dark stars on which they had come were
being directed smoothly toward our suns  hooking onto a sun each with
their great attraction beams  and starting again to tow these suns out
into the void 

at this sight  lacq larus flashed an order to us   try above all to get
down and cripple the propulsion apparatus of those dark stars  if we
don t  they ll get away with these suns too  

 they re getting away with them now   groaned jhul din   curse them  if
they were only living creatures instead of machines we might be able to
beat them  

already a third of our forces were gone  and at lacq larus  new order
we spent our ships at an appalling rate to wing down and disable the
dirigible dark stars 

it was in vain  the flying mechanisms kept always between us and the
dark stars below  and steadily as the wild battle raged above them 
those dark stars were dragging away their second capture of suns 

one only did our forces manage to disable  there had been a break in
the battle above it for a moment  and through that break two patrol
cruisers cometed down instantly and crashed deliberately into the
controls of that world  at once that dark star slowed and drifted
rudderless in space  circling aimlessly with the sun it had been towing
away  the machines deserted it and darted on to help protect the other
nineteen that were dragging their suns onward 

we followed those nineteen dark stars and their prey fiercely out
into space  never ceasing our attacks  two thirds of our force was
annihilated before lacq larus gave over the attack  the machines had
again had much the best of it and now outnumbered us by an even greater
margin 

his voice was heavy as he gave the order that signified our defeat 
 all ships return toward the galaxy  

we were silent as our remnant of ships returned 

 it s no good   said korus kan finally   the machines are stronger than
we are  and though we ll fight them when they come again  they ll take
our suns despite us  

 we ll stop them somehow   jhul din asserted   the patrol has met a lot
of enemies in its time and beaten them  and it will beat these cursed
mindless things of metal  

 i confess that i don t see how it can be done   i answered him   we ve
met them twice now and each time they ve defeated us  

lacq larus  voice came to me shortly on the space phone   dur nal  land
your ship on that disabled dark star   he said   i want to examine it
with you  

                                        

i gave the pilot the order and we detached ourselves from the rest of
the fleet and headed toward the dark star  it still drifted aimlessly
outside the galaxy s edge  it and the sun it had been towing away when
crippled now circling each other 

when we landed on it beside the ship of lacq larus and emerged in
space suits we found the dark star s surface held only some wrecks of
machines that had been shattered by our beams  no living or moving
machine was left upon that world 

lacq larus led toward the huge panel and levers the two down crashing
cruisers had wrecked   i want to examine the controls of this thing  
he said 

jhul din was looking at the fragments of machines around us with some
little satisfaction   at least some of them knew they met up with us  
he said 

we came to the shattered controls and examined them closely  korus kan
was especially interested 

 these dark stars are propelled by great generators of
propulsion vibrations  as i thought   he said   the beams they use to
pull suns away are simply attractive rays of immense power released
from a huge projector  

 so that s how they do it   lacq larus said   well  i m afraid it makes
small difference to us how they do it  as long as they continue to do
it  

but i clutched korus kan s arm  a sudden thought had entered my brain
with his words 

 korus kan  could the scientists of our galaxy duplicate this
propulsion apparatus and attractive beam   i cried 

he looked at me  puzzled   i suppose so  i don t see why not when the
principle is clear  

 and we could install them in dark stars just as the machines did   i
pressed 

 yes  that would not be hard  but why do you ask  dur nal  

 because i ve found a way to get back our stolen suns and whip those
machines once and for all   i cried 

 what do you mean  dur nal   asked lacq larus quickly 

swiftly i explained   suppose we take a hundred of the dark stars in
our galaxy and fit them with propulsion apparatus and attraction beams
like this one  then suppose we sail across space with those hundred
dark stars to the galaxy of the machines and     

 and take our suns back from them   cried korus kan  his eyes blazing 
 if we can do it     

 by the suns  we  can  do it   cried jhul din   it s a way to get back
our stolen suns and smash the machine people  

 dur nal  you may have found the right answer   lacq larus told me 
 the thing you propose is stupendous  but it seems to be the only
course open to us to win  

 we ll assemble all the scientists and workers in the galaxy if
necessary to get this done   he added 

within hours  the hastily summoned scientists of our galaxy had
pronounced our plan practicable  and preparations had begun 

swiftly cruisers of the interstellar patrol went forth and located a
hundred dark stars of the dimensions needed  there are hosts of such
dead suns booming along in the galaxy s spaces  and it was not hard to
find a hundred of suitable size 

meanwhile all the scientific ability of the galaxy had been thrown
into the manufacture of huge generators and propulsion and attractive
vibrations 

in an incredibly short time these were completed and transported to the
hundred selected dark stars  they were installed so that the dark stars
could be propelled in space at great speed in any direction  and could
fasten onto and tow any sun or body of stellar size  giant defensive
beam batteries were also installed 

when the first dark star was so equipped i gave it its tests  standing
with korus kan and jhul din at its controls  and with lacq larus
watching beside us  i turned on the power 

the huge dead sun moved away through space in perfect answer to its
controls  i speeded it up  slowed it  turned sharply and circled it
around a few suns to make sure of its tractability 

then we tried the attractive beam  korus kan handled the controls of
this  and with it we hooked onto a medium size sun  then as i started
our dark star forward through space again we found that we towed the
sun steadily along with us 

 it s successful   lacq larus exclaimed   and all the others will be
ready soon  

 as soon as they re ready we ll start for the galaxy of the machines  
he said   before they ve time to come back here again  

rapidly the others of the hundred dark stars were equipped and tested 
lacq larus took one as the flagship of the stupendous fleet 

at his order we drove our dark star chariot outside the galaxy s edge
and there the whole hundred massed together 

we formed in columns of ten  the dark star of lacq larus taking a
position a little ahead of the rest of us 

then lacq larus gave an order on the space phones which had been fitted
to all our worlds  and as one our fleet of a hundred dark stars began
to move through space toward the soft  hazy patch of light that was
the distant galaxy of the machines  our caravan was on its way to
retrieve our stolen suns  in the mightiest venture yet undertaken by
the interstellar patrol 

                                        

jhul din was exultant   by the suns  this is better than driving
ships   he exclaimed   driving dark stars to battle  

 there ll be all the battle you want when we reach the galaxy of the
machines   i told him grimly 

 you re going to follow out our original plan   i asked lacq larus on
the space phone  and he answered in the affirmative 

 it s a risky one  but i believe it is the best one  

we hurtled on in the void toward the distant galaxy of the machines 
slowly  very slowly despite our immense speed  it grew in apparent
size  it grew from a little patch of light to a cloud of tiny points of
light  and as it grew  our own galaxy shrank astern 

korus kan and jhul din and i relieved each other at the controls of the
dark star  we kept our place in the general formation  the dark star of
lacq larus still leading  there was something magnificent and awful in
this cosmic march of our hundred dead suns through space to retrieve
our stolen suns and take vengeance on those who had stolen them 

the galaxy of the machine people grew into a great cloud of stars
across the firmament  with eager eyes we surveyed it 

 it seems about the same size as our own galaxy   lacq larus commented 
 but it has far more dying suns than ours  

yes  as the machines had told us  this galaxy of theirs contained hosts
of dying suns  old  red and cold  they greatly outnumbered the suns
still hot with life  small wonder that the machines had sought for new 
young suns to replenish their waning universe 

 i see some of our own suns in there   korus kan exclaimed   the ones
they took from us  

 yes  i see them   lacq larus said   if all goes well  we ll soon be
taking them back  

as we neared the galaxy of the machines  lacq larus gave one hundred
dark stars their orders 

thirty nine of us were assigned to hook onto the stolen suns and
tow them back at once toward our own galaxy  the other sixty one 
including lacq larus  dark star and my own also  were to wreak all the
destruction in their power upon the machines  galaxy 

we drew steadily nearer and soon were very close to the galaxy ahead 
there was no sign that any of the machines in it were aware of our
approach 

 they can t have seen us coming   jhul din commented 

 they ve no idea we could come at all   i responded   they re probably
busy placing the last suns they took from us  our dark stars would be
hardly visible to them  

soon came the voice of lacq larus in final orders   we are now about to
enter this galaxy   he said   remember your duties and let nothing stop
you  

like rushing spheres of blackness our hundred dark stars raced into
the galaxy of the machines  once inside  we separated  the thirty nine
assigned to retrieve our thirty nine stolen suns sped directly  each
toward one of those suns  the rest of us darted forward on our dark
stars after the leading one of lacq larus 

our purpose was to destroy as many of that galaxy s suns as possible by
dragging them into one another  before the machines that peopled their
worlds were aware of our presence we had begun 

lacq larus drove his dark star toward a small white sun at that
galaxy s edge  hooked onto it with his attractive beam  and towed it
quickly toward a blue sun off to the left 

when near the blue sun he released the one he towed and it rushed on of
its own accord  crashed head on into the blue star  the two colliding
suns melted into a cloud of flame that whiffed away the worlds of both
of them in an instant 

while lacq larus was thus employed  the rest of us were not idle  i had
driven our own dark star toward a large red sun some distance inside 
and now i yelled for korus kan to hook onto it with our attractive
beam  he did so  and as i put on power we dragged the red sun after us
toward a double star not far from it 

we cast loose just before we reached the double star  i shot our dark
star past it  and the red sun  drifting after us  struck the twin
star squarely  the cosmic outrush of flame from that collision almost
reached our own hurtling world before we got out of reach 

                                        

off to one side three of our dark stars had seized another double star 
this one of huge dimensions  and were dragging it toward a great green
sun  and further in  one of our forces had got hold of an aged red sun
that was almost too big for it to handle  and was tugging it slowly
toward its doom 

all around us this stupendous process of wreckage was going on and we
were part of it  space inside that galaxy seemed filled with booming
dark stars and suns being dragged to flaming death  i glimpsed some of
the thirty nine of our force assigned to that duty seizing our stolen
suns and towing them toward outer space 

from the worlds of the suns we were destroying came clouds of
flying mechanisms rushing to attack us  but the giant beam batteries
installed on our dark stars blasted them out of space as they came
near  and still our smashing of suns went on 

jhul din and korus kan yelled with exultation as we towed still another
sun to collision and doom  i saw lacq larus  dark star some distance
away rapidly stripping the worlds from a sun and towing them into
another sun 

then korus kan cried out  pointed   look  the dark stars of the
machines  

i made out dim  huge shapes rushing toward us across that galaxy   the
machines  dark stars  

through the wild wreckage of crashing and flaring suns and worlds 
nineteen dark stars were bearing down on us  they were the dark stars
with which the machines had gone across space to steal our suns  now
they were rushing to battle us 

the scene that followed was beyond description  the machines meant to
stop our wrecking activities at any cost to themselves and they drove
their dark stars straight toward our own 

a half dozen of them crashed into that many of our dark stars in the
first rush  as they collided  dark star and dark star blazed up in hot
new life 

again and again they rushed at us headlong  as we dragged and wrecked
their suns  they never hesitated to collide with us  they fought with
magnificent  mindless courage to stop our wrecking activities 

but at last the last of them was gone  though more than twenty of our
own dark stars had been destroyed in the collisions that had ensued
when the machines rammed them  all space around us now seemed filled
with the wild flare of collided suns 

 all dark stars retreat back into space   came lacq larus  order   our
work here is finished  

 are all our own suns retrieved   i asked him on the space phone 

 yes  our other dark stars towed them out into space and they re all
clear  

quickly i turned my dark star and sent it booming with the others after
lacq larus  out of that ravaged galaxy 

outside in space waited the thirty nine dark stars that had retrieved
our thirty nine stolen suns 

 we got them all back   cried jhul din   didn t i tell you that we
would  that nothing could beat the patrol  

 head toward our own galaxy   lacq larus ordered   keep at half speed 
as those of us towing suns can t go so fast  

slowly  towing our thirty nine suns with us  we headed away through
space toward the dim light patch of our own galaxy 

looking back  we saw that the galaxy of the machines was lit in many
places by the flaring fire of collided suns 

we stared back for a long time at the stupendous damage which we had
done to that universe 

 it ll be a long time before  they  will come buccaneering again for
our suns   predicted jhul din 

 and if they ever do come again we can defeat them now that we have
powers equal to their own   i added   we d rather not war with the
machines nor with any one else  but we have fought for our suns  and as
long as the patrol lasts we are going to keep them
