preface 


the play of  hamlet  is above all others the most stupendous monument
of shakespeare s genius  standing as a beacon to command the wonder
and admiration of the world  and as a memorial to future generations 
that the mind of its author was moved by little less than inspiration 
 lear   with its sublime picture of human misery    othello   with its
harrowing overthrow of a nature great and amiable    macbeth   with
its fearful murder of a monarch  whose  virtues plead like angels
trumpet tongued against the deep damnation of his taking
off    severally exhibit  in the most pre eminent degree  all those
mighty elements which constitute the perfection of tragic art  the
grand  the pitiful  and the terrible   hamlet  is a history of mind  a
tragedy of thought  it contains the deepest philosophy  and most
profound wisdom  yet speaks the language of the heart  touching the
secret spring of every sense and feeling  here we have no ideal
exaltation of character  but life with its blended faults and
virtues   a gentle nature unstrung by passing events  and thus
rendered  out of tune and harsh  

the original story of hamlet is to be found in the latin pages of the
danish historian  saxo grammaticus  who died in the year      
towards the end of the sixteenth century  the french author  francis
de belleforest  introduced the fable into a collection of novels 
which were translated into english  and printed in a small quarto
black letter volume  under the title of the  historie of hamblett  
from which source shakespeare constructed the present tragedy 

saxo has placed his history about     years before christianity  when
barbarians  clothed in skins  peopled the shores of the baltic  the
poet  however  has so far modernised the subject as to make hamlet a
christian  and england tributary to the  sovereign majesty of
denmark   a date can therefore be easily fixed  and the costume of
the tenth and eleventh centuries may be selected for the purpose 
there are but few authentic records in existence  but these few
afford reason to believe that very slight difference existed between
the dress of the dane and that of the anglo saxon of the same period 

since its first representation  upwards of two centuries and a half
ago  no play has been acted so frequently  or commanded such
universal admiration  it draws within the sphere of its attraction
both the scholastic and the unlearned  it finds a response in every
breast  however high or however humble  by its colossal aid it exalts
the drama of england above that of every nation  past or present  it
is  indeed  the most marvellous creation of human intellect

act i 

scene i   elsinore  a platform before the castle  night 

  francisco  on his post  enter to him  bernardo  l h  

   ber   who s there 

   fran    r   nay  answer me     stand  and unfold    yourself 

   ber   long live the king    

   fran                     bernardo 

   ber                               he 

   fran   you come most carefully upon your hour 

   ber    tis now struck twelve  get thee to bed  francisco 

   fran   for this relief much thanks 

      crosses to  l  

                                       tis bitter cold 
  and i am sick at heart 

   ber   have you had quiet guard 

   fran                           not a mouse stirring 

   ber   well  good night 
  if you do meet horatio and marcellus 
  the rivals of my watch     bid them make haste 

   fran   i think i hear them   stand  ho  who s there 

   hor   friends to this ground 

   mar                          and liegemen to the dane    

     enter  horatio  and  marcellus  l h  

   fran   give you good night 

   mar                        o  farewell  honest soldier 
  who hath reliev d you 

   fran   bernardo hath my place 
  give you good night 

      exit  francisco  l h  

   mar           holloa  bernardo 

   ber                            say 
  what  is horatio there 

   hor     crosses to  c   a piece of him    

   ber    r   welcome  horatio  welcome  good marcellus 

   hor   what  has this thing appear d again to night 

   ber   i have seen nothing 

   mar    l   horatio says   tis but our fantasy 
  and will not let belief take hold of him 
  touching this dreaded sight  twice seen of us 
  therefore i have entreated him  along
  with us  to watch the minutes of this night    
  that  if again this apparition come 
  he may approve our eyes     and speak to it 

   hor   tush  tush   twill not appear 

   ber   come  let us once again assail your ears 
  that are so fortified against our story 
  what we two nights have seen    

   hor   well  let us hear bernardo speak of this 

   ber   last night of all 
  when yon same star that s westward from the pole
  had made his course to illume that part of heaven
  where now it burns  marcellus  and myself 
  the bell then beating one  

   mar   peace  break thee off  look  where it comes
  again 

     enter  ghost  l h  

   ber   in the same figure  like the king that s dead 

   hor   most like   it harrows me with fear and wonder     

   ber   it would be spoke to 

   mar   speak to it  horatio 

   hor   what art thou  that usurp st this time of night     
  together with that fair and warlike form
  in which the majesty of buried denmark
  did sometimes march  by heaven i charge thee  speak 

   mar   it is offended 

       ghost  crosses to  r  

   ber                  see  it stalks away 

   hor   stay   speak   speak  i charge thee  speak 

                            exit  ghost  r h  

   mar    tis gone  and will not answer 

   ber   how now  horatio  you tremble  and look pale 
  is not this something more than fantasy 
  what think you of it 

   hor   before heaven  i might not this believe 
  without the sensible and true avouch    
  of mine own eyes 

   mar             is it not like the king 

   hor   as thou art to thyself 
  such was the very armour he had on 
  when he the ambitious norway combated 

   mar   thus  twice before  and jump at this dead hour     
  with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch 

   hor   in what particular thought to work      i know not 
  but in the gross and scope     of mine opinion 
  this bodes some strange eruption to our state     
  in the most high and palmy     state of rome 
  a little ere the mightiest julius fell 
  the graves stood tenantless  and the sheeted dead
  did squeak and gibber in the roman streets 

     re enter  ghost  r h  

  but   l c   soft  behold  lo  where it comes again 
  i ll cross it  though it blast me 

     horatio  crosses in front of the  ghost  to  r 
    ghost  crosses to  l  

                                    stay  illusion 
  if thou hast any sound  or use of voice     
  speak to me 
  if there be any good thing to be done 
  that may to thee do ease  and grace to me 
  speak to me 
  if thou art privy to thy country s fate 
  which  happily  foreknowing may avoid 
  o  speak 
  o  if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
  extorted treasure in the womb of earth     
  for which  they say  you spirits oft walk in death 
  speak of it   stay  and speak 

      exit  ghost  l h  

   mar    tis gone 
  we do it wrong  being so majestical 
  to offer it the show of violence 

   ber   it was about to speak  when the cock crew 

   hor   and then it started like a guilty thing
  upon a fearful summons      i have heard 
  the cock  that is the trumpet of the morn 
  doth with his lofty     and shrill sounding throat
  awake the god of day  and  at his warning 
  whether in sea or fire  in earth or air 
  the extravagant and erring spirit     hies
  to his confine 
  but  look  the morn  in russet mantle clad 
  walks o er the dew of yon high eastern hill 
  break we our watch up  and  by my advice 
  let us impart what we have seen to night
  unto young hamlet  for  upon my life 
  this spirit  dumb to us  will speak to him

scene ii   a room of state in the palace 

     trumpet march  

     enter the  king  and  queen   preceded by  polonius  hamlet 
    laertes      lords  ladies   and  attendants 

   king    r c   though yet of hamlet our dear brother s death
  the memory be green      and that it us befitted
  to bear our hearts in grief  and our whole kingdom
  to be contracted in one brow of woe 
  yet so far hath discretion fought with nature 
  that we with wisest sorrow     think on him 
  together with remembrance of ourselves 
  therefore our sometime sister  now our queen 
  the imperial jointress of this warlike state 
  have we  as  twere with a defeated joy     
  taken to wife  nor have we herein barr d    
  your better wisdoms  which have freely gone
  with this affair along   for all  our thanks 
  and now  laertes  what s the news with you 
  you told us of some suit  what is t  laertes 

   laer    r                     my dread lord 
  your leave and favour     to return to france 
  from whence though willingly i came to denmark 
  to show my duty in your coronation 
  yet now  i must confess  that duty done 
  my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france 
  and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon 

   king   have you your father s leave  what says polonious 

   pol    r   he hath  my lord   wrung from me my slow leave
  by laboursome petition  and  at last 
  upon his will i sealed my hard consent      
  i do beseech you  give him leave to go 

   king   take thy fair hour  laertes  time be thine 
  and thy best graces spend it at thy will     
  but now  my cousin hamlet  and my son     

   ham    l   a little more than kin  and less than kind     

     aside  

   king   how is it that the clouds still hang on you 

   ham   not so  my lord  i am too much i the sun     

   queen   l c   good hamlet  cast thy nighted colour     off 
  and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark 
  do not for ever with thy vailed lids    
  seek for thy noble father in the dust 
  thou know st  tis common  all that live must die 
  passing through nature to eternity 

   ham   ay  madam  it is common 

   queen                            if it be 
  why seems it so particular with thee 

   ham   seems  madam  nay  it is  i know not seems 
   tis not alone my inky cloak  good mother 
  nor the dejected haviour of the visage 
  no  nor the fruitful river in the eye 
  together with all forms  modes  shows of grief 
  that can denote me truly  these  indeed  seem 
  for they are actions that a man might play 
  but i have that within which passeth show     
  these but the trappings     and the suits of woe 

   king    tis sweet and commendable in your nature  hamlet 
  to give these mourning duties to your father 
  but  you must know  your father lost a father 
  that father lost  lost his      and the survivor bound 
  in filial obligation  for some term
  to do obsequious sorrow      but to pers ver    
  in obstinate condolement      is a course
  of impious stubbornness   tis unmanly grief 
  it shows a will most incorrect to heaven     
  we pray you  throw to earth
  this unprevailing     woe  and think of us
  as of a father  for let the world take note 
  you are the most immediate to our throne 
  our chiefest courtier  cousin  and our son 

   queen   let not thy mother lose her prayers  hamlet 
  i pray thee  stay with us  go not to wittenberg 

   ham   i shall in all my best obey you  madam 

   king   why   tis a loving and a fair reply 
  be as ourself in denmark   madam  come 
  this gentle and unforc d accord of hamlet
  sits smiling to my heart      in grace whereof     
  no jocund health that denmark drinks to day     
  but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell 
  re speaking earthly thunder

  that he might not beteem     the winds of heaven

   laer    l c   my necessaries are embarked  farewell 
  and  sister  as the winds give benefit     
  let me hear from you 

   oph    r c          do you doubt that 

   laer   for hamlet  and the trifling of his favour     
  hold it a fashion  and a toy in blood 
  a violet in the youth of primy nature 
  forward  not permanent  sweet  not lasting 
  the p rfume and suppliance of a minute     

   oph   no more but so 

   laer   he may not  as unvalued persons do 
  carve for himself  for on his choice depends
  the safety and the health of the whole state 
  then weigh what loss your honour may sustain 
  if with too credent ear you list his songs 
  fear it  ophelia  fear it  my dear sister 
  and keep within the rear of your affection     
  out of the shot and danger of desire 
  the chariest maid     is prodigal enough 
  if she unmask her beauty to the moon 
  virtue itself scapes not calumnious strokes 
  be wary  then  best safety lies in fear 
  youth to itself rebels  though none else near 

   oph   i shall the effect of this good lesson keep 
  as watchman to my heart  but  good my brother 
  do not  as some ungracious pastors do 
  show me the steep and thorny way to heaven
  whilst  like a puff d and reckless libertine     
  himself the primrose path of dalliance treads 
  and recks not his own read     

   laer                        o  fear me not 
  i stay too long   but here my father comes 

     enter  polonius  l h

  the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail     
  and you are staid for  there   my blessing with you 

      laying his hand on  laertes   head   

  and these few precepts in thy memory  
  look thou char cter      give thy thoughts no tongue 
  nor any unproportion d thought     his act 
  be thou familiar  but by no means vulgar 
  the friends thou hast  and their adoption tried 
  grapple them to thy soul with hooks of steel 
  but do not dull thy palm with entertainment
  of each new hatch d  unfledg d comrade  beware
  of entrance to a quarrel  but being in 
  bear it  that the opposer may beware of thee 
  give every man thine ear  but few thy voice 
  take each man s censure      but reserve thy judgment 
  costly thy habit as thy purse can buy 
  but not express d in fancy  rich  not gaudy 
  for the apparel oft proclaims the man 
  and they in france of the best rank and station
  are most select and generous  chief in that     
  neither a borrower nor a lender be 
  for loan oft loses both itself and friend 
  and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry     
  this above all   to thine ownself be true 
  and it must follow  as the night the day 
  thou canst not then be false to any man 
  farewell  my blessing season this in thee     

   laer   most humbly do i take my leave  my lord

  of his affection to me

  that you have ta en these tenders for true pay 
  which are not sterling  tender yourself more dearly

  have burst their cerements      why the sepulchre 
  wherein we saw thee quietly in urn d 
  hath op d his ponderous and marble jaws

  that thou  dead corse  again  in c mplete steel 
  revisits thus the glimpses of the moon 
  making night hideous  and we fools of nature    
  so horridly to shake our disposition    
  with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls

  o  hamlet  what a falling off was there 
  from me  whose love was of that dignity 
  that it went hand in hand even with the vow
  i made to her in marriage  and to decline
  upon a wretch       whose natural gifts were poor
  to those of mine 
  but  soft  methinks i scent the morning air 
  brief let me be   sleeping within mine orchard 
  my custom always in the afternoon 
  upon my secure      hour thy uncle stole 
  with juice of cursed hebenon      in a vial 
  and in the porches of mine ears did pour
  the leperous distilment  whose effect
  holds such an enmity with blood of man 
  that  swift as quicksilver  it courses through
  the natural gates and alleys of the body 
  so did it mine 
  thus was i  sleeping  by a brother s hand
  of life  of crown  of queen  at once despatch d

   ghost   if thou hast nature in thee  bear it not 
  let not the royal bed of denmark be
  a couch for luxury      and damn d incest 
  but  howsoever thou pursu st this act 
  taint not thy mind  nor let thy soul contrive
  against thy mother aught  leave her to heaven 
  and to those thorns that in her bosom lodge 
  to prick and sting her  fare thee well at once

  and  gins to pale his ineffectual fire

     cousin   and less than  son   steevens remarks  that it seems to
    have been another proverbial phrase   the nearer we are in blood 
    the further we must be from love  the greater the  kindred  is 
    the less the  kindness  must be    kin  is still used in the
    midland counties for  cousin   and  kind  signifies  nature  
    hamlet may  therefore  mean that the relationship between them
    had become  unnatural

    his being sent for from his studies to be exposed at his uncle s

    much in the radiance of the king s presence  or  perhaps  an
    allusion to the proverb    out of heaven s blessing  into the
    warm sun    but it is not unlikely that a quibble is meant

   oph   o  my lord  my lord  i have been so affrighted 

   pol   with what  in the name of heaven 

   oph   my lord  as i was sewing in my closet 
  lord hamlet  with his doublet all unbrac d 
  pale as his shirt  his knees knocking each other 
  and with a look so piteous in purport 
  he comes before me 

   pol   mad for thy love 

   oph                       my lord  i do not know 
  but  truly  i do fear it 

   pol                   what said he 

   oph   he took me by the wrist  and held me hard 
  then goes he to the length of all his arm 
  and  with his other hand thus o er his brow 
  he falls to such perusal of my face
  as he would draw it  long staid he so 
  at last   a little shaking of mine arm 
  and thrice his head thus waving up and down 
  he rais d a sigh so piteous and profound 
  as it did seem to shatter all his bulk    
  and end his being  that done  he lets me go 
  and  with his head over his shoulder turn d 
  he seem d to find his way without his eyes 
  for out o doors he went without their helps 
  and  to the last  bended their light on me 

   pol   come  go with me  i will go seek the king 
  this is the very ecstacy of love    
  what  have you given him any hard words of late 

   oph   no  my good lord  but  as you did command 
  i did repel his letters  and denied
  his access to me 

   pol             that hath made him mad

   king    c   welcome  dear rosencrantz and guildenstern 
  moreover that we much did long to see you 
  the need we have to use you did provoke
  our hasty sending  something have you heard
  of hamlet s transformation  what it should be 
  more than his father s death  that thus hath put him
  so much from the understanding of himself    
  i cannot dream of  i entreat you both 
  that you vouchsafe your rest    here in our court
  some little time  so by your companies
  to draw him on to pleasures  and to gather 
  whether aught  to us unknown  afflicts him thus 
  that  open d  lies within our remedy 

   queen    r c   good gentlemen  he hath much talk d of you 
  and sure i am two men there are not living
  to whom he more adheres  if it will please you
  so to expend your time with us a while 
  your visitation shall receive such thanks
  as fits a king s remembrance 

   ros    r                    both your majesties
  might  by the sovereign power you have of us    
  put your dread pleasures more into command
  than to entreaty 

   guil    r       but we both obey 
  and here give up ourselves  in the full bent    
  to lay our service freely at your feet 

   king   thanks  rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern

   pol   now do i think  or else this brain of mine
  hunts not the trail of policy    so sure
  as it hath us d to do   that i have found
  the very cause of hamlet s lunacy 

   king    c   o  speak of that  that do i long to hear 

   pol    l c   my liege  and madam  to expostulate    
  what majesty should be  what duty is 
  why day is day  night night  and time is time 
  were nothing but to waste night  day  and time 
  therefore  since brevity is the soul of wit 
  and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes   
  i will be brief   your noble son is mad

  what is t  but to be nothing else but mad 
  but let that go

  that he is mad   tis true   tis true  tis pity 
  and pity  tis   tis true  a foolish figure 
  but farewell it  for i will use no art 
  mad let us grant him  then  and now remains
  that we find out the cause of this effect 
  or  rather say  the cause of this defect 
  for this effect defective comes by cause 
  thus it remains  and the remainder thus 
  perpend     
  i have a daughter  have  while she is mine 
  who  in her duty and obedience  mark

    believe it  adieu

  and more above      hath his solicitings     
  as they fell out by time  by means  and place 
  all given to my ear

  receiv d his love 

   pol   what do you think of me 

   king   as of a man faithful and honourable 

   pol   i would fain prove so  but what might you think 
  when i had seen this hot love on the wing
   as i perceived it  i must tell you that 
  before my daughter told me   what might you 
  or my dear majesty your queen here  think 
  if i had play d the desk or table book     
  or given my heart a winking  mute and dumb     
  or look d upon this love with idle sight     
  what might you think  no  i went round to work     
  and my young mistress thus did i bespeak 
   lord hamlet is a prince  out of thy sphere 
  this must not be   and then i precepts gave her 
  that she should lock herself from his resort 
  admit no messengers  receive no tokens 
  which done  she took the fruits of my advice     
  and he  repuls d  a short tale to make  
  fell into sadness  thence into a weakness 
  thence to a lightness  and  by this declension 
  into the madness wherein now he raves 
  and all we mourn for

mirth  forgone all custom of exercises  and  indeed  it goes so
heavily with my disposition  that this goodly frame  the earth  seems
to me a steril promontory  this most excellent canopy  the air  look
you  this brave o erhanging firmament  this majestical roof fretted
with golden fire  why  it appears no other thing to me than a foul
and pestilent congregation of vapours  what a piece of work is man 
how noble in reason  how infinite in faculties  in form and moving
how express     and admirable  in action how like an angel  in
apprehension how like a god  the beauty of the world  the paragon    
of animals  and yet  to me  what is this quintessence of dust  man
delights not me   nor woman neither  though by your smiling you seem
to say so 

 ros   my lord  there was no such stuff in my thoughts 

 ham   why did you laugh  then  when i said   man delights not me  

 ros   to think  my lord  if you delight not in man  what lenten
entertainment     the players shall receive from you  we coted them
on the way      and hither are they coming  to offer you service 

 ham   he that plays the king shall be welcome  his majesty shall
have tribute of me  the adventurous knight shall use his foil and
target  the lover shall not sigh gratis  the humorous man shall end
his part in peace      and the lady shall say her mind freely  or the
blank verse shall halt for t       what players are they 

 ros   even those you were wont to take such delight in  the
tragedians of the city 

 ham   how chances it  they travel      their residence  both in
reputation and profit  was better both ways  do they hold the same
estimation they did when i was in the city  are they so followed 

 ros   no  indeed  they are not 

 ham   it is not very strange  for my uncle is king of denmark     
and those that would make mouths at him     while my father lived 
give twenty  forty  fifty  an hundred ducats a piece for his picture
in little      there is something in this more than natural  if
philosophy could find it out 

    flourish of trumpets without

welcome  but my uncle father and aunt mother are deceived

 ham   i heard thee speak me a speech once   but it was never acted 
or  if it was  not above once  for the play  i remember  pleased not
the million   twas caviare to the general      but it was an
excellent play  well digested in the scenes  set down with as much
modesty as cunning      one speech in it i chiefly loved   twas
 neas  tale to dido  and thereabout of it especially  where he speaks
of priam s slaughter  if it live in your memory  begin at this line 
let me see  let me see

  striking too short at greeks  his antique sword 
  rebellious to his arm  lies where it falls 
  repugnant to command  unequal match d 
  pyrrhus at priam drives  in rage strikes wide 
  but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword    
  the unnerved father falls 
  but  as we often see  against some storm 
  a silence in the heavens  the rack     stand still 
  the bold wind speechless  and the orb below
  as hush as death  anon the dreadful thunder
  doth rend the region  so  after pyrrhus  pause 
  a roused vengeance sets him new a work 
  and never did the cyclops  hammers fall
  on mars s armour  forg d for proof eterne 
  with less remorse than pyrrhus  bleeding sword

soon   good  my lord  will you see the players well bestowed  do you

chronicles of the time  after your death you were better have a bad

  that he should weep for her  what would he do 
  had he the motive and the cue     for passion

  a scullion 
  fye upon t  fye  about  my brains      i have heard
  that guilty creatures  sitting at a play 
  have by the very cunning of the scene
  been struck so to the soul  that presently
  they have proclaim d their malefactions 
  for murder  though it have no tongue  will speak
  with most miraculous organ  i ll have these players
  play something like the murder of my father
  before mine uncle  i ll observe his looks 
  i ll tent him to the quick      if he do blench     
  i know my course  the spirit that i have seen
  may be the devil  and the devil hath power
  to assume a pleasing shape  yea  and  perhaps
  out of my weakness and my melancholy

act ii


     footnote ii     polonius    doctor johnson describes polonius as
     a man bred in courts  exercised in business  stored with
    observation  confident in his knowledge  proud of his eloquence 
    and declining into dotage  a man positive and confident  because
    he knows his mind was once strong  and knows not that it is
    become weak   the idea of dotage encroaching upon wisdom will
    solve all the phenomena of the character of polonius

       this must be known  which being kept close  might move
      more grief to hide than hate to utter love   

     i e    this must be made known to the king  for  being kept
    secret  the hiding hamlet s love might occasion more mischief to
    us from him and the queen  than the uttering or revealing of it
    will occasion hate and resentment from hamlet 

    it was the custom of shakespeare s age  to conclude acts and
    scenes with a couplet  a custom which was continued for nearly a
    century afterwards

    history of edward vi   says  katharine parre  queen dowager to
    king henry viii   was a woman  beautified  with many excellent
    virtues   the same expression is frequently used by other old
    authors  

     footnote ii      in her excellent white bosom    the ladies  in
    shakespeare s time  wore pockets in the front of their stays  

     footnote ii      these   c    in our poet s time  the word

     footnote ii      you are a fishmonger    this was an expression
    better understood in shakespeare s time than at present  and no
    doubt was relished by the audience of the globe theatre as
    applicable to the papists  who in queen elizabeth s time were
    esteemed enemies to the government  hence the proverbial phrase
    of  he s an honest man and eats no fish   to signify he s a
    friend to the government and a protestant  

     footnote ii      for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog 
    being a god  kissing carrion     have you a daughter     i e   
    hamlet having just remarked that honesty is very rare in the
    world  adds  that since there is so little virtue  since
    corruption abounds everywhere  and maggots are  bred  by the sun 
    which is a god  even in a dead dog  polonius ought to take care
    to prevent his daughter from walking in the sun  lest she should
    prove   a breeder of sinners    for though  conception 
     understanding  in general be a blessing  yet as ophelia might
    chance to  conceive   to be pregnant   it might be a calamity 
    hamlet s abrupt question    have you a daughter    is evidently
    intended to impress polonius with the belief of the prince s
    madness   malone  

     footnote ii      the satirical rogue   hamlet alludes to
    juvenal  who in his   th satire  describes the evils of long
    life  

     footnote ii      how pregnant his replies   big with meaning

     footnote ii      nay  then  i have an eye of you     i e    i
    have a glimpse of your meaning  hamlet s penetration having shown
    him that his two friends are set over him as spies  

     footnote ii      so shall my anticipation prevent your
    discovery  and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no
    feather    be beforehand with your discovery  and the plume and

    french origin  and was a common sporting term in shakespeare s
    time

     footnote ii      travel    become strollers  

     footnote ii      it is not very strange  for my uncle is king of
    denmark    this is a reflection on the mutability of fortune  and
    the variableness of man s mind  

     footnote ii      make mouths at him    i e    deride him by
    antic gestures and mockery  

     footnote ii      in little    in miniature  

     footnote ii      i know a hawk from a hern shaw    a hernshaw is
    a heron or hern   to know a hawk from a hernshaw  is an ancient
    proverb  sometimes corrupted into  handsaw   spencer quotes the
    proverb  as meaning   wise enough to know the hawk from its
    game   

     footnote ii      buz  buz    sir william blackstone states that
     buz  used to be an interjection at oxford when any one began a
    story that was generally known before  

     footnote ii      then came each actor on his ass    this seems
    to be a line of a ballad  

     footnote ii      seneca cannot be too heavy  nor plautus too
    light    an english translation of the tragedies of seneca was
    published in       and one comedy of plautus  viz   the
    menoechme  in       

     footnote ii      for the law of writ and the liberty  these are
    the only men    the probable meaning of this passage is    for
    the observance of the rules of the drama  while they take such
    liberties  as are allowable  they are the only men    writ  is an
    old word for  writing   

     footnote ii      as by lot  god wot    there was an old ballad
    entitled the song of jephthah  from which these lines are
    probably quotations  the story of jephthah was also one of the
    favourite subjects of ancient tapestry  

     footnote ii      the first row of the pious chanson   this
    expression does not appear to be very well understood  steevens
    tells us that the  pious chansons  were a kind of  christmas
    carols   containing some scriptural history thrown into loose
    rhymes  and sung about the streets  the  first row  appears to
    mean the  first division  of one of these  

     footnote ii      my abridgment comes    hamlet alludes to the
    players  whose approach will shorten his talk  

     footnote ii      thy face is valanced    i e    fringed with a
    beard  the valance is the fringes or drapery hanging round the
    tester of a bed  

     footnote ii      com st thou to beard me   to  beard  anciently
    meant to set  at defiance   hamlet having just told the player
    that his face is valanced  is playing upon the word  beard   

     footnote ii      by the altitude of a chopine    a chioppine is
    a high shoe  or rather clog  worn by the italians  venice was
    more famous for them than any other place  they are described as
    having been made of wood covered with coloured leather  and
    sometimes  even half a yard high   their altitude being
    proportioned to the rank of the lady  so that they could not walk
    without being supported  

     footnote ii      like french falconers    the french seem to
    have been the first and noblest falconers in the western part of
    europe  the french king sent over his falconers to show that
    sport to king james the first    see weldon s court of king
    james

     footnote ii      caviare to the general    caviare is the spawn
    of fish pickled  salted  and dried  it is imported from russia 
    and was considered in the time of shakespeare a new and
    fashionable luxury  not obtained or relished by the vulgar  and
    therefore used by him to signify anything above their
    comprehension  general is here used for the people  

     footnote ii      as much modesty as cunning    as much propriety
    and decorum as skill  

     footnote ii      falls with the whiff and wind of his fell
    sword   our author employs the same image in almost the same
    phrase 

            the grecians  fall
      even in the fan and wind of your fair sword

    apparently coined to suit a dreaming  stupid person  he seems to
    have been a well known character

   ros   madam  it so fell out  that certain players

  will so bestow ourselves  that  seeing  unseen

  your loneliness  we are oft to blame in this   
   tis too much prov d     that  with devotion s visage

   ham   to be  or not to be  that is the question    
  whether  tis nobler in the mind to suffer
  the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune 
  or to take arms against a sea of troubles    
  and  by opposing end them   to die   to sleep 
  no more   and by a sleep  to say we end
  the heart ache  and the thousand natural shocks
  that flesh is heir to   tis a consummation
  devoutly to be wished  to die   to sleep   
  to sleep  perchance to dream  ay  there s the rub 
  for in that sleep of death what dreams may come 
  when we have shuffled off this mortal coil     
  must give us pause      there s the respect    
  that makes calamity of so long life 
  for who would bear the whips and scorns of time     
  the oppressor s wrong  the proud man s contumely     
  the pangs of despised love  the law s delay 
  the insolence of office  and the spurns
  that patient merit of the unworthy takes 
  when he himself might his quietus make    
  with a bare bodkin      who would fardels bear     
  to groan and sweat under a weary life 
  but that the dread of something after death 
  the undiscovered country  from whose bourn    
  no traveller returns      puzzles the will 
  and makes us rather bear those ills we have
  than fly to others that we know not of 
  thus  conscience does make cowards of us all     
  and thus the native hue of resolution
  is sicklied o er with the pale cast of thought 
  and enterprises of great pith and moment     
  with this regard  their currents turn away 
  and lose the name of action

 ham   that if you be honest and fair  your honesty should admit no
discourse to your beauty     

 oph   could beauty  my lord  have better commerce than with honesty 

 ham   ay  truly  for the power of beauty will sooner transform
honesty from what it is to a bawd  than the force of honesty can
translate beauty into his likeness      this was some time a paradox 
but now the time gives it proof  i did love you once 

 oph   indeed  my lord  you made me believe so 

 ham   you should not have believed me  for virtue cannot so
inoculate our old stock  but we shall relish of it      i loved you
not

sinners  i am myself indifferent honest  but yet i could accuse me of
such things  that it were better my mother had not borne me  i am
very proud  revengeful  ambitious  with more offences at my beck    
than i have thoughts to put them in      imagination to give them
shape  or time to act them in  what should such fellows as i do 
crawling between earth and heaven  we are arrant knaves  all 
believe none of us  go thy ways to a nunnery  where s your father 

 oph   at home  my lord 

 ham   let the doors be shut upon him  that he may play the fool
nowhere but in s own house  farewell

 ham   if thou dost marry  i ll give thee this plague for thy dowry 
be thou as chaste as ice  as pure as snow  thou shalt not escape
calumny  get thee to a nunnery  farewell  or  if thou wilt needs
marry  marry a fool  for wise men know well enough what monsters you
make of them  to a nunnery  go  go  go 

 oph   heavenly powers  restore him 

 ham   i have heard of your paintings     too  well enough  heaven
hath given you one face  and you make yourselves another      you

at the first and now  was and is  to hold  as  twere  the mirror up
to nature  to show virtue her own feature  scorn her own image  and
the very age and body of the time its form and pressure      now

praise  and that highly  not to speak it profanely      that  neither

   ham                    ay  lady   twas my word

  thou wretched  rash  intruding fool  farewell 

      to the dead body of  polonius   behind the arras   

  i took thee for thy better 
  leave wringing of your hands  peace  sit you down 

      to the  queen  

  and let me wring your heart  for so i shall 
  if it be made of penetrable stuff 
  if damn d custom have not brazed it so      
  that it be proof and bulwark against sense

  in noise so rude against me 

   ham  

      seated  l c  

                              such an act 
  that blurs the grace and blush of modesty 
  calls virtue  hypocrite  takes off the rose
  from the fair forehead of an innocent love 
  and sets a blister there       makes marriage vows
  as false as dicer s oaths  o  such a deed
  as from the body of contraction plucks
  the very soul       and sweet religion makes
  a rhapsody of words   
  ah  me  that act 

   queen           ah me  what act 

   ham   look here  upon this picture  and on this 
  the counterfeit presentment      of two brothers 
  see  what a grace was seated on this brow 
  hyp rion s curls       the front of jove himself 
  an eye like mars  to threaten and command 
  a station like the herald mercury     
  new lighted on a heaven kissing hill 
  a combination  and a form  indeed 
  where every god did seem to set his seal 
  to give the world assurance of a man 
  this was your husband   look you now  what follows 
  here is your husband  like a mildew d ear 
  blasting his wholesome brother       have you eyes 
  could you on this fair mountain leave to feed 
  and batten on this moor       ha  have you eyes 
  you cannot call it love  for  at your age
  the hey day in the blood      is tame  it s humble 
  and waits upon the judgment  and what judgment
  would step from this to this 
  o shame  where is thy blush  rebellious hell 
  if thou canst mutine       in a matron s bones 
  to flaming youth let virtue be as wax 
  and melt in her own fire 

   queen   o  hamlet  speak no more 
  thou turn st mine eyes into my very soul 
  and there i see such black and grain d spots
  as will not leave their tinct      

   ham                               nay  but to live
  in the rank sweat of an enseamed bed          

   queen   o  speak to me no more 
  no more  sweet hamlet 

   ham                  a murderer and a villain 
  a slave that is not twentieth part the tythe
  of your precedent lord   a vice of kings      
  a cutpurse of the empire and the rule 
  that from a shelf the precious diadem stole 
  and put it in his pocket      

   queen                        no more

   queen   alas  how is t with you 
  that you do bend your eye on vacancy 
  and with the incorporal air do hold discourse 
  forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep 
  o gentle son

   ham   on him  on him   look you  how pale he glares 
  his form and cause conjoin d  preaching to stones 
  would make them capable       do not look upon me 
  lest with this piteous action  you convert
  my stern effects       then what i have to do
  will want true colour  tears perchance  for blood 

   queen   to whom do you speak this 

   ham                               do you see nothing there 

   queen   nothing at all  yet all that is  i see

     footnote iii    to be  or not to be  that is the question   
    hamlet is deliberating whether he should continue to live  or put
    an end to his existence  

     footnote iii     or to take arms against a sea of troubles     a
    sea of troubles  among the greeks grew into a proverbial usage 
    so that the expression figuratively means  the troubles of human
    life  which flow in upon us  and encompass us round like a sea  

     footnote iii      this mortal coil    coil is here used in each

     footnote iii      no traveller returns    the traveller whom
    hamlet had seen  though he appeared in the same habit which he
    had worn in his life time  was nothing but a shadow 
     invulnerable as the air   and  consequently   incorporeal   the
    ghost has given us no account of the region from whence he came 
    being  as he himself informed us   forbid to tell the secrets of
    his prison house    malone

    admit no discourse to your beauty     i e    if you really
    possess these qualities  chastity and beauty  and mean to support
    the character of both  your honesty should be so chary of your
    beauty  as not to suffer a thing so fragile to entertain
    discourse  or to be parleyed with

    best suited to her purpose

     footnote iii      i have heard of your paintings    these
    destructive aids of beauty seem  in the time of shakespeare  to
    have been general objects of satire  

     footnote iii      heaven hath given you one face  and you make
    yourselves another     i e    heaven hath given you one face  and
    you disfigure his image by making yourself another  

     footnote iii      you jig  you amble  and you lisp    this is an
    allusion to the manners of the age  which shakespeare  in the
    spirit of his contemporaries  means here to satirise  

     footnote iii      make your wantonness your ignorance    you
    mistake by  wanton  affectation  and pretend to mistake by
     ignorance

     footnote iii      to a nunnery  go  exit hamlet    there is no
    doubt that hamlet s attachment to ophelia is ardent and sincere 
    but he treats her with apparent severity because he is aware that
    ophelia has been purposely thrown in his way  that spies are
    about them  and that it is necessary for the preservation of his
    life  to assume a conduct which he thought would be attributed to
    madness only

     footnote iii      robustious perrywig pated fellow   this is a
    ridicule on the quantity of false hair worn in shakespeare s
    time  for wigs were not in common use till the reign of charles
    the second   robustious  means making an extravagant show of
    passion  

     footnote iii      the ears of the groundlings    the meaner
    people appear to have occupied the pit of the theatre  which had
    neither floor nor benches in shakespeare s time   as they now sit
    in the upper gallery  

     footnote iii      o er doing termagant    the crusaders  and
    those who celebrated them  confounded mahometans with pagans  and
    supposed mahomet  or mahound  to be one of their deities  and
    tervagant or termagant  another  this imaginary personage was
    introduced into our old plays and moralities  and represented as
    of a most violent character  so that a ranting actor might always
    appear to advantage in it  the word is now used for a scolding
    woman  

     footnote iii      it out herods herod    in all the old
    moralities and mysteries this personage was always represented as

    not made such men  but that they were only the handy work of
    god s assistants  

     footnote iii      indifferently   in a reasonable degree  

     footnote iii      speak no more them is set down for them   
    shakespeare alludes to a custom of his time  when the clown  or
    low comedian  as he would now be called  addressing the audience
    during the play  entered into a contest of raillery and sarcasm
    with such spectators as chose to engage with him

    that according to the doctrine of the four humours   desire  and
     confidence  were seated in the blood  and judgment in the
    phlegm  and the due mixture of the humours made a perfect
    character

     footnote iii      lying down at ophelia s feet    to lie at the
    feet of a mistress during any dramatic representation  seems to
    have been a common act of gallantry  

     footnote iii      jig maker    writer of ludicrous interludes 
     a jig  was not in shakespeare s time only a dance  but a
    ludicrous dialogue in metre  many historical ballads were also
    called  jigs   

     footnote iii      for i ll have a suit of sables    wherever his
    scene might be  the customs of his country were ever in
    shakespeare s thoughts  a suit trimmed with sables was in our
    author s own time the richest dress worn by men in england  by
    the statute of apparel     henry viii   c        article
    furres    it is ordained  that none under the degree of an  earl

    are supposed to behold what passes in the acts of a tragedy  and
    sing their sentiments between the acts 

    the use to which shakespeare converted the chorus  may be seen in
    king henry v

act v 

scene i   a church yard 


   enter two  clowns      with spades   c    l h u e  

  st clo    r   is she to be buried in christian burial that wilfully
seeks her own salvation 

  nd clo    l   i tell thee she is  therefore make her grave
straight     the crowner    hath set on her  and finds it christian
burial 

  st clo   how can that be  unless she drowned herself in her own
defence 

  nd clo   why   tis found so 

  st clo   it must be  se offendendo      it cannot be else  for here
lies the point  if i drown myself wittingly  it argues an act  and an
act hath three branches  it is  to act  to do  and to perform    
argal     she drowned herself wittingly 

  nd clo   nay  but hear you  goodman delver    

  st clo   give me leave  here lies the water  good  here stands the
man  good  if the man go to this water  and drown himself  it is 
will he  nill he  he goes     mark you that  but if the water come
to him and drown him  he drowns not himself  argal  he that is not
guilty of his own death shortens not his own life 

  nd clo   but is this law 

  st clo   ay  marry is t  crowner s quest law    

  nd clo   will you ha  the truth on t  if this had not been a
gentlewoman  she should have been buried out of christian burial 

  st clo   why  there thou say st      and the more pity that great
folks should have countenance in this world to drown or hang
themselves  more than their even christian      come  my spade  there
is no ancient gentlemen but gardeners  ditchers  and grave makers 
they hold up adam s profession 

  nd clo   was he a gentleman     

  st clo   he was the first that ever bore arms  i ll put another
question to thee  if thou answerest me not to the purpose  confess
thyself        

  nd clo   go to 

  st clo   what is he that builds stronger than either the mason  the
shipwright  or the carpenter 

  nd clo   the gallows maker  for that frame outlives a thousand
tenants 

  st clo   i like thy wit well  in good faith  the gallows does well 
but how does it well  it does well to those that do ill  now  thou
dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church  argal 
the gallows may do well to thee  to t again  come 

  nd clo   who builds stronger than a mason  a shipwright  or a
carpenter 

  st clo   ay  tell me that  and unyoke     

  nd clo   marry  now i can tell 

  st clo   to t 

  nd clo   mass  i cannot tell 

  st clo   cudgel thy brains no more about it      for your dull ass
will not mend his pace with beating  and  when you are asked this
question next  say  a grave maker  the houses that he makes  last

     to contract  o  the time  for  ah  my behove

     as if i had never been such

 ham   that skull had a tongue in it  and could sing once  how the
knave jowls it to the ground  as if it were cain s jaw bone  that did
the first murder  this might be the pate of a politician  which this
ass now o er reaches  one that would circumvent heaven  might it not 

 hor   it might  my lord

 ham   there s another  why may not that be the skull of a lawyer 
where be his quiddits now  his quillets      his cases  his tenures 
and his tricks  why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him
about the sconce     with a dirty shovel  and will not tell him of
his action of battery  i will speak to this fellow   whose grave s

 ham   how absolute the knave is      we must speak by the card     
or equivocation will undo us 

    to  horatio  r  

how long hast thou been a grave maker 

  st clo   of all the days i the year  i came to t that day that our
last king hamlet overcame fortinbras 

 ham   how long s that since 

  st clo   cannot you tell that  every fool can tell that  it was the
very day that young hamlet was born      he that is mad  and sent
into england

  st clo   why  because he was mad  he shall recover his wits there 
or  if he do not   tis no great matter there

 ham   upon what ground 

  st clo   why  here in denmark  i have been sexton here  man and
boy  thirty years 

 ham   how long will a man lie i the earth ere he rot 

  st clo    faith  if he be not rotten before he die  he will last
you some eight year or nine year  a tanner will last you nine year 

 ham   why he more than another 

  st clo   why  sir  his hide is so tanned with his trade  that he
will keep out water a great while  and your water is a sore decayer
of your ill begotten dead body  here s a skull now  hath lain in the
earth three and twenty years

jest  of most excellent fancy  he hath borne me on his back a
thousand times  here hung those lips that i have kissed i know not
how oft  and now  how abhorred in my imagination it is  where be your

    gives the skull to horatio  who returns it to the grave digger   

 hor   e en so  my lord 

 ham   to what base uses may we return  horatio  why may not
imagination trace the noble dust of alexander  till it find it
stopping a bung hole 

 hor    twere to consider too curiously      to consider so 

 ham   no  faith  not a jot  but to follow him thither with modesty
enough  and likelihood to lead it  as thus  alexander died  alexander
was buried  alexander returneth to dust  the dust is earth  of earth
we make loam  and why of that loam  whereto he was converted  might
they not stop a beer barrel 

  imperial c sar      dead and turn d to clay 
  might stop a hole to keep the wind away 
  o  that the earth  which kept the world in awe 
  should patch a wall to expel the winter s flaw     

  but soft  but soft  aside  here comes the king 
  the queen  the courtiers  who is this they follow 
  and with such maim d rites      this doth betoken

 osr   nay  good my lord  for mine ease  in good faith      sir  here
is newly come to court laertes  believe me  an absolute gentleman 
full of most excellent differences  of very soft society and great
showing      indeed  to speak feelingly of him      he is the card or
calendar of gentry      for you shall find in him the continent of
what part a gentleman would see     

 ham   what imports the nomination of this gentleman     

 osr   of laertes 

 ham   of him  sir 

 osr   sir  you are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is  

 ham   i dare not confess that  lest i should compare with him in
excellence  but  to know a man well  were to know himself     

 osr   i mean  sir  for his weapon 

 ham   what is his weapon 

 osr   rapier and dagger 

 ham   that s two of his weapons  but  well 

 osr   the king  sir  hath wagered with him six barbary horses 
against the which he has imponed      as i take it  six french
rapiers and poignards  with their assigns  as girdle  hangers      or
so  three of the carriages  in faith  are very dear to fancy  very
responsive to the hilts  most delicate carriages  and of very liberal
conceit     

 ham   what call you the carriages 

 osr   the carriages  sir  are the hangers 

 ham   the phrase would be more german     to the matter  if we could
carry cannon by our sides 

 osr   the king  sir  hath laid  that in a dozen passes between
yourself and him  he shall not exceed you three hits  and it would
come to immediate trial  if your lordship would vouchsafe the
answer     

 ham   how if i answer no     

 osr   i mean  my lord  the opposition of your person in trial 

 ham   sir  it is the breathing time of day with me  let the foils be
brought  the gentleman willing  and the king hold his purpose  i will
win for him if i can  if not  i will gain nothing but my shame and
the odd hits 

 osr   shall i deliver you so 

 ham   to this effect  sir  after what flourish your nature will 

 osr   i commend my duty to your lordship    exit   l h  

 hor    r   you will lose this wager  my lord 

 ham    c   i do not think so  since he went into france  i have been
in continual practice  i shall win at the odds      but thou wouldst
not think how ill all s here about my heart  but it is no matter 

 hor   nay  good my lord 

 ham   it is but foolery  but it is such a kind of gain giving     
as would  perhaps  trouble a woman 

 hor   if your mind dislike any thing  obey it      i will forestall
their repair hither  and say  you are not fit 

 ham   not a whit  we defy augury  there is a special providence in
the fall of a sparrow
