kitchen his good old red white and blue face stretched long instead of wide in its usual grin that he had brought some bad news with him a slump in the cattle market moonshine liquor discovered again down in the outfit s quarters a delayed shipment of groceries from salt lake i who in the months that were coming was to live through more shock and fright and distress and disaster than should fall to the lot of a thousand women in all of their combined lifetimes was worrying then for fear we should have to be doing without olive oil and canned mushrooms for a few weeks in the ranch house i had a letter to day he said from the canneziano twins i am like a lot of folks who say that they are not superstitious who just happen to think that it is bad luck to walk under a ladder more than likely the shivery creepy sensation i felt when sam said that was due to the cold he had brought in with him and was not due to the fact that those words of his were the forerunners for all of the grim mysteries and the tragedies that made the desert moon ranch before the end of july a place of horror how much do they want i questioned no mary they want to come here to live lands alive for how long danielle wrote the letter she says they want to come here and rest indefinitely there was quite a bit in it about the peace of the deserts and the high mountains here in nevada she says she longs for it with all her soul or something like that danielle i said always was the best of the two you going to let them come sam anything else for me to do not a thing for you there d be plenty for others those girls are no kin of yours let me see they must be able bodied young women by now eight years old when they were here in makes them twenty four years old now according to my figures why a couple of women twins aggregating forty eight years should decide to come here and rest their souls at your expense is beyond me i have plenty so has henry ford why don t they go rest their souls with him they ve got as much claim on him as they have on you none i reckon where are they now anyway switzerland lands alive i don t pretend to know much about foreign geography but i ve understood that there were a few mountains in switzerland leave those girls rest their souls right there where they are sam no i don t know mary i guess i ll write them a letter and tell them to come along lots of room i didn t argue any more about it for twenty five years i had been housekeeper of the desert moon ranch house and i had learned during that time that there was only one subject concerning sam or the place on which i could never hope to have any say so trying to argue with sam about anything that had to do in any way with margarita ditsie when she was margarita ditsie stanley or when she was margarita ditsie canneziano was about as sensible as hoisting a chiffon parasol for protection in the midst of one of our nevada mountain cloudbursts margarita ditsie was of french canadian parentage a dark haired big eyed beauty her father kept a gambling hole in esmeralda county in the early days her mother had run away from a convent after she had become a nun to marry him the girl had some of the nun some of the runaway and some of the gambling house proprietor in her it made a queer combination when she was eighteen years old she came from carson to visit lily trooper over on the three bars ranch in northeastern nevada about sixty miles from here sam met her there at one of ben trooper s big barbecues she and sam were married two weeks later she was a lot younger than sam but even then he was the richest man in the valley with every unwedded woman for a hundred miles around setting her cap for him whether margarita married him for his wealth or whether it was to spite the other girls who would have liked to marry him i don t know all i know is that margarita never had a mite of love for him she stayed with him though and acted decently enough for two years until dan canneziano came to the ranch and got a job on it as cowpuncher it was during those two years that sam built this ranch house for her he had an architect in new york draw the plans for it and though now on the outside with its towers and trimmings it looks kind of old fashioned i think it is still the finest house in nevada sam s lead and silver mine had just come in and there was not anything from italian marble fireplaces to teakwood floors that was too grand for what margarita called the stanley mansion she left it all the elegance and the luxury and she broke her marriage vows for love of this wop cowpuncher that i guess is fair and full enough description of margarita canneziano i don t blame her i quit blaming folks for things a good many years ago when after firing three chinese cooks in six weeks i decided that if we were to live healthy and wholesome i d have to take over the job of cooking as well as housekeeping for the desert moon ranch and set about it and learned to cook in other words when i became a creator myself i got to know creations and so quit blaming all of them if i forget to put the soda in the sour milk pancakes it isn t their fault if they don t rise they are as i made them margarita was as the lord made her he i suppose either had his own good reasons for turning out such a mess or else he was tired or flustered or maybe was just experimenting on the road to something better when he did it i should explain i suppose wishing to be as honest as possible in spite of the fact that i am writing a mystery story that canneziano was different from the ordinary breed of cowpunchers his father he claimed had some hifaluting title in italy before he got into a peck of honorable patriotic trouble and had to skip to the united states to save his neck that may be true and it may not canneziano had a good education he talked poetry and played the violin margarita heard him playing down in the outfit s quarters one day and had sam invite him up to the house to play she accompanied him on the grand piano that sam had bought for her before long dan canneziano was spending a good part of his time at the ranch house sam being nobody s fool soon saw how the land lay but he according to his custom then and now kept his mouth shut and his eyes open sure enough one evening they tried to elope together sam went after them and brought them back i remember yet how the three of them looked coming into the house that night margarita her head high defiant but pretty as a fire s flame canneziano slinking in at her heels like a whipped cur expecting worse and sam following behind them calm as cold turkey the three of them had about half an hour s talk together then sam herded canneziano down to the outfit s quarters and i suppose told the men to keep him there for there he stayed until sam was ready for him again the next morning sam started to the county seat he reached there that evening the following morning he got his divorce he came back to the desert moon on the third morning with his divorce and with a preacher he sent for canneziano and stood by while the preacher married margarita stanley to daniel canneziano decent and regular according to the laws of nevada there it should have ended it didn t because sam never got over loving margarita i don t hold that to his credit i see no more virtue in keeping on loving a person who has proved unworthy of being loved than i see in hating a person who has turned out to be blameless or in continuing to do any other unreasonable thing at any rate sam did it so when nine years later she came back to the desert moon with twin girls danielle and gabrielle and said that canneziano had deserted her and the children sam took them all right in i don t know yet whether or not they took him in certainly he did not show much surprise when in about ten days canneziano put in an appearance sam allowed him to get a good start with his threats and then he took him across his knees and gave him a sound spanking and passed him over to margarita to dry his tears and washed his own hands and went fishing that evening he had one of the men hitch up and take the whole kit and caboodle of cannezianos to rattail in time to catch the east bound train i am ashamed to say that sam gave them money i don t know how much i shouldn t be surprised if it was more than they had expected to get from their blackmailing scheme a tidy sum i ll be bound for shortly after we heard that canneziano had opened the finest gambling house south of the mason and dixon line in new orleans sam wanted to keep the children he offered to adopt them margarita would not consider it but several times after that pale yellow perfumed letters came to the desert moon and sam answered those letters with a check me he answered each time with it is for the little girls mary i can t let little girls go needing when margarita died in france seven years after she had paid us her blackmailing visit sam the ninny wrote to canneziano and again offered to adopt the girls and give them a good home on the desert moon he got a few insulting insinuating lines for an answer canneziano had his own plans for his daughters who had developed into rare beauties he would thank sam to keep his hands off mind his own business and so forth it would have made a milder man than sam stanley fighting mad sam went around all that day swearing to me that he was through that he had made his last offer of help to the canneziano family had sent his last contribution i know for certain though that he sent five hundred dollars to gabrielle after that in answer to a letter she wrote to him but if sam was soft with the women he was not soft with canneziano he had showed up here beaming and broke about three years ago he had left suddenly after having seen sam and no one else less beaming but quite as broke as he had been when he had come i thought maybe sam was forgetting that side of the family and that this might be a good time to remind him is canneziano planning to come on later too and rest i asked just at present he is in san quentin serving a three years term danielle didn t say for what deviltry his term s up this summer that is another reason the girls want to come here somewhere safe from his persecutions i think the letter said poor little girls sam went on i reckon we haven t any idea of what they ve been through all these years i reckon not i agreed but they aren t little girls any more seems queer to me with all the beauty their father was bragging about that neither of them has married twenty four is getting along i ll bet sam answered it is because they have never had any decent opportunities you know how pretty they were as little girls and how good danielle was good enough i said gabrielle was a holy terror sam let that pass considering he continued the life that they ve had to lead and all i think it speaks pretty well for them that they have come through straight and clean instead of asking him how he knew that i said you d be willing then to have john marry one of them john sam s adopted son was the apple of sam s eye he would have the ranch and sam s fortune other dependents provided for when sam died whether or not the girl he married would be contented to live on the ranch and help john carry it on and keep up its traditions making it one of the proudest spots in nevada was a mighty important thing to sam he waited so long before answering my question that i was sure i had hit the nail on the head john he finally said is old enough to take care of himself with that he turned and went out of my kitchen not giving me a chance to say that though i had lived through fifty six years i had never yet seen a man at the age he had just mentioned i did not care i felt too vimless for even a spat with sam i knew that if these canneziano girls came to the desert moon they would bring trouble with them i was right a merciful providence be thanked that for a time at least the knowledge of how terribly right i was was spared me chapter ii john and martha i am not an admirer of men looking at most any man i find myself thinking what a pity it was he had to grow up since as a little helpless child he would have made a complete success sam stanley is different there is some of the child left in sam just as there is i think in any good man or woman a little seasoning of simplicity really is all it amounts to but there is a quality about sam that makes a person feel that he set out early in life to follow the recipe for being a man and that he has made a thorough job of it physically alone sam would make about three of most men with plenty left over for gravy but it is not that it is the something that makes him stroll up unarmed to a cowpuncher who is bragging wild with moonshine and clinking with firearms and say in that drawling gentle voice of his what s the trouble here son and the something that makes that cowpuncher get polite first and evaporate immediately after and sam whiteheaded now at that why he as a young man with a pretty fair education and a tidy sum of money left him by his father who had been a well thought of lawyer in massachusetts should come out here to nevada take up his homestead land and settle content for the rest of his life has always been more or less of a mystery to me i will warn you though that it is a mystery that doesn t get solved in this story unless you care to take sam s explanation of it he says that when his father died it left him without a relative whom he knew of in the world he was twenty years old and he owned a set of roving toes and an imagination so he went to california seeking romance and gold finding neither he took a small boat named the indiana and went up to oregon where he joined a friend of his named tom cone who had a place on the columbia river near rooster rock one day sam was out in the woods he said there was nothing to be out in except woods or rain in oregon in those days and he heard a noise behind a thicket he thought tom who lived for practical jokes was getting ready to pull one so sam crept up to the thicket stooping low and making no noise and shouted boo at the biggest bear he had ever seen in his life sam says he has forgotten what the bear said he decided then and there that the oregon forests were no place for a man with no more sense than he had he left them and came down here to nevada no forests no fences no folks and a free view for ten thousand miles is the way sam puts it so i stayed it was the first place i d ever found where i didn t feel hampered for room he staked out his hundred and sixty acres with boulder creek tumbling and roaring through them he built his cabin out of railroad ties in a grove of quaking aspen trees he hired help and built fences and dug ditches and planted crops and bought stock he bought more land he hired more help dug more ditches planted bigger crops bought more stock he has been doing that regularly ever since and of course he located the lead and silver mine on his property that made him millions if it made him a cent before it played out but in spite of the money that old lady luck as he called his mine made for him sam never gave his heart to it it was the desert moon ranch that he loved and the money he made from it that he was proud of that was why when the honor of the ranch went under during those terrible weeks last summer sam all but went under with it after margarita left the place from her visit of taking the twins with her sam went around for a week or two with his head cocked to one side as if he was listening for something i knew what he was missing and i was not surprised when one day he told me he had decided to send to san francisco and get a couple of children and adopt them he wrote to a big hospital in san francisco and got in touch with a trained nurse who would be willing to come up and live on the ranch and take care of the two children he had her go to an orphan s home and select the children and bring them with her when she came sam s specifications concerning them were that they were to be a boy and a girl under ten and over five years old healthy american and brown eyed sam s own eyes are the color of ball bluing giving his face with his red cheeks and his white beard the patriotic effect i have mentioned the nurse came early in september with the two brown eyed children named vera and alvin sam at once re named them john he said was the only name for a boy and mary the only name for a girl but since my name was mary he would let the little girl have martha which meant according to sam boss of the ranch the nurse s name was mrs ollie ricker if you can imagine a blue eyed pink cheeked yellow haired bisque doll turned old you will have a good idea of her appearance at that time i don t know how old she was then i don t know how old she is now younger by many years than i am i am sure and yet she has always seemed old to me old with the sudden but inevitable oldness of a wrecked ship or a burned down house or a felled tree that makes a body forget that a year ago or perhaps only yesterday it was a fresh new thing she never talked i do not mean that she never chatted or gossiped i mean that she never said one word not good morning nor good night nor if you please nor thank you if she could possibly avoid it at the end of sixteen years of daily association with mrs ricker that is up to the time of the second murder on the desert moon i knew exactly as much about her past life as you know at this minute john at that time was nine years old he was as bright and as upstanding and as handsome as any little fellow to be found anywhere bashful at first but ready and glad to be friendly with an uplifting smile that wrinkled his short nose and that would wheedle a cooky out of a pickle jar i may as well say now that this description of john at nine years old is as good a description as i can give of john at twenty five if you will draw his height up to six feet and put on weight accordingly martha when she came to us was a frail white faced mite with enormous brown eyes that looked as if they had been removed from a jersey heifer and set in her white face the papers from the orphanage gave her age as five years but even i who knew less about children than it was decent for any woman to know soon saw that something was wrong she walked well enough but she could scarcely talk at all her ways and her habits were those of a two year old infant yet she was far too large for that age before she had been with us a week i knew that martha was not quite right in her mind mrs ricker knew it too her excuse was that she had chosen martha because she was so pretty that she had had no opportunity to judge her other characteristics she insisted that she thought with proper care martha would develop normally i knew better sam knew it too but when i begged and besought him not to adopt her he brought out an argument good and conclusive for him if i don t adopt her and take care of her said sam who the heck would so adopt her he did and he spent a small fortune on doctors specialists for her none of them could do anything it was they said a hopeless case of retarded development so at twenty one years of age martha though the care and doctoring had given her a fine healthy body had the mind of a child of five or six years not too bright a child either that was at best at worst well no matter entirely harmless the doctors said but i always had my doubts sam tried all sorts of teachers for her too bringing them from back east and paying them sums to stagger but in the end we found that mrs ricker was better with her than anyone else she never pretended any particular love for martha but she took care of her and kept her sweet and clean and put up with her tempers when many a better woman than ollie ricker would have gone away in disgust i am not saying that if there is a judgment day as many say and some believe i d care to be standing in ollie ricker s shoes if she is wearing them at that time but i do say that her gentleness and her patience through all those years with martha should be counted to her credit whether or no chapter iii hubert hand it was three years after mrs ricker came to the ranch bringing john and martha that hubert hand put in his appearance he had got mr indian chat chin as everybody called him to bring him up from rattail in his old surrey hubert hand was something of a dude in those days though he has well outgrown it since and i remember yet how comical he looked sitting up there so stiff and fine in his light gray overcoat and gray fedora hat with that big roman nose of his protruding out and up disdainfully above his little moustache and apparently above all consciousness of dirty old mr indian chat chin and the rattle trap rig mr indian chat chin stopped his old nag at the entrance to the driveway and hubert hand climbed carefully down and came up the road swinging a walking cane like he was leading a parade sam and i as was our custom went walking down to meet him he took off his hat to me and said to sam i wish to see the owner of this ranch nobody ever mistook me for a fairy before sam said but go ahead your first wish is granted what are the other two hubert hand got out his card then besides his name it had clover blossom creamery and the san francisco address printed on it now mr stanley hubert hand went on after the embarrassing minute of general introductions i am going to be honest with you hold on stranger sam interrupted you re not you are going to be as dishonest as heck otherwise you wouldn t bother to tell me you were going to be honest go ahead hubert hand laughed but he didn t like it he went ahead though and explained that he had an up and coming creamery business in san francisco but that his physician had told him that he had to live in a high dry climate with plenty of sunshine and no fog he had after inquiries and investigations decided that the desert moon ranch altitude seven thousand feet sunshine three hundred and sixty five days in the year to say nothing of the marvelous view of the garnet mountains the hunting the fishing and the pure snow water would fill all his requirements thanks sam said when i get ready to start a gold cure sanatorium i ll drop you a line you won t do business then hubert hand questioned i hadn t heard anything about doing business sam said hubert hand s proposition was that he start a creamery on the desert moon ranch and supply the valley with ice cream butter and other dairy products sam had the ranch the cows and the big ice plant mr hubert hand had the knowledge and the equipment they could divide the profits next to sheep men i guess there is nothing that cow men hold in lower contempt than they hold dairy farms sam was too much disgusted to swear very long but do you realize mr stanley hubert hand insisted that this entire valley has to depend on salt lake city or on reno for its dairy products listen stranger sam said i wouldn t turn the desert moon into a place to slop milk around in if the entire valley had to depend on hong kong china for its ice cream cones forget it and come in now and have some supper to my knowledge hubert hand from that day to this has never again mentioned on the desert moon anything that had to do with creameries neither from that day to this has he been off the ranch for more than a couple of weeks at a time by the way he began trying to make it sound unimportant when we had finished supper i heard in telko that you were something of a chess player i am when i can get a game sam said but chess players in these parts are as scarce as hen s teeth my neighbor thirty miles east of here and i used to play regular two nights a week but the son of a gun struck it rich and like most loyal native sons of this state he moved to california to spend his money i m teaching my boy john but he is just a kid here lately about all i ve done is work out the puzzles by myself i play a little hubert hand produced right modestly sam jumped up and got out his chess table inlaid ebony and ivory made special and his ebony and ivory chess men hubert hand beat him the first game in about half an hour they set up their men again it took hubert hand over an hour that time to beat sam but he did it heck sam said at the end of that game you re hired hired for what for whatever you want to call it except the slopping of milk around send for your trunk and name your pay why didn t you say in the first place that you were a blankety blank crack chess player i realize right here that i am not going to be able to get through with this entire story with sam in it and continue to modify his vocabulary into hecks and blankety blanks wrong i think it is but it is true that men out here do not talk like that sam cusses swears and damns just as naturally and as innocently as he breathes the only real trouble about sam s profanity is that he uses up all his strong words day by day in ordinary conversation so when occasions arise that call for something really emphatic sam hasn t any words to do them justice if the demands are not too serious he reverts and finds a little pshaw or shoot unusual enough to meet the need if it goes beyond that he opens his mouth in silence and keeps it open hoping for a word until his pipe drops out and scatters ashes and burned and burning tobacco all over everything i pay no attention to his profanity and small attention to his pshaws and shoots but when his pipe drops i get right down interested to return to hubert hand he accepted sam s offer then and there the next day he titled himself assistant ranch manager and named his salary at two hundred and fifty dollars a month sam paid it without blinking and kept right on managing the ranch and everything on it except perhaps myself without any assistance the same as he had always done chapter iv chadwick caufield chadwick caufield the other member of our household who was present on the desert moon ranch at the time of the first murder came only two years ago last october it was away past bedtime after ten o clock but the radio was brand new then and we were all sitting up listening to a fine program given by the hoot owls in portland oregon when the doorbell rang sam answered it chad stepped in he was wearing white corduroy trousers a long yellow rubber raincoat and a straw hat tethered to its buttonhole with a string he was carrying a ukulele under his arm and a camera in his hand he took off his hat displaying a head full of pretty yellow curls he smiled displaying a sweet gentle disposition if there is any better index to character than the way a person smiles i have never found it how do you do he said i have come to visit you by the time sam got his pipe picked up john had got down the forty feet length of living room and had chad by both hands and was introducing him as the friend he had told us about the friend he had made at mather s field during the war the way of that was john had saved his life for him down there and had never since been able to get out from under the responsibility of it john had found a job for him after the armistice and when chad lost it john had loaned him money to start out in a vaudeville act he did fine with that for three years and was making good money on the orpheum circuit when he got into an automobile accident in kansas city and was laid up for months in the hospital there he went back to work sooner than he should have and spent three months in an oakland hospital with influenza john had wired money to him there and had asked him again to come for a visit to the desert moon but since he had had a standing invitation for years and since he had sent no word that he was coming john was as much surprised as any of us that evening he had walked over he explained from winnemucca a distance of a couple of hundred miles he had had money to buy a ticket no further than winnemucca he had had a job there for a while dish washing a fine job he made of it i ll warrant and had used his earnings to get into a solo game hoping to win enough money to pay for his ticket he had lost his money his watch his coat vest and shirt the landlady at winnemucca he said wanted his trunk worse than he did and anyway he never argued with ladies she had allowed him to take the raincoat a raincoat in this part of nevada being about as much use to anybody as a life preserver to a trout and the funny straw hat he had worn both in his vaudeville act and the ukulele who wouldn t be glad to let anyone who wanted to take a ukulele anywhere take it the camera he had found on the road between shoshone and palisade he had named it unconscious sweetness and called it connie for short and he was always plum daffy about it taking expected and unexpected pictures of all of us at all hours and in all places and pasting them in big albums with jokes and such written underneath it is hard to give a fair description of chad he was a little pindling fellow around sam and john and hubert hand he looked about as dainty and trifling as the garnish around the platter of the thanksgiving turkey he seemed kind of like that too like the extra bit of garnishing that makes life s platter prettier and nicer absolutely useless maybe but never cluttery until after he came i had not realized how little real laughing any of us had done we had been happy enough and content but we had never been much amused he amused us he made us laugh he took the mechanical player off the old grand piano and played it as we had never before heard it played he spoke pieces and sang funny songs until we held our sides with laughing he was a ventriloquist and a mimic besides he could imitate all of our voices to a t he had been with us about a week before any of us knew that i was in the kitchen one day when i heard someone come into the butler s pantry mary sam s voice called from there you are fired bounced you haven t made a cake in two days nor doughnuts in three you are getting too lazy and worthless for the desert moon i tottered but just before i fainted clear away here came that grinning little ape dancing and kicking his heels in an airy fairy dance but still speaking in that gentle drawling voice of sam s i laughed until i had to sit down and lean on the table i begged him then not to give it away for a few days and the fun he and i had for the next week would make a book in itself martha adored him he played with her by the hour he made two dolls mike and pat for her and he would let them sit on her knees while he made them talk for her he had to treat her as he would treat a child of course but he managed what the rest of us did not always manage to treat her as if she were a good sensible child not too young to be polite to chad had the nicest manners of any man i have ever known at the end of november when he began to talk about leaving sam offered him a hundred and fifty a month to stay on he said like hubert hand had said what for for living sam said chad laughed and shook his head double it then sam urged i wouldn t have you leave the place and martha for three hundred a month so why shouldn t i pay it to have you stay chad never would take any regular money from sam but he stayed on and got what he needed such as clothes and razor blades and films for connie and had them charged to sam s accounts he called himself the perpetual guest p g for short but some of the others said it stood for pollyanna gush and called him polly to twit him pollyanna may not be literature i don t know but a person of that nature is most uncommonly pleasant to have around the house the only time i ever felt any differently about chad was right after sam broke the news to the assembled household that we were to be visited by a couple of lady twins from switzerland chad began then to practise a new song about sleep little baby and to permit the most ear splitting sounds to issue from the back of his throat he called it yodeling and said that yodeling was switzerland s chief export and that he was practising up to make the ladies feel at home i declare it nearly drove me out of my wits a disturbing element they were you see from the very first chapter v the arrival the girls got here on friday the eighth of may sam and i rode down to rattail in the sedan to meet them and john took the small truck down to bring up their baggage number twenty came roaring up on time and stopped with a snort of angry protest as it always does when it has to stop at rattail which is not often not more than a dozen times a year at best i guess sam and i hurried down the tracks to where the porter s white rapidly swinging arms were piling up the shining black baggage i don t know what there is about riding in a train that turns folks haughty and supercilious but there is something that does a person who would be right hearty and human on his own two feet sits in a car window and looks out at the platform people as if they were something he wanted to be careful not to step in by the time i had passed fifty or more windows and had reached where the girls were standing i was so heated up i couldn t find a word to say but pleased to meet you which was not the truth one of them smiled real sweet and said mary upon my soul you haven t changed at all in sixteen years and made as if to kiss me which i did at once the other one gave me a jerky nod and stood there watching the train pull out until sam who had been poking along behind me managed to catch up uncle sam she exclaimed laughing and standing on tiptoe and putting her hands on his shoulders and tipping her pointed chin up to him you dear to have us i had always remembered that you were the biggest man in the world and now i see that i was right about it sam didn t kiss her as she had expected him to he patted her hands took them down off his shoulders and held them a minute before he dropped them and reached to shake hands with the twin who had kissed me well now he said this is sure great little girls all grown up to ladies and coming to see their old uncle he had bitten on that uncle bait though he was no more their uncle than i was which of you is which now let s get you sorted out so i can call you by name i used to get you all mixed up when you were little tykes couldn t tell one from the other you won t have that trouble any more said the one who had nodded at me i am gabrielle and that prim little puss is danielle people never get confused about us any longer indeed i should think not danielle was dressed pretty and neat in a suit of gray about the shade of a maltese cat with a nice little round hat to match and not more than ten inches of gray silk stocking showing between the edge of her skirt and the tops of her neat gray pumps gabrielle had on a floppy coat thing that looked more like a bathrobe cut off at the knees the way it lopped and draped with nothing but a big buckle on one hip to hold it together at all it was about two shades darker than good cream tomato soup her hat was as near as she could match it i guess and though it was small it was soft and loppy her stockings sixteen inches of them in sight if an inch were a kind of sickly cross between yellow and pink her black satin shoes had stilt heels and silver buckles she wore also a pair of earrings dangling almost to her shoulders that looked like the spinners the boys use here in the fall when they go after the big trout the population of rattail had come running to the depot of course when the train stopped and at last swaggering his way among males females indians cowpunchers and dogs here came john he doesn t usually trim his walk with that swagger but bashful as an overfed coyote he is hard put to it at times to cover up this deficiency of his so he swings his shoulders and talks loudly and boasts around when a person with a keen ear could hear his knees clicking together la la exclaimed gabrielle when she caught sight of him who is this picturesque man thing coming toward us john did look pretty fine wearing his new corduroy suit and his shining new leather puttees and his new sixteen dollar sombrero he had even gone so far as to button up the collar of his brown flannel shirt i was sorry he had not been around when the train came in to add tone to sam and to me he sam answered beaming with pride is my boy john how thrilling chirped gabrielle it is like living in a cinema isn t it danny and off she went sort of skipping along the tracks to meet him when they met john gave her about the same attention that a passenger gives the ticket chopper at the gate in a city depot when he sees the train he is trying to catch moving slowly out through the yards he pulled off his hat with a bow but he passed her walking very fast i thought that he was so flustered that he did not know what he was doing he knew he was headed straight for danny he had been in the freight house since long before the train came in sizing up from a safe distance the girls arrival then he had sneaked out the back way up past the station house and around it and back again to give the appearance of having just that minute got into rattail john i said when he reached danny and me and stopped short like he had just been lassoed from the rear this is danielle canneziano john dropped his hat in the alkali dust his new hat and reached out and took both of danny s hands in his falling on his knees in front of her would not have been much showier i he produced i i heard you laugh to me it barely made sense but she seemed to find it interesting and important really she said and sort of trilled it full of meaning standing there with my new shoes hurting my corns and sam and gabrielle completely out of sight around the corner of the depot i felt as necessary useful and welcome as a hair in the soup and a sight more conspicuous rattail s population was beginning to close in around us i pulled at john s sleeve but i declare if a freight hadn t come along forcing those two to get off the tracks they might have been standing there yet gazing into each other s eyes i was halfway home riding beside danny in the sedan when gabrielle s laughing out again at some remark of sam s made me remember that she had been the only one who had done any laughing when we had met danny had only smiled so if that laugh was what had put john clear off his head he had picked the wrong twin chapter vi the secret the first minute i heard that the canneziano girls were coming to the desert moon i was certain that they were not coming for the peace of the mountains and the deserts going on from there i questioned myself as to what reason any canneziano had ever had for coming to the ranch or for writing to the ranch the answer was to get money i tried to think that they would stay a few months long enough to put themselves in sam s good graces ask him for a tidy sum and leave but they had not been on the place two days before i knew that though that might be a minor part of their plan it was not the major part that there was something far less simple something probably treacherous and sinister at the root of this visit of theirs to the desert moon on the evening of their arrival the girls had unpacked their trunks in their bedrooms the next morning the boys carried their trunks to the attic going through the upper hall later that same morning i saw one of the empty drawers that had fitted into their new fangled trunks lying beside the door to the attic stairway i hate clutter i picked it up and carried it upstairs i went in all good faith but i wear rubber soled shoes around the house and the stairs are thickly carpeted so the girls who were up there did not hear me coming just before i got to the turn in the stairs i heard one of them say i am sure that there is no use in searching the house in the first place he never could have gotten it into the house without being seen you are too sure of everything when you are unsure of anything the other girl answered and i thought since the voice was louder and somehow richer that it was gaby s stop being sure and try being sensible we must find it we have very little time how do you know whether he could have brought it into the house or not there is a back stairway fool that i was i kept right on going up the stairs it took me a while to develop the poll prying eavesdropping sneaking and generally despicable character that i did develop later did you girls lose something i asked when my head had poked up to where i could see them danny jumped from being startled but gaby never turned a hair only a trinket of dan s she said possibly she never packed it at all i gave them the trunk drawer and came back downstairs wracking my brain with questions who was the he who had or who had not gotten something into the house the something that they must find and had very little time in which to find it and land s alive what was the something i resolved to say nothing but to watch those two girls like a hawk from then on i did so but it was three weeks before i heard anything more at all though i saw a great deal i saw those girls searching searching everlastingly the entire place i saw them go to the cabin and stay inside of it for hours i saw them in the barnyards and in the barns searching i saw them down in the outfit s quarters when the men were all away i heard them get up late at night and sneak out of the house and come back in the early hours of the morning and once or twice i thought that i saw them seeing me as i watched them and then i was afraid it was during these three weeks that danny and john announced their engagement my own opinion is that they got themselves engaged the first five minutes they were alone together but that they had gumption enough to wait for ten days before telling it sam gave them his blessing that is to say he said that any agreement they wanted to make was all right with him if danny was sure she would be satisfied to live on the desert moon and if they would wait a year to be married they agreed to this the year of waiting reluctantly sam whose one bad habit not counting his pipe is using suitable and unsuitable quotations on all suitable and unsuitable occasions assured them that a year was as a day on the desert moon but that didn t seem to make them any happier the only people who were downright pleased with sam s decision were gaby and myself i for certain reasons of my own gaby because she was choosing to consider herself also in love with john i realize that this is crowding pretty fast what the books call love interest i realize too that i have not given any description of john that would account for two traveled ladies coming to the desert moon and at once falling in love with him he had as i guess i ve signified a heap more than his share of masculine good looks outside of hat and collar advertisements i don t know that i ve ever seen even pictures of men that were any better looking than john was the way he lived and dressed and rode made him sort of romantic too i suppose a santa fe man who met him once when he was taking cattle back east for sam offered him a surprising salary to come to the grand canyon and live around there in order to impress and delight the eastern young lady tourists john was simple hearted and slow spoken but i guess most women don t mind that in men too he was a good boy all the way through and of course he had plenty of money now and would have a million or more not counting the ranch when sam died gaby made no bones about her feelings for john i did not do as john did and set all of her open advances toward him down to sister in lawly affection still i didn t believe that she really thought she was in love with john until i hid in the clothes closet that evening and heard danny and her talking together the closet arrangement was a fortunate one for my purposes it was between the girls rooms with heavily curtained doorways leading into each room and a door at the end with a transom for ventilation leading into the hall this closet had originally been a part of the hall going down between the two rooms but in when sam had had the ranch house remodeled inside they had turned the closet spaces for these rooms into two bathrooms necessitating the present arrangement of a double closet the dozens of gowns and frocks nothing so ordinary as mere dresses that the girls had brought with them hanging on padded hangers from the long rods made as good a hiding place as anyone could ask for especially since i always took care to unscrew the light globe in the closet when i went in so that it seemed to be all right but would not light when the wall switches were pressed i had gone in there so many evenings during the past three weeks and had heard nothing for my pains that it was a wonder i had decided to try it again that evening it was not luck though gaby s actions that evening toward john had been so downright disgusting sitting on the arm of his chair and trying to coax him out of the house to see the mountains by moonlight and hanging herself around his neck when they danced together and so on that i had a notion danny might have a little conversation ready for her when she could get her alone i had waited about ten minutes when i heard the door of gaby s room open i was so tickled i all but squealed when i heard that danny had come in with her instead of going on down the hall to her own room evidently they had begun their conversation in the hall for gaby s first words were jealous my dear dan i don t know but it is silly for you to act as you do john is in love with me since you are so certain of that why do you object to my poor little efforts i ve told you because they are silly and not kind why should you try to take him away from me when you don t want him yourself are you sure of that too yes i am his good looks fascinate you and so does his unsophistication you d like the fortune he is to inherit but you would never be satisfied to marry him and live right here for the remainder of your life no i would not i d marry him if he didn t have a penny it is you who are always thinking about his fortune but i wouldn t allow him to bury himself and his beauty and charm in this god forsaken country i d get him out into the world and have him take his place there with his ability and energy and with me to help him what a place it might be for you to have him is waste waste you don t know anything about love you ll never learn i i tell you i can t bear it it isn t fair she began to cry hollow sounding sobs that seemed to catch in her throat and wrench free from it gaby gaby dear please don t i am sorry waste waste waste you are not sorry don t touch me i am sorry gaby but what can i do i couldn t give john to you if i wished to you could give me a chance no i couldn t you are a coward perhaps i love him he means to me too peace and security and decent living the things i want most for my life why should i risk it all coward coward peace and security he means life to me all of it full and complete love and passion and adventure and attainment for him and for me too do you think i ll stand by and allow you to have him to bury his wonder in your peace and smother his possibilities with your security and decent living i think danny answered that you will have to john and i love each other and we are going to keep each other you nor anyone can change that suppose i should tell john why we came here you won t do that you can t harm me without harming yourself but if you threaten that just once more i will go straight to john and tell him the truth you promised i haven t broken my promise i shan t if you don t but you must know that i haven t any interest left in the thing what about your desire for revenge that desire was yours not mine i never considered that side of it at all coward quitter stool pigeon that isn t fair gaby i ll help if i can i have been helping haven t i i won t hinder in any way but the time is short now remember that danny there was a new tone in gaby s voice sweet like and appealing i did not trust it for a minute but i think danny did for she answered gently yes dear forgive me let s be twinny again friends i could hear the treachery in that as plainly as i could hear the words i think danny did not hear it for she answered i do want to be friends gaby i do truly only please dear won t you leave my man alone and you ll help me and you won t tell him anything of course i won t tell gaby it is really your secret now not mine and i ll help you all i can chapter vii three rings revenge out of all that crazy conversation the one word kept pestering me like a leaking faucet no matter what i was doing or thinking that word revenge kept drip drip dripping until my mind was fairly drenched with it i got all mixed up about it did people revenge other people or have revenge on them or what i looked it up in the dictionary malicious injuring in return for an injury or offense received i got a piece of paper and wrote it down the canneziano girls want to injure maliciously some one on the desert moon ranch in return for an injury or an offense received i crossed out the canneziano girls and wrote gabrielle canneziano since danny had said that she had never considered that side of it at all it did not help any it did not make sense since sam and i were the only people on the ranch they had known before they came here this time it seemed as if they had come to injure maliciously one of us i had never done either of them a mite of harm in my life sam had never done anything but good for them of course sam had not been very gentle with their father but as i took pains to discover neither of them had any kind feelings for their father gaby said straight out that she hated him danny who was too gentle speaking to use such a word as hate said that she had never liked him never loved him both of them laid their mother s death at canneziano s door they thought that his cruelty and his neglect had killed her it was senseless to suppose that they were harboring a grudge against sam for anything that he had ever done to canneziano of course i see now that all that part of it was as plain as the roman nose on hubert hand s face how i missed seeing it even then i don t know i was i guess like a little boy so busy trying to watch all three rings at the circus at one time that he missed the elephant parade the desert moon was like that sure enough like a three ring circus during the months of may and june there were the girls everlastingly searching for something leaving the house shortly after the men left it each morning returning tired out just in time for dinner off again for the afternoon and coming home just in time to pretty up for supper after a while i began to lose interest in that and being a woman i allowed my attention to become distracted by the center ring where all the love interest was going on not that danny and john were interesting if there is anything that will make two people duller to all other people than being engaged to each other i am sure i don t know what it is gaby s unceasing efforts to win john away from danny were interesting enough i suppose to folks who can stand to look at that sort of thing personally i shut my eyes to it as much as possible most of my attention i gave to the clown in the ring to chad i can not explain it now or ever but chad from the very first was head over heels in love with gaby he had no more chance of winning her penniless funny kind little fellow that he was than an amateur has of riding an outlaw pony i told him that once in those very words i know it mary he said but you are wrong about one thing i m not riding for a fall i m not even mounted i know i haven t a chance with her i know i can t pull one of those stars out of the sky up there with a fishhook i m not trying but i can sit here in the dark and look at the stars can t i stars make all the difference in the dark and maybe sometime i can serve her in someway that s all i ask so on if it hadn t been chad and therefore heartbreaking it would have been downright funny she never gave him two looks he couldn t even make her laugh with his jokes and his songs as he could the rest of us once she did deign to allow him to try to teach her the trick of his ventriloquism she could not learn it and she was furious with him and said that he did not want her to learn it but he followed her about and waited on her he brought her pony up to the house instead of allowing one of the outfit to do it he brought her desert flowers which she tossed away to wither if connie hadn t had a strong constitution he would have worn her out taking pictures of gaby page after page in his album filled with gaby by the window gaby on the porch gaby and danny starting on a walk gaby in riding costume gaby here there and everywhere and martha half mad with jealousy right at first i think that some of the others thought that martha s jealousy was something of a joke i never did think so before long we all began to feel that it was more than a little serious sam talked to chad and to gaby about it chad did the best he could after that to be as attentive to martha as he had been before but if he so much as opened a door for gaby martha would go into temper fits and sulking spells as for gaby sam s talk with her made things worse she had never noticed chad at all so she had not noticed that martha was jealous of him she welcomed the news as another tool she could use to tease and torment the poor girl all along she had delighted in teasing and tormenting martha though she had dared not do it when sam was present the very evening after sam had talked to her in the morning gaby went and sat beside chad and curled his pretty yellow curls around her finger it was a cloudy evening not chilly but sam had lighted the fire as he always does when he has half an excuse and martha was sitting in front of it pretending to read a magazine she had been pretending to read that same magazine on the same page for the last five years she seemed to get pleasure out of sitting and holding it in her hands no other magazine would do of a sudden this evening she thrust the magazine in the flames for an instant jerked it out and rushed at gaby with the burning torch no harm was done john snatched it and tossed it back into the fireplace but all of us except gaby had the good sense to be thoroughly frightened things weren t ever quite the same for martha after that no other magazine or picture book would take the place of the one she had burned she would wander about the house evenings quietly but restless like a cat who had lost her kittens one of gaby s pleasant little ways was to refer to martha as an idiot right before her face la la gaby exclaimed one evening when martha was wandering about the idiot gets on my nerves can t you make her keep still mrs ricker she isn t harming anyone i said since mrs ricker as usual said nothing you leave her alone and stop talking like that miss i m not harming anyone now martha piped up but someday i might i d like to i won t though she walked over close to gaby if you ll give me the gold monkey i ll be good then for always it was a bracelet charm of gaby s a gold monkey about the size of a large almond with jade eyes the minute martha had seen it she had begun to beg for it there weren t any monkeys in the jewelry catalogs but sam sent off and got her a bear and a turtle she wouldn t have any truck with them she wanted that one particular monkey gaby would not give it to her would not so much as allow her to wear it for a few hours at a time as usual this evening she refused to let martha touch it yes and you ll be sorry martha threatened she went upstairs and emptied a can of pepper in gaby s handkerchief box she was always playing tricks of the sort on gaby if we did not watch her for my own part i wouldn t have bothered with watching her but for the fact that more than often she got the two girls mixed up and it was danny whose pretty dress would be tied to the chair to tear instead of gaby s or danny s hair would receive the contents of chad s paste pot and then martha discovering her mistake would make herself ill with crying and remorse just as she had hated gaby from the start she had loved danny but she could not tell them apart it seemed incredible that even martha could be confused about the two girls because if ever girls were opposites those girls were of course they were the same size about five feet and two inches tall i should judge and the same weight both of them too skinny to my way of thinking flat as bread boards their faces just their faces did look alike they both had long brown eyes straight noses small mouths gaby painted her lips until they looked much fuller and more curved than danny s pointed chins and complexions the color of real light caramel frosting danny s cheeks showed a faint pink coming and going gaby painted her cheekbones clear back to her ears with a deep orange pink color they both had wavy dark brown hair cut just the same in the back real close fitting and down to a point but gaby brushed her hair straight back from her forehead and put varnish stuff on it till it was as sleek and shining as patent leather she left all of her ears showing and she always wore big earrings dangling from them danny parted her hair on the side and allowed it to wave loose and soft and pretty she never wore earrings gaby s clothes were all loud colored or seemed to be black turned gaudy when she put it on and they were all insecure appearing too defiant of paper patterns to be quite moral danny s clothes were as neat and quiet as a pigeon s no wonder that these frequent mistakes of martha s made me decide that she was losing her eyesight i spoke to sam about it suggesting that mrs ricker would better take her to san francisco to visit an oculist according to his usual custom sam laughed at me he said that he had about concluded that martha was the only one on the place who could use her eyes to see deeper than gee gaws and fol de rols if you are insinuating i said that those two girls are alike in any respect inside or outside you ve lost your senses why shouldn t they be alike sam questioned they are twin sisters they were brought up together they have had the same friends the same teaching the same environments of course they are alike one of them is play acting i don t know which one i suspect danielle on account of john i may as well state right here that all of this remark of sam s with the exception of the girls being twin sisters was a mistake from beginning to end i didn t at that time know much of anything about their past lives i did know their present characters i told him so he laughed again and wanted to know what had become of all my theories concerning our modern young girls ever since the war i had been standing up for them through thick and thin it takes a pretty stout theory i admitted to hear a young lady called a damn good sport and see her receive it as a choice compliment who said that to who sam wanted to know who do you suppose hubert hand to gaby of course hubert hand sam said had better behave himself since hubert hand was too selfish ever to love anything that his roman nose wasn t attached to his carryings on with gaby should be classed i think not in the center ring but as the main attraction of the third ring and he almost old enough to be her father with white coming into his hair at his temples to this day i have never understood those two during those months gaby was in love with john hubert hand was in love with hubert hand yet they hugged and kissed and seemed to think that calling it necking made it respectable it wasn t a flirtation with them it was more like a fight where each of them was fighting for something they did not want a perfectly footless none too wholesome performance you make him behave himself sam i urged he is free white and twenty one and she sure can take care of herself if ever a girl could it s none of my put in what about the rest of us i said forced to watch such goings on don t watch if you watch belle and sadie and goldie that is watching enough for one woman belle sadie and goldie were the indian women i had at that time to help me around the place i suppose they were pretty good girls they did all the actual work there was to do around the house except the cooking with me directing them every step they took but when i remember how they all deserted me in the time of our terrible trouble it makes me so fighting mad that i don t like to give them credit for anything nor think about them at all even yet chapter viii atmosphere the girls had been on the desert moon a little better than six weeks when one evening sam came out into my kitchen were i was setting bread belle sadie and goldie had gone home and i had tidied up after them as usual and everything in the kitchen was sweet and clean and shining i had the doors tight shut so i couldn t hear the radio screeching away in the living room and the windows open and the evening breeze fresh from the deserts came in blowing back my ruffled white curtains and purifying the air mary sam began real solemn for him the ancients used to have cities that they called cities of refuge no matter what a fellow had done if he could get inside into one of those cities he was safe your kitchen always kinda seems like that to me a city of refuge lands sam i said what have you been up to that you are heading this safety first movement to tell the truth i was a little put out with him for moseying in there when i was setting bread like most men i ve known sam never had any particular hankering for my company unless he thought i could be of some use to him generally i am glad and proud to help sam anyway i can but not when i am setting bread there is something about setting bread that gives any moral woman a contented uplifted feeling that she likes to indulge in undisturbed i haven t been up to anything sam answered and i don t aim to be but mary some time ago you came to me with some suspicions i laughed them off i am not laughing now i m worried queer things are going on around here what i want to know now is what do you know nothing what do you know nothing what do you suspect then sam nothing what do you nothing that i see now wouldn t have been a bad place for us both to laugh neither of us did have you any idea sam questioned why the girls go prowling all over the place afoot and horseback day times and night times too when they should be in their beds i unfolded a dishtowel and spread it over my pan of bread it was ready for rising and i had not got a bit of uplift out of it if i told you i said you d only speak your little memory gem about so much good in the worst of us no i won t mary i m all set for listening well all i know is just what i ve known all along they are hunting for something sure they are hunting for something but what i don t know but whatever it is they are going to use it to get revenge to injure maliciously somebody revenge hell sam said have it your own way only i happened one night to hear gaby say to danny that they had come to this ranch for the purpose of revenge revenge hell sam repeated himself unless they are sore at me about canneziano it doesn t make sense they hate canneziano i ve about decided that they have come here to get revenge on maliciously injure someone who isn t on the place brighten the corner where you are sam scoffed but never mind what else did they say when you happened to overhear this revenge remark if he was ready at last to listen i was more than ready to tell what little i knew i told even to confessing about hiding in the clothes closet well well he drawled when i had finished my story we are probably making a mountain out of a molehill i wouldn t go pussy footing around after them any more if i were you mary there s a screw loose somewhere that s sure but it is not in the desert moon s machinery we ve got nothing on our consciences we don t need to worry don t need to worry sam and i sitting in that peaceful kitchen talking so smart and frivolous and deciding that we did not need to worry is a memory i could well be shed of we didn t need to worry a bit more than if i d used arsenic in my covered pan of bread not a bit more than if there had been a den of rattlesnakes in the cupboard under the sink or gasoline instead of water in the tank on the back of the stove that is how safe and peaceful we really were at that minute if we had had sense enough to know it when i realize that four weeks from that very evening three people but i guess it would be better to tell things straight along as they happened it seems to me a good book can not be hurried any more than a good cake can mix and sift the dry ingredients is the way all recipes for cakes begin however since i suspected that i knew a sight more about making a good cake than i did about making a good book and since the young man from back east indiana in nevada for his matrimonial health as are about half of the population here happened in just after i had finished writing the above paragraph i asked him whether he would for a consideration read and correct my manuscript he had said when he had come in from his fishing on boulder creek that afternoon and asked to buy a meal that he was an author by profession the looks of him almost made me decide not to put myself in his class i don t know why it is that easterners coming out here and buying the same sort of clothes that our men wear look so ridiculous in them but they do anyway i invited him to stay to supper and then as i have said made the proposition about the manuscript he said that he would be only too happy to edit the yarn but that it would probably take him several days to do it efficiently in other words though he grandly refused the consideration he got three full days of board and rooms and fishing on the desert moon in return for around two hours of work and i got my clean pages all marked up with whoms and whichs and funny dodad marks it took me more than two hours to get them all erased now he said when he finally had read it i am going to be frank with you you mention dry ingredients in my opinion you have far too many dry ingredients and it is taking you much too long to accomplish the mixing process a book to be successful has to move swiftly this is particularly true of stories of crime and their detection a properly constructed story of this sort begins with the murder the wisest thing for you to do is to burn all of this that you have done and make a fresh beginning at the time of the first murder in the new copy do attempt to get in some atmosphere you must make your readers feel the setting as it were bring them across the wide and multicolored deserts that lie between here and telko to this marvelous farm show them the massive mountain ranges surrounding it let them breathe the rarefied air drink deeply of the beauty give them the changing colors of the mountains from their jade greens to their rich ruby hues with the purpling cloud shadows swaying across them let them hear the scurrying of the desert rats the calls of the owls the howls of the coyotes paint for them the slender white trunks of your aspen trees and the green quivering of their leaves the harsh rugged beauty the color the wonder of this northeastern nevada of yours is marvelous beyond description but for all of it that your manuscript shows the action might have taken place on a chicken farm in vermont if the folks who read this story i said are downright pining for nevada atmosphere let them come out here and get it there is plenty for all a mile and a half of it statistics show for each person now in the state nobody ever reads the descriptions in a story anyway i ve decided that authors put them in for the same reason that a cook when unexpected company comes makes a double amount of dressing for the chicken or serves her creamed canned oysters on toast to fill up to make enough to go around well mrs magin he said i can only remark that as an author you are a most excellent cook when i heard the first variation of that i said years and years and years ago i thought it was a little comical i am sorry he answered i thought that you were the sort of person who would appreciate sincere criticism even though it might not be wholly complimentary job wasn t i told him and i don t set up to be any better than he was what is more if you can point to any man or woman in history or out of it who ever did appreciate sincere uncomplimentary criticism i ll pepper this story so full of atmosphere that folks will think they are reading booster club s literature about florida he could not do it consequently i continue this story in my own way stating that if any more atmosphere is in it it got there by mistake my plan is to turn it out so that from now on not more than a page of it can be skipped at one time and the rest of it make sense chapter ix the cabin for three days beginning with the fourth of july there was to be a big celebration and rodeo at telko trying to keep cowpunchers on the ranch when there was a celebration of any sort going on within a distance of a couple of hundred miles would be about as sensible as trying to keep gunpowder in a hot oven so all the outfit that was on the ranch never very many in july were tinkering with their flivvers and currying their mounts and building up their boot heels and washing and ironing and making elaborate preparations to attend sam suggested at noon on the second of july while we were at dinner that maybe all of us would like to go all that is except martha and himself celebrations were never good for martha i spoke right up and said to count me out i know the deserts in july but the boys were enthusiastic about it and danny was interested gaby coming in late greeted the idea with the same enthusiasm with which a woman greets moths in the clothes closet whence the crave for a fourth of july celebration she asked we have never seen a rodeo danny answered go by all means gaby said buy pink lemonade march in the parade ride in the liberty car mrs magin would be stunning as the goddess of liberty with don t let my stunningness stop anything i said i am not going we ll think it over danny said it would be a long hot ride probably we should all have a pleasanter time right here at home but there was something in the way she had said it too quickly in answer to a look from gaby that made me think there was more to her backing out of the plan than had appeared on the surface gaby had just begun her dinner the rest of us had finished so according to our custom we excused ourselves and went our ways chad tried to stay with gaby but martha fussed and insisted that he come with her i had a sure feeling that danny would return and that she and gaby would have something to say to each other i went into the kitchen and told belle to clean the stove nothing made belle so angry as to have to clean the stove the angrier she got the more she clattered when i stepped back into the pass pantry and opened the pass window a crack the kitchen sounded as if half a dozen women were busy in it just as i opened the window i heard john say i thought danny was in here no gaby said but won t you come in and talk to me what about about this i dared not peek so i did not know what she meant until she said why won t you kiss me shall i say i don t want to pick flowers in hubert hand s yard i hate you don t be sore at me gaby john said but i m telling you that s a lot nearer the truth than than what you usually say john was one of the poorest talkers ever heard one of those strong silent men supposed to abound in the west and who are likewise supposed to make every word that they say count if john s did they counted backwards my dear haven t i proven over and over again that i love you i don t know how in every way i have made myself ridiculous here because i haven t been able to conceal my feelings for you i think john said that most of that stuff you pull is just to spite danny it doesn t spite her though she knows she s the only girl in the world for me i wish you d cut it out all of that gaby won t you and just be good friends you d not want me for an enemy would you getting at anything going any place gaby perhaps if danny should hear that you have made love to me i have never made love to you it would be your word against mine i think danny would take mine if it came to a show down you d lie about it gosh no gaby a lot worse than that i d tell the truth about it listen here child don t you try to make trouble between danny and me meaning nothing except that it wouldn t be healthy for anyone who tried it boo oo dangerous dan mcgrew stuff out where men are men killer loose to night all that eh johnnie nothing like that he said and his voice was so gentle that if gaby had been a puncher she would have reached for her six gun but killing would be too good for the imaginary person we are talking about a door opened john came in danny s voice uncle is looking everywhere for you what danny questioned when the door had closed behind john made you both look so angry just now nothing important john had just threatened to kill me but don t be silly never mind are you going to that fools celebration with only a day or two left now i suppose not if you don t want me to i d love going i know there is no use in staying here in other words you would sacrifice my future for a rodeo that is silly everything is always silly with you i more than half believe that you know that s sil i mean what possible object could i have many my dear very many though i think that getting rid of me would outweigh the others gaby i don t want to get rid of you i wish you would not be so silly with john but you know how eager i was to get you away from the continent i wish i knew that you were going to stay right here for always is that your game listen to me danielle canneziano if i thought that you were keeping this from me in order to bury me alive in this god forsaken hole and force me to watch you and john gaby i ve been a fool why can t i learn to take into consideration your damn moralities understand this dan don t fancy for one instant that failure is going to keep me here did you think with a weapon like that in my hands that i d stand for anything less than a fifty fifty proposition our original plan would have been better easier simpler but i ll have my share out of this anyway so if you do know gaby i don t know i ll swear that i don t how could i but surely you wouldn t wouldn t attempt that is for you to say darling darling as she said it then was as wicked a word as i had ever listened to for me to say give john to me i ve changed my mind if you ll do that i ll stay right here and settle down and do an imitation of a moral model wife that would satisfy even you gaby you speak as if john were a child s toy to be passed about i couldn t give him to you if i were willing to you could and you know it you won t so that s that but keep your righteous fingers out of my life stop your damn preaching and meddling i am going to the cabin now you would better come with me we ve searched that cabin a thousand times all the same it is the one logical place far removed and under cover too i must see whether that indian nailed those floor boards down again before i pay him the cabin is the one sam built to live in when he first came to the valley it is up boulder creek about half a mile from the ranch house and built in a big grove of aspen trees it is one of the prettiest spots on the place sam has kept it in repair inside and out owing i think to sentimental memories though he declares it is because he dislikes wreckage on the place the best fishing on the creek begins just above there so the men as a rule leave their fishing paraphernalia in the cabin s kitchen that is the only use the place has been put to since john and martha were little things and sam used to hide their christmas presents up there under the shelf in the kitchen the shelf about three feet wide is built across one end of the kitchen it served sam for a table pantry and sink being a man he built it right handily like a chest so that the entire top of it had to be raised to get to the storage place underneath there was no secret about it all anyone had to do was to move everything off the top of it and lift the lid but i had read how the hardest problems for detectives always turned out to be something that had been too simple to notice so my plan was to go up there and raise the lid on my way i met the girls coming home i imagined that they looked at me with suspicion i passed a remark about the sweet smelling clover hay and hurried right along half an hour later when i was expecting instant death at any minute i thought about that sweet clover smell and how unappreciative i have been of it and of the blue sky and fresh air and of the green things lighted yellow with sunshine and i took a vow that if i ever did get a chance to enjoy them again i would spend the remainder of my life in so doing and in being grateful to the creator of them the same as the last time i had a jumping toothache i thought that if that tooth ever did stop aching nothing could ever make me unhappy again i was going to be peacefully happy always for the reason that i did not have a toothache human nature i have since decided is never happy because of negatives at least i have never known anyone who was happy for long because he did not have a toothache or was not in a hospital or not hungry or not which brings me back to my story shut up in a chest with packages of explosives in the cabin i went at once to the kitchen and removing fish baskets fly books and reels from the shelf lifted it back i am sure that i had expected to find it empty perhaps i had hoped to find a small iron box containing a treasure or a jewel casket or maybe an aged leather case containing the missing will or the plans of some secret fortification any of the simple ordinary things generally hunted for and discovered what i had not expected to find and what i certainly had never hoped to find was what was there any number of neatly wrapped packages addressed to mr sam stanley sent by express and labeled variously danger explosives handle with care chapter x a conversation i am not claiming that i possessed one particle of common sense at that minute nor for a good many minutes after that my actions would give the lie direct to any such assertion on my part it did not take any common sense to know straight off that sent to him or not sam was not mixed up in any business that had to do with explosives bombs and bolshevism it was easy enough to remember then that sam had not been to rattail for the past ten days that hubert hand had been making the trips down for the mail expressage and supplies just as he came into my mind i heard his voice it was a startling coincidence but i need a better excuse than that for surely no mortal ever did a more foolish thing than i did then i climbed into that chest along with those packages and lowered the lid down over me if i had any idea i suppose it must have been a desire not to let him know that i had discovered his secret his and gaby s together undoubtedly but i can t remember having any thought at all until just as the lid closed i remembered the sad poem about the bride and the mistletoe chest i thought then that her situation was comfortable compared to mine if you have never been packed in a box with a lot of explosives as i hope you have not you can have no notion of what i went through i could have climbed out but if you are an elderly woman of my size and build as i hope you are not and if you have a certain reputation for dignity to live up to and a certain reputation for snooping to live down you can have an idea why i didn t come springing out of there like a jack in the box or like the immoral ladies who emerge from pies so the papers say at bachelor s parties i weighed the matter carefully as i heard through the thin boards hubert hand talking to someone come into the kitchen i chose death by suffocation or combustion my dear woman were the first words i heard from him you may set your mind at rest i am not going to marry the girl i am not a marrying man as you know and if i were she wouldn t have me you leave her alone then understand me leave her alone if i believed my ears that was mrs ricker s voice that was mrs ricker not only talking but talking like that to hubert hand you flatter me he said jealous still after all these years i despise you but you leave that girl alone if you think i ll stand silent and allow you to marry her hire a hall i told you that i wouldn t marry her and that she wouldn t have me if i were willing to wouldn t she though wouldn t she she is mad about you she can t look at you without love in her eyes nor speak to you without love in her voice she tries to hide it but she can t hide it from me i know she loves you i am not sure whether i read it or whether i figured it out for myself but i do know it is a fact that no woman ever accuses another woman of being in love with a man unless she could imagine being in love with him herself as to that hubert hand said in that preeny offhand manner that men who will discuss their love affairs at all use when discussing them what possible difference could it make to you ollie only that i would kill her and you too before i would let her have you easy on there my girl your last attempt at murder at least i hope that was your last attempt was not you may recall very successful i would be successful another time i clamped my teeth to keep them from chattering i wished that i had some way as easy for muffling the sound made by the pounding of my heart which was thudding away as loudly as a butter churn in rapid action except for that i kept quiet very quiet surrounded in there by explosives and out there by people who talked of murder as calmly and as comfortably as if they were discussing moss roses very quiet did not seem half quiet enough they went into the other room of the cabin and stayed there for a few minutes i could not hear what they were saying but i did not budge an inch after i heard them passing the window and was sure that they had left the cabin i remained very quiet in the chest for about five minutes longer before climbing out of it i was progressing toward home shivering in every bone limping since both my legs had gone to sleep when sam riding his bad tempered bronco named wishbone came up behind me and dismounted corns bad mary he questioned must be going to have rain keep water in the ditches both my feet are asleep from the ankles up upon my soul first time in history you ever sat still in one place long enough to have that happen well well do the thing that s nearest want to climb up on wishbone and have me lead him when i go to meet death i told him i shan t go on the back of a nasty tempered bronco speaking of tempers sam grinned a person would think i had sung your feet to sleep mary considering i replied that everyone on the desert moon is at this minute in mortal danger of their lives all your lighthearted jesting seems pretty much out of place i told him then about the packages of explosives hidden under the shelf i had not told him about my climbing in with them so i was in no way prepared for his actions he stopped he dropped wishbone s bridle he put both his hands on his stomach and leaned over and burst into uproarious laughter ho ho ho it rolled out seeming to fill the entire valley he leaned to one side he leaned to the other side and kept on laughing to deafen the far distant deserts fireworks he gasped i got them for martha going to surprise her on the fourth sent for them months ago hid them up there ho ho ho i told you to stop pussy footing around mary ho ho ho do not look for wrong and evil you will find them if you do with as much dignity as a heavy woman with both of her legs asleep could muster i turned and left him his words and his actions had certainly given me one decision from this time on i would tell sam stanley nothing chapter xi the letter when i got back to the house john was driving up the road in the sedan he had been to rattail for supplies and for the mail he tossed the mailbag out to me and drove around to the kitchen door to unload as a rule the desert moon mail is mighty uninteresting being made up almost entirely of bills and advertising matter since the girls had come a few sleazy foreign looking letters had livened it up a bit to a person who has never been farther east than salt lake city a letter from england or from france does carry quite a thrill with it there was a letter for gaby to day postmarked france about a month before this gaby had received another letter that was a duplicate of this one the same gray paper the same sprawling handwriting instead of taking it indifferently as she did other letters and reading it wherever she happened to be she had snatched it out of my hand and had run off to her room all that evening she had seemed to be preoccupied and worried the writing looked like a man s writing but like a lot of other things including cigarette smoke hip pockets and hair cuts it is not as easy as it used to be to distinguish between male and female in handwriting at a distance sending only two letters in close to two months it seemed to me that whoever had written them did not write unless he or she had something of importance to say i was still puzzling over it when gaby came into the room sure enough she snatched it out of my hands just as she had done with the other letter and ran straight upstairs with it when john and danny came in a few minutes later i went upstairs habit stopped me at gaby s door for a minute with my ear to the keyhole faintly sounds don t come plainly through our thick doors i heard the portable typewriter that she had brought with her when she came to the ranch click clicking away my first judgment was that she was not losing any time in answering that letter but as i went down the hall i had a hazy notion that there had been something queer different about the way she had been using the machine instead of snapping away on it lickety split as she usually did she had been touching the keys slowly and carefully picking them out one at a time the way i have to do when i try to use sam s plaguey machine to copy recipes for my card catalog i was tuckered and tired so after telephoning some instructions to belle and sadie in the kitchen i took plenty of time to tidy myself up i dawdled in my bath and i cut my corns and rubbed hair tonic into my scalp but when on my way downstairs again i stopped for a second at gaby s door the typewriter was still going with its slow click click there was nothing to be made out of it so i went along it was fortunate that i did because before i had reached the top of the stairway gaby s door flung open and she called to me with something in her voice that made me shake in my shoes i turned and looked at her her face wore an expression that was not human an expression that would have made any decent woman do as i did and turn her eyes quickly away tell danny to come up here she said i hurried off downstairs and delivered the message to danny who was with john in the living room what s the matter mary john questioned when danny had gone upstairs you look as if you had seen a ghost i think i answered that i have the ghost of sin doggone that girl he said i wish she were in jericho gaby you mean you re darn right she s causing all the trouble around here what trouble i asked just for a feeler i don t know exactly she keeps danny miserable but that isn t it or not all of it don t you seem to feel trouble around here all the time i thought everyone did i do gosh knows i know i said i feel it too i think sam does though he won t altogether admit it just the same john there isn t a thing we can put our fingers on is there he walked to the window and looked out at the long range of garnet mountains turning blood red now under the sunset i suppose not he said at last sometimes though when i see danny looking as she looked when she went upstairs just now i feel as if it would be a good thing if somebody would put their fingers around that vixen s throat john i spoke sharply to him don t say things like that you don t mean it it is wrong to say it i was sure that he did not mean it i was sure that only the voice of one of his rare ugly moods had spoken and that the wicked thought had died with the wicked words but from that day to this i have never repeated those words to a living soul because that was the way that gaby was murdered choked to death with great brutal bruises left on her throat chapter xii an insight in spite of all my efforts not to do so i have again run on ahead of the story but i declare to goodness the horror of it after all these months is still so strong upon me that i know the only way to get that written is to write it with no more dilly dally and then to go back and lead up to it properly with the events that immediately preceded it that evening then the second of july the two girls came down late together danny was paler than usual and her face had a drawn hurt look which she explained by saying that she had a severe headache gaby was gayer than gay i kept watching her trying to catch her face in repose to see if any trace remained of that dreadful expression i had seen in the afternoon her face nor one bit of her was in repose for a minute from the time she came downstairs until she went upstairs again after twelve o clock that night she put la paloma on the phonograph and did a spanish dance clicking her heels and snapping her fingers until they sounded like firecrackers she did an egyptian dance slinking about and contortioning it wasn t decent she got the whole crowd including the girls from the kitchen who had stayed to gape through the door at her dancing instead of going home as they should have gone and excluding only danny with her headache mrs ricker and me to join in a game of follow the leader and she led them a wild chase all over the house from cellar to attic laughing and jumping and screaming and shouting they went with the radio shrieking out the jazz orchestra in los angeles and me with depression so heavy upon me that it felt real like indigestion mrs ricker was doing some tatting as i watched her i decided that ears or no ears she was not the woman i had heard talking that afternoon up in the cabin hubert hand had said to that woman that she had attempted murder she could not have been mrs ricker not our mrs ricker the thin silent woman who had lived so decently with us for so long those white bony fingers darting the shuttle back and forth making edgings for handkerchiefs had never held any murderous weapon those tight wrinkled lips had never said i would kill her and you too john had never said i shivered it was fanciful thinking but it seemed to me that for years the desert moon had ridden in our sky clean and clear a lucky fair weather moon and that now the shadow of the wicked world was slowly creeping over it inch by inch with the darkness that was to end in its eclipse wicked thoughts and wicked words breed wicked actions and i knew it then as now martha came crying to mrs ricker gaby hurt chad she said i wish she would die we could make her a nice funeral mrs ricker s fingers darted faster back and forth danny spoke from the davenport you shouldn t talk like that martha dear it is wrong her voice sounded as if it ached she looked lying in a huddle over there as miserable as i felt i was drawn to her i went and sat beside her could i do anything for your headache i asked get you some asperin maybe no thank you mary there was so much gratitude in her big dark eyes for nothing but common decency on my part that i felt downright ashamed of myself danny i said straight out never caring much about mincing words i know that something is troubling you why don t you tell john or sam or even me about it just tell us the truth we d all go far to help you if we could her eyes filled with tears bless your heart mary she said bless all of your hearts you are all so good here i was enough annoyed with john for coming up right then to have slapped him i answered his question for danny there is plenty you could do for her i said you could shut off that screeching radio for one thing and you could quiet down and get the others quieted down nobody ever told me that noise like this was a remedy for a splitting headache did they you the dickens by gollies it is a wonder you wouldn t have told me before mary man fashion putting the blame on me danny wouldn t hear to john s stopping the racket everyone was having such a good time bed was the place for her she couldn t hear any noise in her room with the door shut and off she went i know now that she would not have told me anything that could have helped matters but i did not know it then and i was sorely disappointed for those sudden tears in her eyes and her voice when she had said bless your heart had convinced me that there was sincerity behind them and honesty and good in the black days that followed when all of us were living in the dark shadows of doubts and confusions and fears and suspicions i was thankful time and again for those certainties for that one fleeting but sure insight into danny s soul chapter xiii the quarrel the morning of the third was biting hot with that stinging piercing heat that we have when we have heat at all in this high altitude the sixty mile trip across the deserts to telko on a day like this would be exactly the same as a sixty mile trip through an oven at the right heat for a roast of beef nevertheless before seven o clock that morning every man jack of a puncher on the place with all of his trimmings and trappings including wives squaws papooses children and firearms had set off in flivvers or on horseback bound for the celebration leaving the place hole empty as sam said when he came into my kitchen with a gallon of cream from the dairy he pulled the stool out from under the table perched on it and remarked as cheerfully as if he were reading it off a tombstone sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof i didn t want him bothering me in the kitchen when i had everything to do with belle sadie and goldie gone gadding but being a woman normal i hope i asked him what he meant by that i m not going to be surprised he answered if we have another visitor one of these days nor me either i said though much astonished because it was as if he had read my mind at that minute i had been worrying about sadie she was expecting her baby before long and land only knew what such a trip as she was off taking now and the celebration to boot might precipitate that fool girl i went on it wouldn t surprise me a bit if this was the death of her not a bit pshaw sam said what have you found out mary she told me herself the last of july yes i thought all along that she knew since he seemed as sober as an owl and as serious i decided that there was no answer to make and i made none she s off a few weeks though i sent a telegram and got an answer yesterday it is the fourth of july sam i found breath to retort one of us is plumb crazy i think it is you do you think it is me not to make any bones about it sam said i have thought here lately that every dang soul on the place was only saved from being in the asylum because of the ignorance of the authorities but in this case i think i am sane and certain i wired the warden of the penitentiary he said that daniel canneziano was to be released on the morning of the fourth of july gaby told you the last of july probably some time off for good behavior i wasn t talking about canneziano i snapped and how did i know you were i was talking about sadie s baby i dropped into a chair feeling sort of weakened from the news about canneziano and waited with what patience i could for sam to stop laughing you mark my words i said when the laugh had gone down to a silly giggle over which i could make myself heard all these queer actions around here have something to do with that man s release i ll bet you sam said but blame my soul if i know what to do about anything i know what i d do about canneziano if he shows up here i told him yes i know but he is danny s father and danny is going to marry john after all money is not much good unless you take it to market if i could come to a decent agreement with the fellow and if he d take that gaby with him i m dead certain that her hanging around here isn t going to contribute any to john s and danny s married life what do you mean by that sam gaby asked the question walking right into the kitchen i was all taken aback but sam didn t seem to be eavesdroppers my girl he said hear no good of themselves i mean that i don t think any girl who wanted to act right would treat her sister s betrothed as you treat john you she said very slowly to make insult baste each word are a damned old fool sam stanley i shook in my shoes i had not dreamed that there was a living human being who would dare say that in that tone of voice to sam he stood up he put his hands on her shoulders gently though and turned her around you are a bad wayward girl he said march out of here now and get your manners mended before i see you again he sobered even her for a minute she walked to the door without another word there she whirled around like a crazy thing and i declare to goodness i don t know what she said it was the sort of talking i had never heard in my life my ears were not enough accustomed to the words to take in their meanings but one thing that she kept screaming screaming so loudly that she could be heard all over the place was that sam had threatened her once too often sam stood there paralyzed i think as i was for perhaps a couple of minutes before he turned and walked off into the backyard hubert hand came rushing in gaby threw her arms around his neck and kept on with the screaming and sobbing chad came in through the pantry mrs ricker opened the door that was at the foot of the back stairway she stood there in the doorway watching hubert hand with both his arms around gaby petting and soothing her she dampened her tight lips with her tongue but without saying a word she went back up the stairs closing the door behind her hubert hand led gaby into the dining room and through it into the living room what in god s name happened chad said to me i went and washed my face and took a drink of water chad i said gabrielle canneziano has lost her mind she is insane his face went white as lard i don t believe it either that i said or else she is the wickedest the stop it he shouted at me you nor anyone can talk to me like that about the girl i love love love your foot i snapped at him the idea of mooning about love to me at a time like that none of you understands her he said nor tries to she is in some sort of trouble terrible trouble anyone can see that i d give my soul to help her to serve her if you are so crazy about serving her i said you might go into the dining room and set the table and help me serve her and the rest of you some breakfast he went into the yard like a lot of men i thought who want to give their souls and so on to women he didn t care to be bothered with smaller details such as feeding them i wronged him whether or not a man has the giving of his soul in his own hands i do not know a man can give his life that is what chad gave chapter xiv two departures after dinner which we didn t have until nearly one o clock on the fourth of july owing to chad s not getting the ice cream frozen on time john surprised us all by saying that he was going to take the sedan and drive down to rattail for the mail i suspicioned right then that he was up to something he could not fool me into thinking that he would take a fifty mile trip twenty five miles each way through the desert heat for no other reason than to get the mail he couldn t do any trading since all of rattail would be off to the telko celebration when danny seemed hurt and troubled about him going and when he went riding right off anyway i decided that sam must have sent him expecting some word concerning canneziano i was wrong we had had a stiff breeze with a promising sprinkle of rain in the morning but it had died down about noon and at two o clock it was too tarnation hot to do anything but try to keep cool i stacked the dinner dishes to wash in the evening and joined the others sitting around in the living room with the electric fans going full blast sam chess board in hand stopped long enough by my chair to say in an undertone what did i tell you mary it is always darkest just before the dawn that piece of optimism from him was due in part to the extra good holiday dinner he had just eaten and in part to a sense of quiet edging close to peace that had pervaded the place since morning i had noticed it too with thankfulness and had accounted for it with the supposition that gaby had spent all of her energy in meanness the day before and was obliged to rest up for a spell that s a nice little piece i answered sam there is another one though isn t there about a lull before the storm that was not pure contrariness on my part i was expecting every minute to see gaby break out again she didn t she yawned around and fussed about and then went and sat beside danny who was looking at the pictures in the ladies home journal and put her arm around her and petted her up a little a most unusual performance for her when chad who had been monkeying with the radio got a rip roaring patriotic program from salt lake the two girls went upstairs together a few minutes later i had an errand upstairs a real one i wouldn t have taken myself up in that heat to satisfy any curiosity so out of habit i stopped at gaby s door to listen i heard the girls giggling in there and knowing no great harm is afoot when girls giggle i went on got my scrap of pongee silk to mend sam s shirt and came downstairs again sam and hubert hand were deep in their chess game mrs ricker was tatting chad and martha were playing dots and crosses in spite of the noise from the radio there was a comfortable feeling about the room that made me lonesome for the days we had all had together before the canneziano girls had come the radio program which was to last from two until four o clock had just that minute stopped martha who when she didn t forget it usually fed her rabbits about that time of day had gone out to do it gaby came downstairs humming a tune she had on the tomato soup colored wrap that she had worn on the train and the hat to match the wrap she was carrying a beaded bag she never dressed up like that to go walking around the place a wrap even such a light one in the heat of that day was downright ridiculous chad said all dressed up and no place to go she tossed her head at him and hurried straight down the room and out through the glass doors chad followed her they stopped together on the porch she stood with her back to me chad faced me in a minute i saw his mouth bend up into a grin of bliss nothing would have surprised me more for this reason as that girl had walked through the room i had seen that she walked in mortal fear in spite of her humming in spite of her attempted swagger fear was in her widened eyes in her drawn in chin in the contraction of her shoulders wherever it was that she was going she was afraid to go but where could she go john had the sedan except for the trucks which she couldn t drive and her pony she surely would not be dressed like that to ride horseback there was no way for her to get off the place it must be then that someone was coming to the place and that she was going out alone to meet them who canneziano not unless sam had been mistaken about the time when he was to be released from prison usually when people think at all they think quickly all this had gone through my mind while she had walked the forty feet to the door before chad smiled i had spoken to mrs ricker that girl i said is afraid of something mrs ricker darted her tatting shuttle back and forth she moistened her lips with her tongue but changed her mind and said nothing gaby and chad stood on the porch talking for two or three minutes a very short time at any rate then she went down the steps and chad still smiling came back into the room as he came in danny called down from the top of the stairway gaby oh gaby she knows where gaby is going and whom she is going to meet and she too is afraid i decided because of the queer strained quality of her voice gaby has gone out i called in answer and then since i could still see gaby walking down the path do you want her danny we could fetch her back no danny answered don t bother i ll come down i had to reverse my first decision about danny s being frightened at least her voice was natural enough now i fancied perhaps a note of relief in it it couldn t have been more than ten minutes after that when martha came running into the house laughing and dancing and wearing the gold bracelet with the monkey clasp gaby she said had given it to her just now out by the rabbit hutch while we were all still exclaiming over the monkey and praising it up to please martha danny came downstairs she was freshly dressed and sweet smelling with the nice quiet flower scent she used but she looked really ill she said her headache was worse again and she drew the curtains at the windows beside the big davenport to ease the glare of the light before she curled up on it i thought it was a good time to continue the conversation we had begun the other evening danny i said as i sat down beside her if you just could tell john or sam or me what is troubling you i am pretty sure that we could find some way out bless your hearts she repeated you are all too good i am afraid i can t tell you what has been troubling me but i can tell you honestly that i think now the worst of the troubles are over they never were really mine you see they were gaby s and now gaby has decided to well stop being troubled we had a good long talk this afternoon she has made me some promises she is going to try to act differently to be good as she used to say when we were little she had a dreadful disappointment day before yesterday it made her act very badly at first she has decided now to make the best of it for there is a best of it to make you ve noticed how much better she acted last evening and all of to day she is making a fresh start you see she has even given martha her precious monkey i am sure we shall all be much happier from now on do you know where she was going this afternoon i asked for a little walk why did she wear her wrap and carry her beaded bag just to go out for a little walk danny sat up straight pressing her hands to her aching head her wrap to day her beaded bag surely not that s just what she did didn t you see her before she left i was lying down she came to my door and said that she was going for a walk and asked me if i cared to go with her i said that my headache was too severe she went into her room and from there downstairs i felt guilty about refusing to go with her after our talk i thought that i should so i called after her but when you said she had gone i was afraid she would be annoyed at being called back i had gotten up so since john will surely be home before long now i came down i can t understand her wearing a wrap it is so silly on a day like this it sounded all right but i was not quite satisfied i thought i said that when you called after her you were frightened or worried or something frightened no mary i had nothing to be frightened about gaby was frightened i said gaby she couldn t have been she was all right this afternoon nothing could have happened since then i don t know something was the matter with her when she walked through this room i ll go bond that wherever it was she was going she was afraid to go mary it must be that you are imagining this unless oh it couldn t be that gaby has not told me the truth about about anything i am sure she was honest with me this afternoon i am sure and yet dear me i wonder where she went for her walk she talked to chad just before she left maybe she told him where she was going danny called the question across the room to chad who was improvising cheerful happy music on the piano not a word chad spoke above his music except that she was going for a walk and didn t want my company gaby told me martha piped up from where she was sitting on the arm of sam s chair that she was going to the cabin she was in a big hurry she ran up toward the cabin danny questioned though we all knew we could not put a mite of trust in anything martha said yes chad loves me better n he loves her don t you chad you are positive danny insisted and i couldn t see why for a minute that she went to the cabin or toward it you aren t fibbing are you martha dear are you sure that she didn t go around the house toward the road when she asked about the road her meaning was clear to me danny was afraid that gaby had gone to meet john who should have been back from rattail before this but if she had hoped to get anything out of martha she had made a mistake in her questioning for anyone to accuse martha of a fib was to make her stick to it like a waffle to an ungreased pan she told me she was going to the cabin martha answered she ran she was in a hurry danny stood up i think i shall walk up to the cabin and see whether i can find her you ll come with me mary i said not in the heat besides it would soon be five o clock and time to be starting supper she asked mrs ricker to go with her mrs ricker refused i wondered why when neither of us would go danny did not go by herself she did not had she perhaps guessed at the cause of gaby s fear did she share it was she afraid to go to the cabin alone chapter xv one return at five o clock the men put up the chess board chad stopped playing the piano and the three of them went to the barns together i went into the kitchen to get supper danny in spite of her headache insisted upon helping me she did the best she could she managed to get the table set in between times when she was not running to the window to see whether john was coming at six o clock though neither john nor gaby had returned we sat down to supper danny was too nervous to touch a bit of food she kept looking out of the windows and at her watch and out of the windows again don t worry danny sam said john has had tire trouble on account of the heat they ll come riding up the road any minute now they she questioned gaby togged up and went down the road to meet john didn t she no danny s voice curled into a wail no uncle sam she didn t martha saw her going to the cabin didn t you martha martha mrs ricker astonished us all by saying doesn t know where gaby went she knows only where gaby told her she was going but why should gaby tell her a fib about it danny asked and why i questioned should gaby go around the house to get to the road instead of going right out the front way again mrs ricker shocked us by speaking she would not go out the front way if she wanted to keep her trip to the road a secret mrs ricker danny s voice trembled what are you hinting what is it that you know i know said mrs ricker that there is not a man living who is not as false as sin sam growled come down to facts mrs ricker if you have any i think it was the first time sam had ever spoken unpleasantly to her he betrayed his own anxiety by so doing it was easy to see that she was cut to the quick i have no facts she said except that right after dinner to day john and gaby had a private conversation and he decided very suddenly to go for the mail at that minute we heard a sound for sore ears the car coming up the driveway danny jumped up and ran to look out of the living room window he has gone all the way around to the kitchen she said when she came back if it had not been sort of pathetic showing how worried she had been her impatience at having to wait another minute or so to see him would have been funny she ran into the kitchen she and john came to the door of the butler s pantry john was gray with dust his brows were knitted as they are whenever he is troubled about anything he hasn t seen gaby danny announced with an exultation that showed plainly what she had been most anxious about he brought up the rock salt that s why he drove to the kitchen come and see mary i d rather see you two come and eat your suppers i said goodnight john answered i ve got to go and get rid of a few tons of dirt before i can come to the table no danny insisted never mind the dirt dear supper is all cold now please come and eat john patted her on the shoulder and smiled at her and manlike did as he pleased he went through the kitchen and upstairs the back way danny called after him asking him to hurry he didn t when he finally did come all slicked up and bathed and shaved he said it was too hot to eat and would have nothing but some ice cream sam asked him what had kept him so long on the trip john said tire trouble and that he had met leo saule two miles this side of rattail with his flivver broken down john had stopped to help him and at last had been forced to tow him the six miles north to his place john has a way when he is worried of shutting and opening his eyes and of tossing his head back and to the side with a quick little jerk as if he were trying to get shed of something that was in it all the while he was eating and talking he kept doing this i asked him whether his head ached no he said but i think i m sort of loco from being out in the sun gaby kept you waiting quite a while hubert hand stated and asked what do you mean john questioned waited for her down the road didn t you and took her to rattail in time to catch the train for reno or frisco i thought john would fly into a temper he has a handy temper but he only looked around at all of us with a bewildered expression and say are you fellows trying to put something over on me or what he asked then you don t deny hubert hand began sam who has enough dander for john and himself both when necessary broke in john doesn t have to deny anything marcus will be in the office now waiting for twenty one phone down phone s handy ask him whether he flagged twenty to day for a passenger or whether he is going to flag twenty one hubert went straight to the telephone from his end of the conversation we could tell that twenty had not stopped and that no one was waiting for twenty one he looked foolish when he turned from the telephone and said take it all back john my mistake sam looked mighty serious well he drawled i don t know but what as good a plan as any would be for us all to go out and have a look around for her oh danny exclaimed sharply uncle sam you do think that she has met with some mishap i think sam said that she has met with another machine and ridden off in it but better safe than sorry then we ll be fine and fit for the fireworks eh martha martha who had been drowsy all during supper was half asleep on the davenport and did not answer chapter xvi the murder sam s first plan after he and hubert had made a quick ride to the cabin and back with no sight of gaby was for the two of us to go down the road in the sedan fortunately he decided at the last minute to have john come with us to drive danny came along with john chad and hubert hand were to scout around the place on their ponies mrs ricker stayed at home with martha as soon as we had started sam said in a cocksure overbearing way he never has except when he is not as certain of himself as he d like to be we ll not have to go far not more than a mile i reckon to find the fresh tire tracks of the machine that came up here to meet her after the breeze and the shower this morning the fresh tracks will show up like mud on a new fence whoa what did i tell you see there tire tracks sure enough but they were the tracks made by the sedan patterned like a snake s back and showing plain as print on top of the dim tracks made by the outfit s departure for telko the morning before we rode along watching the four long trails two for john s trip to town and two for his trip back to the ranch the only breaks were the spots where as it was plain to be seen john had twice had tire trouble our road and it is that since sam had it graded himself and pays for having it kept up runs north straight as a string with sam s fields and fences on one side of it and sagebrush covered deserts on the other side of it for ten miles to where it joins the victory highway sam has a sign at the junction with the highway so no one has any reason for using this road unless he has business with the desert moon ranch we drove to the highway before we turned around we had come back about a mile when the wind that always ushers in a storm in these parts came howling up blowing the sand and dust in thick clouds jerking and snapping the sage and the greasewood chasing and bouncing the tumbleweed balls the sky turned black the thunder growled mean as a threat in the distance john drove fast but we barely made the ranch before the storm broke when we came out of the garage doors the first drops of rain big as butter cookies had begun to fall and just as we reached the front porch the rain came pouring down as if all the sky were the nozzle of a big faucet and someone had turned it on full force this will bring her in sam said as we ran up the steps she ll be there high and dry when we get in she was not chad and hubert hand had come in and they acted as if since we had set out to get news of gaby it was a wonder we had not done it martha was awake and sobbing because she could not have the fireworks mrs ricker was showing a little last minute sense by hurrying around and getting the house closed against the storm she should have done it when the wind first came up sam went and touched a match to the fire ready to be started in the fireplace i ran upstairs and closed the bedroom windows and turned the fans off i don t care for buzzing fans during one of our electrical storms i had come downstairs ready to take my rest when i remembered the attic with all its windows wide to the drenching rain my corns had been hurting me all day so chad being handy i asked him to go and close the attic he went up the stairs and almost at once came back to the head of them to call down that the attic door was locked one of my principles is that if you ask a man to do anything about the house for you you do it twice yourself i thought again how true that was as i went on my aching feet up the stairs to prove to him that the door was not locked never had been locked and likely never would be it was locked chad stood by pleased as punch when it would not give to my shaking and pulling he walked off saying that he would see whether someone downstairs had locked it and had the key or if not whether he could find another key to fit it i stood there waiting i put my hand in my pocket for my handkerchief there was a key it fitted the lock i opened the door about half way up the steps gaby was lying in a huddle of pink wrap her hat had fallen off i thought that she was asleep i spoke to her she did not answer i ran up the steps and put an arm around her trying to lift her her head rolled to one side i saw her throat it was saffron color with great blue black bruises at its base i touched her swollen face it was cold for an instant my only sensation was one of violent nausea i tried to scream my throat had closed i must have shut my eyes for i remember thinking that if i did not open them the dizziness would sweep me off into unconsciousness i opened them i saw there on the red carpet of the steps something that shocked my reeling senses into sanity dropped all over the bright beaded bag lying there were the burned tobacco and the ashes from sam s pipe all of my horror concentrated into a frantic desire to get those ashes cleared away so that no one else could see them i shook them from the bag to the carpet i brushed them from the carpet into my handkerchief just as i got to my feet from my knees chad came up call the others i said gaby is here murdered i stuffed the handkerchief filled with ashes into my pocket and for the first and last time in my life i fainted dead away chapter xvii suicide the next thing that i knew i was lying on my back listening to someone screaming above the voices of sam and mrs ricker i realized that those awful sounds were coming from my own throat i tried to stop them but i could not i put my hands to my throat to make it stop the noise sam s voice came clear and strong then real like a light in the dark i sat straight up the screams ceased what i managed is the matter everything on god s earth that could be sam answered but here mary drink this get some sleep nothing to be done now we ll need you to morrow some water mrs ricker he shook a powder into my mouth mrs ricker held a glass of water to my lips when i opened my eyes again it was gray dawn i saw that i was in mrs ricker s room she was sitting by the window tatting yes tatting darting the shuttle back and forth back and forth with her long white fingers i watched her for a full minute before memory seized me and i cried out with the pain of it sh h h she warned me in a whisper you ll wake martha she is asleep here on the couch i got out of bed shook my skirts down and fastened my corsets under my dress i felt in my pocket the ball of handkerchief was still there i went into the hall bathroom washed my face and hands and drained the last crumb of tobacco down with the water out of the wash bowl i washed the handkerchief scoured the bowl and went back to mrs ricker s room as i opened the door she again warned me against waking martha was the shock too much for her i asked going and standing beside mrs ricker so that we might talk in whispers she stopped to pick a knot out of her thread before she answered me i didn t allow her to go upstairs she followed chad out of the house and saw him shoot himself he died within ten minutes it was terrible for martha i had to hold her while sam gave her the narcotic no no i protested what what are you saying not chad what was it you said about chad he walked out and shot himself through the head she pulled the thread looser on her shuttle i rushed out of the room away from her i staggered down the stairs into the kitchen sam hubert hand and john all jumped up from their chairs and started toward me john reached me first and put an arm around me chad i began but i couldn t get any further there there mary pour her some coffee dad quick here sit here turn on that fan hand get some water no no tell me mrs ricker said it isn t true it it can t be true not our chad sam answered gruffly to keep the choke out of his voice it is a damn shame mary but it is true the boy shot himself not fifteen minutes after we found her wait he went on quickly before you think anything i want to tell you what i have told the others it is god s truth that poor boy is as innocent of any connection with the murder as i am sam i managed and hid my ugly twisted old face down in my arms i will say that the men did pretty well just sitting quiet and leaving me alone and letting me have my cry out it seemed to me i never was going to be able to stop but they didn t bother me with comforting they let me get clear through to the sniffling and swallowing stage i was the first one to speak what i said are we going to do we are going to do a lot mary sam said we are going to keep chad s name clean sure in answer to my protest we all know but just the same i m mighty thankful that i have his alibis for him myself a suicide looks bad you know that is it would until we find canneziano this is his work but sam i said if he wasn t let out of san quentin until yesterday morning he couldn t possibly have got way up here that same evening we ve told sam that a thousand times hubert hand said all right all right sam said but if i ever get that long distance call through you ll find that canneziano was released a day or two early she met him yesterday how d he get up here sam i questioned you remember there were no tracks on the road except the sedan tracks hubert hand snapped me short did you have a passenger up from rattail yesterday john sam spoke before john could answer son he said did you by any chance as a favor to one of the girls bring that skunk here yesterday i did not dad he got here then as i ve said all along horseback across the deserts and he murdered the girl by god he ll hang for it if it takes my last dollar he killed chad too as much as if he d shot him down we aren t overlooking a couple of murders not here on the desert moon not right yet she went out to meet him yesterday i tell you she brought him into the house for some purpose through the back way and up into the attic without anybody seeing or hearing them hubert hand questioned nobody was looking nor listening as i remember you know damn well that with the doors shut nothing can be heard from room to room in this house let alone upstairs to downstairs i tell you he killed her there on the stairs and he made his get away if you think that i said why aren t you out hunting him hell sam exploded why ain t i out hunting last night s lightning the girl had been dead anyway two or three hours more likely longer when we found her he had that head start on us and he could ride god how that skunk could ride no mercy for a horse he s gone he went straight across the deserts hell bent for sunday he ll need food he ll need water worse i ve telegraphed to every town within two hundred miles of here they are watching i ve phoned every ranch i ve kept that phone hot for six solid hours i ve got posses at every water hole listen sam i said you shouldn t have doped me up with that sleeping powder because unless after he murdered her he walked downstairs with none of us seeing or hearing him and into the living room or the kitchen and put the key in my pocket canneziano is not the guilty man sam s pipe fell out of his mouth i shivered during all of his talk i had clear forgotten about those pipe ashes dropped all over the beaded bag it was hubert hand who put the question to me about the key he made me feel guilty my explanation to them that the key had been in the pocket of my dress the dress i had been wearing since morning yesterday had the feeling of a confession still hubert hand said when i had finished that does not necessarily disprove sam s theory if canneziano was let out of prison in time to get here yesterday he could have murdered her as sam insists and he could have given the key to some one of us to put in your pocket chad for instance or no sam thundered that boy i tell you is as innocent as i am the telephone bell rang hubert hand and john followed sam into the living room i stayed where i was i had to have a minute to think the ashes on the bag the key in my pocket sam mary magin i told myself for twenty five years ever since sam stanley took you a snivelling pride broken deserted bride into his house and gave you a chance to make a life for yourself you have never seen him do a mean trick to man woman child or beast you never even heard of a questionable nor an unkind action of his and you never will for the simple reason that the ingredients for anything but honor and decency aren t in him if they were he would not be sam stanley any more than bean soup would be bean soup if it was made out of gooseberries and ginger that being the one certainty you have at this minute you had better hang on to it tight stop thinking and guessing keep your mouth shut and you won t go far wrong good resolutions are easy to make so is lemon meringue both are almost impossible to keep i went right on thinking if sam i thought had found it necessary to murder gabrielle canneziano he had probably done it to keep something worse from happening sickened at myself for that thought i found another way of thinking not much better it did seem to me remembering the pipe ashes on top of the bag that sam must have been there on the stairs at some time after she had been murdered and before i had found her he must then be keeping some secret concerning the murder it did look as if considering his talk he must be shielding the murderer with every ounce of his horse sense and ingenuity both of which he had in plenty but who would he shield to that extent chad alive or dead no martha yes but martha could not have done it john not unless there was something to it than one of us dreamed of hubert hand or mrs ricker no danny i thought not myself i couldn t be sure the men came back into the kitchen sam looked ten years older than he had looked ten minutes before it was san quentin he said to me canneziano was positively not released from there until nine o clock yesterday morning that i said lets him out and hubert hand said lets every man jack of us here on the place in habit was too strong for sam well in he quoted with a groan chapter xviii clarence pette the sheriff the coroner the undertaker a newspaper reporter and another man that the coroner had brought along for a juryman drove up to the ranch at five o clock that morning it had been past midnight before sam had been able to get hold of one of them at telko on account of them all being out taking in the celebration there sam and the sheriff had been friends for thirty years sam s money had paid for the coroner s medical education they and the others were mighty sorry to have to bother us at all and their sole aim was to make as little trouble as possible they interviewed each one of us alone but pleasantly and informally in the dining room each one that is but danny the coroner visiting her as a doctor said it would never do to pester her in the state she was in and martha who was still asleep and whom they said it was no use to wake they kept each of us about ten minutes they brought in the verdict of died by his own hand for chad and murdered by person or persons unknown for gaby they left on tiptoe holding their hats in their hands clear to the end of the driveway the coroner and the sheriff both came i think with the conviction that chad was the guilty person but sam was so right down violent about chad s innocence that they let that drop at once the sheriff left i am all but certain with the strong conviction that i had committed the murder and with the resolution that he would not do sam an ill turn by depriving him of a good cook the coroner and the others except the reporter were sure i think that one of us was guilty but were thankful to goodness that they had not found out which one the undertaker did not leave with the others he was preparing the bodies to take them to telko there to await the instructions that we could not give until after we had gotten in touch if possible with chad s people and had come to a decision about gaby s burial place the reporter whose name not that it matters except for its fitness was clarence pette waited to return to town with the undertaker while waiting he went snooping about the place looking for footprints there could not have been any after the deluge of rain the night before cocking his head to one side and the other writing in a notebook making knowing humming sounds between his tightly closed lips he had been bothering me like a fly on the ceiling all morning finally when he came poking right into my kitchen and opened the door to the back stairway i turned on him what s the matter with you i asked if you have any business why don t you go about it yes yes he said precisely now my good woman if you can spare me a few moments sam came ambling into the kitchen and threw himself into a chair ah mr stanley clarence said i was just telling your cook here that if she could spare me a few moments of her time i probably could be of much service here under these unfortunate circumstances you see we reporters are necessarily detectives in a smaller or greater degree until i came to nevada i was on one of the large san francisco dailies not taking undo credit to myself i will say that while serving there i was instrumental in getting to the bottom of numerous crimes have i your attention mr stanley sam looked at him as he would look at some snapping puppy that was pestering around his heels i don t know what clarence thought what he said was precisely by mere observation trained observation that is coupled with a naturally analytical and deductive mind and imagination observation first as an example since entering this kitchen i have observed that your cook if you mean mrs magin sam interrupted say so precisely i have observed that mrs magin has been but recently divorced she was married to a man of some property of this she received a share at the time of her divorce in lieu of further alimony she has come here recently from chicago where she lived in comfort but not in luxury she did not keep a servant her daughters were dutiful girls all of her children at the time of the divorce however sided with their father i glanced at sam he was resting his head in his hands elbows on the table he had not i could tell heard one word that clarence had said to my own discredit at an hour like that i was curious to find out how a man could make so many mistakes in so short a time but how i began he was too eager to explain to allow me to finish the question very simple for a trained observer you no longer wear a wedding ring but the mark of one worn for years shows plainly on your finger my wedding ring is set around with garnets so i always take it off when i cook and hang it on a nail for that purpose over the sink it was hanging there in plain sight right then if you were a widow you would continue to wear your ring your clothes your wrist watch your silk stockings show that you have been accustomed to a comfortable living since you came to nevada it was you who got the divorce hence alimony had you received a lump sum of money or monthly payments you would not have taken a position as a cook you undoubtedly received property on which you can not at once realize your kitchen apron here on the hook and like the one you are wearing has the label of a chicago firm in its waistband and is of excellent material had you been poor you could not have afforded such an apron more than likely you would have made your own aprons had you been wealthy you would not have owned a kitchen apron it is easy to tell from watching you that you have been accustomed to having help in your work hence your daughters if your children had been in sympathy with you at the time of the divorce you undoubtedly would have returned to make your home with one of them instead of remaining as a cook in nevada sam who had shifted his position stretched and crossed one leg over the other interrupted oh dry up young fellow he said as if the sound of clarence s voice had tuckered him clear out clarence tittered embarrassment i think made him do it and take yourself and your laughing out of here sam said if you need to be told that this isn t a place for laughing this morning i m telling you now but mr stanley i assure you never mind just get on out of here that s all as you say i shall report to my paper shall i that the millionaire owner of the desert moon ranch is apparently undesirous of having the murderer discovered report what you damn please to your paper sam answered but get out of here that was all right for the nevada papers where sam was known but if the other papers copied the news i didn t care to have that impression of sam strewn all over the country it never did do any harm i reckoned to have the press on your side so with sam glaring at me i cozied clarence up a bit told him to sit down and have some pie and coffee while he ate i flattered his vanity by asking whether he had formed any opinions concerning the murder opinions no he said pulling back his chin for dignity theories yes theories i may say that i have arrived at quite independently since the testimony at the inquest was without value observation trained observation and a certain instinct that might almost be described as clairvoyance for instance the contents of the bead bag carried by the victim apparently rather damning evidence there against mr hand also apparently other valuable clues pouff he made a gesture of blowing the beaded bag and its contents off the palm of his white hands since this was the first i had heard of the bag s contents i was sorry to have them dismissed so airily i let it pass not wishing to question him even the coroner and the other members of the jury untrained as they were realized i am sure that all that was too obvious a murderer my good woman leaves clues but not obvious ones the contents of that bag were probably arranged by the murderer after the murder had been committed by someone moreover who had access to the victim s personal belongings regard this please as a suggestion merely does it occur to you that it is peculiar that a young woman who was unable to meet the coroner s jury should in the next hour be able to arise and assist the undertaker is danny up i questioned sam teetering around like a sick little ghost mrs ricker went to ask her about what dress to put on gaby and nothing would do danny but that she get right up and help to lay gaby out you see nothing extraordinary in that clarence persisted sam made another profane request concerning clarence s drying up well i said she is her twin sister you know and she is a loving hearted unselfish little thing i reckon she thought it would be the last service true true but the victim was last seen at the side of the house near the rabbit hutch suppose that as soon as she had gotten rid of the child by giving her the bracelet the victim had at once re entered the house through the back way and had gone at once up these back stairs miss danielle canneziano was upstairs at the time was she not alone i remembered danny coming downstairs not more than fifteen minutes after gaby had gone through the room i remembered how fresh and sweet she had been and how untroubled except for her headache a dozen defenses for danny who needed none flashed through my mind i should not have deigned to use one of them to clarence but unthinkingly i did if you are hinting at danny i said she had neither the time nor the strength if she d had a year she wouldn t have done it and couldn t have with those frail little hands of hers in my opinion clarence returned that job took science rather than strength it took fingers that knew how to find the windpipe and the carotid artery at the same instant the japs understand that grip perfectly an occidental might stumble onto it by accident but granted your objection that strength was required the young woman might have had an accomplice one who filled with remorse killed himself or one who in tense excitement dropped the key into her own pocket i gasped sam rose he took hold of clarence at the back of his collar and at the back of his trousers and began pushing him toward the door sam s first remark won t do to repeat his second was and now you blithering fool if you publish one of your filthy lying insinuations against that little grief stricken sister or against our dead boy or against mrs magin just one in that rotten dirty sheet of yours you won t be in nevada long enough to get your divorce sam boosted him out through the doors all the nevada newspaper accounts made much of the fact that the fiend who had committed the terrible murder on the desert moon ranch had made a complete escape without leaving any clues of any sort chapter xix the note no clues land s alive the place was positively cluttered with clues and most of them about as useful in the end as clutter generally is i am not saying that none of them were of value i am saying that a person out in a grove of aspen trees all bending and bowing to a high wind would be sort of simple to go hunting a straw to find which way the wind was blowing that was about how sensible i was when i asked sam after he had got shed of clarence about the contents of gaby s beaded bag it is all on the table in her room he said where i put it for the coroner s jury you can go and see but first read this it was tucked inside her dress the undertaker found it and gave it to me i dread giving it to danny he handed me a folded sheet of paper i opened it and read danny dear if you ever read this i shall be dead murdered don t have me buried here in this god forsaken country take me to san francisco and have my body cremated i love a flame i hate the cold earth you have had much trouble on my account old dear don t blame me for having kept the fear and the dread of this thing which i felt certain was going to happen from you you nor no living person but one could have saved me remember dan that in spite of all the distress i have caused you and may still be causing you i have always in my own way loved you gaby sam i said i knew she was afraid yesterday oh why didn t she tell us of course you men could have saved her why did she go out alone to meet that fiend sam s only answer was a slow shaking of his bowed head and a deep sigh mary he said then will you give this note to danny and explain to her how it is how what is i mean well she can t leave the desert moon now to take the body to frisco until we find out who murdered that girl not a man jack of us is going to leave this place for any reason sam stanley i gasped you can t refuse that s all own twin sisters and danny as innocent as a new born babe don t talk like a book mary danny may be as innocent as she seems to be and she may not she nor anyone else can leave this place until we have gotten to the very bottom of this thing that goes to think you paid attention to that fool reporter don t be a fool yourself sam urged this note in gaby s handwriting clears danny of the crime if all the other evidence didn t which it does we know that she did not kill her sister but of all the people in this house she is in the best position to know who did do it of course if she is involved in this she is involved innocently if she put the key in your pocket while we were out in the car she did it with no idea of what she was doing just the same i want her right here on the desert moon for a while mary you take the note to her and explain in your nice way i ll give her the note sam i said but you ll have to do the explaining yourself i ll tell you why it isn t right for you to try to protect anyone not even martha to the extent of refusing to allow one sister to carry out the dying request of another sister sam dropped his pipe as i saw the tobacco and the ashes scatter i was more certain than ever that i was acting as a decent women should the door opened and danny came in she was so pale that her cheeks had sort of a greenish tinge to them great dark circles spread far down under her eyes that were red and swollen from crying i hurried to her and put my arms around her she clung to me and hid her head on my shoulder and said my name over and over sam turned away as if he could not bear to look at us i took her into the living room and sat down in a big chair and held her in my lap if only she kept saying if only she could have left us in her beauty she was so beautiful mary and now remembering what i had seen the night before i knew that i must get her mind into other channels if her reason was to be saved i thanked my stars when i remembered the note after she had read it she cried harder than ever but i knew that it was crying of a saner sort will you go with me mary she questioned when she had quieted some to san francisco we ll have to talk to sam about that dear i said it was the habit of helping him not any kindly impulse that made me continue i am afraid that sam wants us all to stay here for a while there there dear you see how it is don t you sam thinks that the duty of each one of us right now is to stay here and help try to find the guilty person does uncle sam think we will find him here she questioned i tried to tell myself that i had been mistaken that she had not emphasized sam s name in a hard pointed way as she had seemed to do there isn t anywhere else to try to find him i said did you know about the key in my pocket she nodded i knew about that she said what else did you know about i asked a mite sharply for there was no mistaking her emphasis this time nothing she said hurriedly nothing but mary doesn t it seem possible to you that someone clear from the outside did it and gave the key to chad and asked him to put it in your pocket and that for some reason we probably never shall discover chad could not dared not tell on the person who gave it to him and that that is why he shot himself and we hadn t thought of that i gasped i do believe it it is as clear as day her sudden definite silence talked as plainly as any words she could have spoken danny i questioned you thought of that but in your heart you don t believe it do you i i want to believe it she evaded but you don t i persisted she was silent danny i pleaded tell me about it just tell me dear i ll never breathe it to a soul if you say for me not to what is it that you know or think that you know she waited so long before answering me that i thought surely she was finding the words with which to take me into her confidence i was so disappointed i could have cried with her when she hid her face on my shoulder again and moaned mary i can t i dare not tell i tell you i dare not she jumped up out of my lap and ran upstairs as if wicked dangerous things were running after her chapter xx a confession john came into the room the outfit is back or most of it he said darn their souls curiosity nothing else but for this they wouldn t have shown up for two days yet i think the women went into the kitchen just now mary there they were belle sadie and goldie all huddled up together like a bunch of something near the back door as i came into the room they jumped and screeched the only thing that makes me madder than being scared myself is to scare somebody else i spoke to them right sharply i told them that i expected them to go about their work and to act like sensible girls while so doing i told them that we had enough to put up with just now without adding a parcel of jumping squealing girls to our load sadie the sauciest of the lot on account of imagining that being married made her more independent than the other girls spoke up we haven t decided yet that we want a go workin in a house where a murderer and maybe moren one is livin if that s the way you feel about it i said the sooner you leave the better it is an honor to work in the desert moon ranch house and you know it maybe tis maybe tain t sadie sauced back you ll not get girls as easy to day as you would of yesterday murders and suicides if it was a suicide don t do much in makin a ranch pop lar for help very well i said if you are going go now if not put on your aprons and get to work i could scarcely believe my eyes the three of them skedaddled out through the door i felt sort of sick watching them go not because i d have to teach new girls the work and my ways but because their leaving gave me my first realization that the desert moon ranch was darkened by the shadow of sin that the eclipse i had feared was upon us when i telephoned to sam down in his office in the outfit s quarters i tried to keep the truth from him saying only that the girls and i had had a spat and asking him to find some new girls for me he came up in about half an hour with an indian girl not more than fifteen years old trailing along behind him answering his nod i went with him into the living room she is the only one i could get he said we ll have to send to reno or salt lake none of the outfit want their women folks working here i don t blame them the desert moon ranch is disgraced he stopped short i thought that it was because he could not bear to go on with what he had begun to say until following his eyes i saw that he was looking at a piece of paper on the writing desk just in front of him it had been propped up against a vase but it had slithered down into a curve he reached for it read it and handed it to me i killed her chadwick caufield p s sorry to put you to the trouble of disposing of me make it cheap and snappy i haven t a relative in the world p g a lie sam said i think so i know damn well it is i tell you she had been dead two or three hours anyway probably longer when we found her listen mary between four and five o clock we all saw her alive at four chad sat right there at that piano and he never left it once did he no he didn t i kept thinking he would to join gaby but he didn t between five and six o clock sam went on he was with me every minute of the time down in the barn and coming up to the house never out of my sight between six and seven he was with us all at supper if he d been gone all afternoon i d know that note was a lie know it just as well as i know it now but why did he shoot himself then sam god knows he thought he loved her but this note a confession why would he die in disgrace when we know he was innocent god knows to shield someone else i reckon who sam dropped his pipe i heard him stamping the sparks out i did not look down i did not want to look down chapter xxi a summons it might be sam said as he refilled his pipe that chad did not write this i ll send it with some of his other writing to one of these handwriting experts i ve read about he wrote it i said the writing is his so is the wording you know it i looked at him straight i felt something tighten around my heart as if it had been roped by a professional i guess i was too sentimental but i couldn t bear to see sam s good old face all aching with worry sam i wheedled have sense we ve a confession here that will satisfy the world he killed her and when the body was found he shot himself nothing could be more reasonable no one would doubt it we can send this to the papers he has no relatives to be disgraced or to sorrow over it and the desert moon will be cleared of crime one of your favorite sayings sam is to let well enough alone sam drew himself up to the top of his six feet and five inches and looked down from there at me away down as far say as if i had suddenly dropped into a dirty old cistern there is no question of well enough he shouted so that i could hear him in my depths until the desert moon is cleaned clean mary magin cleaned and fumigated or destroyed it is not going to be whitewashed there is someone on this ranch who is as guilty as hell who knows who committed the murder who aided and abetted it we are going to find that person then we will find the murderer they ll be hung together after that we can leave well enough alone suppose i suggested that chad was the accomplice i reckon he said growing suddenly kind that you ve been through too much mary that s it you aren t quite responsible to day i don t wonder but reason with me mary somebody suggested already to day that it was chad who put the key in your pocket when did he get the key to put it there well say that he got it between seven and eight o clock when he was out scouting by himself did he meet some entire stranger then who asked him to dispose of the key did he agree to do it as a favor to said stranger did he later shoot himself and leave a lying confession to shield the stranger the stranger that is who had killed the girl chad loved chad did carry some secret to the grave with him mary i am sure of that but not a secret that we can t discover we are going to discover it to doubt sam standing there before me talking so earnestly to me to doubt his honesty of purpose and his goodness was more than a question of doubting my eyes my ears my senses for the moment it would have been to doubt the things that had made up my life for the past twenty five years it would have swept away all of my accumulated certainties all of my conclusions all of my standards as a wind sweeps trash from the desert it would have uprooted me and it would have left me as aimless and as wind tossed as tumbleweeds sam i began resolved to tell him then and there about those pipe ashes of his on the beaded bag i had waited too long mrs ricker was coming down the stairs i think she said that martha should not sleep so late i fear that she is sleeping too heavily it is a blessing that she can sleep sam said she is all right those sleeping powders are as powerful as all get out i got them from a doctor in frisco when i was down there last year and they made me sleep when i had neuralgia i m going up though i ll have a look at her by the way he added from the stairway i want you two ladies to be here in this room at promptly three o clock this afternoon upon my soul i said when sam was out of sight what do you suppose that means i might have spared my breath she did not answer but she did something downright unusual for mrs ricker she looked at me and as i met her look it seemed to me that there was a pleading expression in her face as if were she able to talk she d like to ask me to do something for her i have seen dogs look like that at times what is it mrs ricker i questioned she shook her head and walked to the windows and turned her back on me i looked at the straight gaunt back and at her long arms hanging at her sides she seemed frail and yet she could hold martha still when martha was in one of her tantrums and that was more than i a much stouter woman could do she with no one but martha who did not count had been alone in the house for an hour the evening before while the others of us had been out hunting for gaby sam insisted that gaby had been dead two or three hours when we found her but was he certain of that how did he know might he be mistaken mrs ricker had hated gaby as only a jealous woman can hate chapter xxii the pact all the while i was getting a make shift dinner ready that last thought of mine kept bothering me like the smell of something burning so as soon as dinner was over i need not have bothered with it everyone straggled in and straggled out again without doing any justice to good food mrs ricker and martha did not even come down i told the indian girl whose name was zinnia to manage the dishes the best she could and i went off up to my room i took up some dinner on a tray with me for mrs ricker and for martha when mrs ricker opened her door i managed to get the information that martha was awake at last and that mrs ricker had just been helping her with her bath is she all right now i questioned i suppose so she edged the door shut in my face i went into my room and combed my hair i can always think better when i am doing some absolutely unimportant thing like that but to day it was as if someone had put an egg beater into my mind and was beating it to best time my thoughts whirred and tossed and foamed sam s pipe ashes the key in my pocket chad s suicide chad s note of confession gaby s fear mrs ricker alone in the house what it was that danny knew and dared not tell not all plainly and separately as they look in writing but all jumbled and each one seething with its own details and complications sam s pipe ashes lands alive what had been the matter with me sam was the only member of our household who smoked a pipe but he was not the only man in creation who did nor was his the only pipe i supposed that had ever dropped and spilled its contents a very nice and comforting thought if i could have fooled myself into believing it try as i might i couldn t keep from thinking that part of sam s talk was bluff that is soon as i got away from him i thought that did it mean that he was trying to shield chad no it could not mean that besides chad himself had surely been trying to shield someone sam gaby had feared someone when she had left the house no woman had ever feared sam mrs ricker had hated gaby but so had john hated gaby mrs ricker had said john had said i jumped to my feet holding my head in my hands it seemed to me that the only decent thing i could do since it held my brainpan was to wrench the disloyal thing off and sling it away how dared i think such thoughts of people with whom i had spent the best part of my life they were the only friends i had in the world i had never seen one of them do an unkind thing never mrs ricker was as queer as dick s hatband but she had always been gentle and patient she had always been the first to spread crumbs on the snow for the birds in winter though of course she had said to hubert hand i was off again i could not endure the thinking of such thoughts i must stop it i must find work to do someone to talk to i ran across my room and pulled open the door just in time to see hubert hand straighten from where he had been stooping to my keyhole he brazened it out sorry mary but i guess it will be dog kill dog around here from now on hubert hand i said what i want to know is why are you listening at my keyhole i wasn t listening i was looking or trying to this keyhole peering is the bunk mary you might as well cut it out yourself with that he turned and walked on down the hall i stood watching him trying to account for an odd sense of relief that had come to me in a minute i understood since he had been at my keyhole he must have had some suspicion of me for something possibly he had a good reason for that suspicion as good a reason as i had for suspicioning sam and john and mrs ricker he was clear off the track with his suspicion probably i was just as far off with mine he turned quickly and came back to me he looked up and down the hall he lowered his voice to just above a whisper mary he said i ve gone at this all wrong i m off my nut to day that s all i ve discovered that i well i guess i cared a lot more for the girl than i thought i did by god i believe i loved her it is hell having her clear gone but my hanging for her murder isn t going to do her any good not now horrified i backed away from him for one wild moment i thought that the man was confessing to me no he said not that i swear to god i m innocent but they are going to try to pin it on me and they may not have much trouble doing it i want to make a bargain with you you ll get the best of it for i know damn well that i m innocent and i don t think that you are entirely it is this if you ll keep your mouth shut i ll keep mine shut fifty fifty will you do it hubert hand i said i don t know one solitary thing about you that would be of any importance if i told it to the world anything that you think you know about me i m glad and willing to have you broadcast or publish in the papers sure of that sure you are willing to have me broadcast that you found the body that you didn t scream that you stayed there quiet and alone with it for ten minutes before you gave the alarm fool that i was i said it wasn t nearly ten minutes it wasn t more than four or five he smiled i saw what i had done it took me that long to discover the truth i thought she was asleep i had to run up the steps double fool to try to explain say it took you a minute to run up a few steps another minute to discover that she was dead should it take you three or four minutes to run down again and give the alarm i was sick stunned dizzy with horror probably any jury would believe that all right just the same i ll bet it would save you a lot of trouble now and later if no one knew anything about your lonesome five minutes or longer i ll tell you how i know i came out of my room at the minute you opened the attic door i saw you leave the hall to run up the steps i went on downstairs chad was kidding around down there collecting keys i didn t know what he wanted with them fortunately for you or i d have said you d gotten the door open i interrupted with a new and it seemed to me a clever idea what you are forgetting i said is that i fainted dead away gosh mary but you are a rotten liar don t try it sam and i both saw you totter and go down just as we got to the top of the stairs after chad had shrieked the news down at us that was close to fifteen minutes after i d seen you open the door and and i couldn t keep my teeth from chattering you think i killed her then rot she had been dead for hours rigor was complete no all i think is that you were trying to cover someone maybe all that i know is that you know more than you are telling i did tell you i was frozen stiff with horror all right tell the jury tell them too why you came rushing out of your room as you did just now white and trembling don t like your thoughts all by your lonesome do you come on mary be a sport we are both innocent but fifty fifty shut mouth for shut mouth his talk about telling a jury scared me i had heard of third degrees i knew that if i ever told anyone but sam himself about those pipe ashes the words would choke the life out of me as i would want them to do dog kill dog then he asked hubert hand i m going to be honest with you i don t know what it is you want me to keep my mouth shut about don t well i want you to keep still about that conversation you overheard between ollie ricker and me in the cabin she went back to get her parasol and saw you coming out we knew you had been hiding there in the closet listening with the sense i had been showing it is a wonder i didn t speak right up and tell him that i had not been in the closet but in the chest i did not lands alive i said i d had no idea of telling that anyway it was none of my business fine i didn t have any idea of telling anything either it was none of my business shake on it i let him take my hand i said yes when he made me promise i felt like i d been associating with a sidewinder i went on down the hall wracking my brain to remember exactly what i had heard in the cabin mrs ricker s threat that would incriminate her not him and though the threat had proven of itself that she was in love with him i had certainly come away with no idea that he was in love with her his mention of a previous attempt at murder made by her again that was nothing against him no what he was afraid of having told must have been said in the room with the closet i found slight but some comfort in realizing that though i had probably been a fool to make the promise to him he had probably been a worse fool when he made the one to me chapter xxiii an omen as i was trying to hurry past gaby s door danny opened it and asked me if i would come in and sit with her for a while i should have been there long before i went right in apologizing and trying to explain but when i saw that she meant for us to sit in gaby s room i suggested that we go somewhere else no please mary she said i don t want to be alone but i do want to sit here i feel as if here with all her things around me i might get in touch i mean something might come to me they say you know that people who have died violent deaths do not leave the earth sphere at once i don t know whether i believe that or not but it could be true if she is still on earth she would come here wouldn t she and she would try i am sure to give me a sign something to help me to help all of us if it should come i want to be here to receive it it won t come danny dear i said no i suppose not she leaned back in her chair and sighed and her arms dropped straight down over the chair s arms a position that showed how tuckered she was the engagement ring that john had given her slipped from her finger and came rolling over toward me i scrambled to pick it up when i rose from the floor she had jumped to her feet she was ashy shaking and trembling as if she had a chill mary promise me that you ll never tell that not to anyone it didn t it couldn t mean anything it means i said handing her the ring that you are wasting away you d better let me go down and bring you up some good hot soup or an eggnog she clung to me don t leave me mary i am afraid i am dreadfully afraid promise that you won t tell about the ring it didn t mean anything i will admit that i did not like it any too well myself there just as she was asking for a sign the ring which had fitted snugly enough i had thought had dropped off but of course i had to put up a brave front to her nonsense i said i won t tell anybody because it is nothing to tell all that it means is that the ring is too large for you it is too large she agreed i ve been losing weight lately i have meant to ask john to send it to have it cut down but i hated to be without it still just as i was asking for a sign though it has dropped off several times before this i shouldn t think it meant anything this particular time should i of course not dear i said relieved to hear that it had dropped off before you had your hands hanging straight down that s all you are all overstrung and no wonder anyway what could it have meant how a person will babble along seemingly for no reason i had paid no attention to what i was saying but the minute i had said it the question needed an answer it could have meant that gaby did not want danny to marry john or since nothing in the house could have signified john s name as plainly as that ring could it might have meant i refused to go on with it danny must have been answering the question to herself as i had been doing she sat down in a deep chair opposite me her hands clasped on her knees and leaned forward and looked into my eyes definite things mary she said are always so wise a definite answer to your definite question proves as nothing else might have that this was a silly futile little accident the ring has dropped off i suppose half a dozen times this week gaby s last note to me was all affection living if gaby could have taken john away from me for herself she would have done it dead she wants us to marry i know that as for any other implication as i had done and in spite of her talk about definite things she refused that if only uncle sam were not so heartless she finished heartless i spoke sharply in spite of myself if the creator ever made a man with a bigger heart than sam stanley s nobody ever saw him he has been good to you she said but you give him his own way about everything well after all i said he does own the desert moon and everyone on it body and soul she said sometimes i think he owns everyone in this county i did not want to know what she meant by that so i only reminded her that sam was john s father her voice when she spoke next came muffled from where she had hidden her face in her curved arm on the back of the chair uncle sam is not john s father she said what do you mean by that john is uncle s adopted son they are so different so utterly different they could not be father and son maybe not i said trying to keep pleasant for i did not want to be snapping at the poor child on this day but no real son ever loved his father better than john loves sam he all but worships him and he has ever since he was a little fellow i know i know sometimes i think john cares more for uncle than he does for me mary tell me honestly do you think john loves me as much as he loves uncle sam it is hard to explain but ever since we had begun to speak of sam i had had a fighting feeling as if i were warding off danger so i was right down relieved to have the conversation take this silly turn love i told her though mercy knows i know little enough about it can t be measured with a pint cup like flour but john is a good normal boy that means that his sweetheart comes first with him first and last i don t know she answered i should hate to have john have to choose between uncle and me that is foolish talk why should john ever have to choose between you and sam she sighed and shook her head a sudden certainty came to me whatever it was that danny had refused that morning to tell me whatever it was that she had said that she dared not tell had had something somehow to do with sam i did not urge her again to tell me what it was i did not wish to know i sat there dumb trying to think of some decent excuse that would take me away from her and from that room and from the need of fighting fighting not in a fog but the fog itself trying to fell nothingness with a blow trying to catch smoke in a trap my dull wits worked too slowly she began again to speak chapter xxiv clues what i can not understand she said is that gaby knew that she might be killed and yet so far as anyone knows she did not do one thing to save herself if only only she had confided in me surely i could have found some way to help her to save her you know dear i said i think that gaby was not well at least not doing any clear thinking those last few days i know i thought it was only her disappointment but now who could be quite sane with such a fear confronting her yet she left all of her things in order as if deliberately she prepared for death she burned her papers and letters see danny pointed to the fireplace i crossed the room and looked into it papers had recently been burned there i took the poker and stirred in the fluttering black bits but nothing had escaped the flames i hung the poker back in the rack with shovel and tongs and bellows it did not catch on its hook as i bent to fix it i saw a little white circle down in the corner of the stand i stooped and picked it up it was a tiny round of celluloid with the letter q printed on it it is one of the caps for her typewriter keys danny replied to my question she put them on over the keys softer for her finger tips or saved her finger nails something of the sort i wonder why she burned them i said do you think that she did well this one being here on the hearth it probably rolled there sometime when she was taking them off her machine why did she take them off if she always used them i don t know shall we i suggested look and see whether the others are where she kept them danny opened the desk drawer they aren t here at any rate she said and came back to me and reached out her hand for the little cap and turned it over in her fingers it could mean only she said what we knew before that she expected death that she tried to leave everything tidy and in order i don t know i objected it seems more than orderly to have taken these off the machine and burned them it seems right down queer she smiled a little pitying smile at me and patted my shoulder poor mary she said well i tried to defend myself in all the mystery stories that i ever read it was always some stray meaningless little thing that solved the mystery in the end a criminal never was discovered without any clues was he i believe she said that you are the only one in the house who hasn t looked at what gaby had in her bag she walked to the table by the window i followed her i dreaded seeing that bag again but i was curious about its contents it was lying limp on the table she picked it up brushed it flickeringly with the tips of her fingers and blew on it as if she were trying to blow something off of it everything she explained sticks to the little pointed beads i took it from her and looked at it closely but i could see no speck of ash no minute particle of tobacco nor of dust on its pattern of parrots tree branches and flowers it is a beautiful thing i said gaby got it in vienna i ve wondered i said why it was that gaby had all the beautiful expensive things such as this your clothes are pretty and tasty but they aren t near the quality of gaby s she hesitated a moment before answering i have been in england for the past eight years while gaby has been on the continent where beautiful things are more plentiful and cheaper lands alive i thought you girls had lived together all these years no she said and picked up gaby s cigarette case and handed it to me it was made of a dull gold with her monogram g c set in tiny black opals with green and blue lights flickering in them as if they were alive i opened the case it was full of cigarettes except for a space at one side where about two of the pesky little things would have fitted in and see danny said opening the gold match box that was like the cigarette case it is quite empty it doesn t seem reasonable that she would start out with an empty match box i believe that she used the matches to smoke the cigarettes she wouldn t have used a box of matches to light two cigarettes she may have shared her matches with another person who was smoking likely she had only a few of these short matches i said sam would use about as many matches as that box would hold to get rid of one pipeful of tobacco i picked up another little gold box it had powder rouge lipstick and a mirror in it i had seen it often enough before i put it back on the table and took up a beaded coin purse that matched the large bag it was entirely empty isn t it queer that that should be empty danny asked and her bill fold is missing she surely would not start to go anywhere with not a cent of money doesn t it look as if she had been robbed only i said if anyone had robbed her why would he have left the valuable gold cigarette case and vanity case and match box he might have thought they would be hard to dispose of i stood silent thinking and shaking my head mary danny s voice always low grew lower still with her intensity there is one thing that no one has thought of daniel canneziano could have reached here from california in a few hours by aeroplane i had thought of that but danny no aeroplane ever came within twenty miles of the ranch without every man jack of us hearing it and rushing out with our heads tipped back to gape at it aeroplanes aren t stealthy things you know that people can slip up in and slip off again but on the third of july two aeroplanes passed over going to the telko celebration on the third i reminded her as advertised and you know how much noise they made and how we all went out and watched them from tiny specks in the south until they were tiny specks and lost in the north again she shook her head and drooped her shoulders with a sigh i picked up a little red handkerchief it was crumpled in a ball if ever i saw a handkerchief that had been cried into and turned to a dry spot and squeezed and cried into again it was that little red wad it was dry now of course exposed to the air in this altitude i wondered whether it had been dry when it had come out of the bag it was a question not to be asked so i dropped the handkerchief on the table certain only that the fastidious gabrielle had never started out with a handkerchief in that condition in her vienna bag and picked up the carved ivory cigarette holder it fell to pieces in my fingers was this broken in her bag i questioned yes snapped in two and she loved it i fitted the pieces together again on the table and took up a folded sheet of paper and opened it and read glorious gaby be a good sport be a darling be game that is be gaby and meet me this afternoon around four thirty in the cabin h h well i said yes i know danny answered but hubert hand swears that he wrote that note several weeks ago too we know that he was playing chess with uncle sam at half past four he could have gone to the cabin later when the men went to do the chores or was he right with sam and chad all the time i suppose so he must have satisfied the coroner s jury at the inquest of his innocence mary her voice went all tense again does it seem to you that the jury was very readily satisfied perhaps this would be as good a place as any to explain that this tale is not being written to prove that mary magin was or is a wise clever or smart woman as i have said before and will say again from the beginning to the very end i was a fool i made mistakes over and over and as will be told i made a disastrous mistake in the end if i had been blind deaf and dumb i could not have been as big a fool for then all the time i should not have been imagining that i saw things which i did not see heard things which i did not hear and i should have been obliged to keep my clattery old tongue quiet the only virtue i can claim concerning this story is that if i were a vain or a conceited person i should never have written it i spoke sharply too sharply to her in answer to what i had imagined i had seen in her attitude never mind about the jury being easily satisfied sam is not going to be he told me this morning that he would find the murderer if it took every dollar he had in the world to do it sam is going to get to the bottom of this be sure of that i wonder she said what do you wonder mary she exclaimed close to a reproach i merely wonder whether or not uncle sam will succeed i looked at her brown eyes all red and swollen from tears and at the deep dark circles under them and i was ashamed chapter xxv more clues i put my arm around her shoulders and drew her close to me honey i said forgive your old mary we are all overstrung overwrought i didn t mean to speak so sharply there is nothing to forgive dear she said but i don t understand what did i say or do that made you feel like being cross to me nothing i told her i m all on edge that s all i know were you looking for something else on the table there was nothing else in her bag i was wondering i said about that foreign looking letter she got on the second of july did she burn it with the other things oddly she didn t i found it in her desk or rather beneath her typewriter either she forgot about it or knew that none of us could read it it was written in a foreign language no in code here it is code indeed when i took it from its envelope this is what met my eyes paexzazlytp f y nyx ogrgrsgo rn fgao atf jan j asn ahzgo zkg c ahhalo vkgt nyx clplzgf rg lt zkg kypulzae zkaz nyx palf vlzk nyxo lrlzazgf r yta e lpa prleg p yoon yef fgao l rafg i have copied only the first lines on the first page there were four sleazy pages all closely typewritten not a scratch of handwriting on it what i judged to be the signature was slrsl do you know who wrote this i asked i am sure if i dare be sure of anything that it was written by a man named lewis bauermont i counted the letters of lewis on my fingers five the number of letters in the signature slrsl if he signed his name lewis i said then s would be l and l would be e and so on get a pencil dear let s see if we can work it out she came and looked over my shoulder at the jumbled letters no she said you see the letter s comes twice in the last word and there are no duplicate letters in lewis i am sure it will be more difficult than any substitution of letters i don t know anything about codes but i have a notion that the letters are mere symbols of something else numbers perhaps that work out with a key quotation i m going to have a try at my idea anyway i insisted i went and sat at the desk she sat beside me and handed me a pencil perhaps i suggested the man who wrote this signed some nickname did he have one men called him mexico and mexie gaby never used either of those names for him what name did she use i insisted though i felt like a brute none except lewis that i know of she didn t read the signature when she read the letter to me at least i don t remember she read it to you i exclaimed i thought that she did now i don t know i can t be sure of anything she read to me what she said was a copy of the letter that is the worked out code she may have left out entire paragraphs she may have changed it in any way in order to keep her terrible secret from me yes but what did she tell you the letter contained danny looked at her wrist watch it is too long even to begin to tell now and i don t want to tell it again not to day i have told john all about it you see later of course or you may ask john to tell you it it was an insult from beginning to end an insult to her i can t bear thinking of it any more not to day mary her voice changed suddenly as did her manner do you know why uncle sam asked me almost commanded me to be in the living room at three o clock to day no danny i don t but he told mrs ricker and me to be there too i guess he just wants to talk to all of us together oh talk what good is talk going to do talk in a place like this now where there is not one true certain thing to get hold of anywhere where not one of us can believe in another she put a quick hand to her lips her eyes widened she turned and hastily pushing aside the heavy curtain went through the clothes closet into her own room i sat still at the desk the paper before me and the sharp pencil in my hand tempted me to make a list as they always do in books of the clues to date i wrote locked door key in my pocket t a i put only the initials of tobacco ashes chad s suicide chad s note what person was he trying to shield what did hubert hand think that i had overheard in the cabin mrs ricker s threat q cap for typewriter key contents of the beaded bag two cigs missing from full case empty match box empty purse missing bill fold robbery crumpled handkerchief tears pleading broken cig holder hubert hand s note the code letter gabrielle s note to danny this i submit as the world s worst list of clues it is the best example i have ever seen of the saying that a person could not see the forest for the trees the forest was there right enough all i would have needed to do was to back off far enough away from the trees to look at it my face burns even yet when i realize that at half past two o clock on the afternoon of the fifth of july if i had been possessed of just one lick of sense i could instead of writing that list of clues have written another one a list that step by step just as sure as straight ahead would have led to the guilty person why did i not take into consideration the fact that for two months the canneziano girls had been searching for something on the desert moon something which i was all but certain they had not found why did i not give a thought to the fact that john after a secret conversation with gaby according to mrs ricker had been clean and clear away off the place since early afternoon until evening why did i not include in my list the fact that gaby had given the gold monkey to martha why instead of trying to puzzle out the code letter did i not read between the lines of gabrielle s last note to danny however at the time since it was of my own making i was quite well satisfied with my list i took it to the table to check over the items sam had put the key with which i had opened the attic door alongside the other things there i picked it up now and looked at it for the first time i had not looked at it i had merely used it the night before my heart jumped up in my throat it was not the key to the attic door it was a rusty old pass key that had hung on a nail in the broom closet off the kitchen for more years than i could remember whoever had put this key in my pocket must have been well acquainted with the desert moon kitchen to have found that old key under the brooms and mops and dust rags and chamois skins and the rest that hung around it and over it in the broom closet what had become of the key to the attic door chapter xxvi the session when i went down to the living room at five minutes before three danny john mrs ricker and martha were all there danny and john were sitting at the far end of the room mrs ricker was in a chair near the window tatting martha was on the biggest davenport playing with the monkey charm i went and sat beside her i feel sleepy she answered my question but i am happy now i am very happy that s nice i told her but if i were you i wouldn t talk much about being happy that is not to day i don t care gaby was hateful and mean even if she did give me the monkey she was good then but she wasn t good long enough for me to like her i m sorry because chad died though i was awfully sorry until i happened to remember about heaven he is happy there now when i die i ll go to heaven and be happy too he ll love me then won t he i know he will of course martha i said and he loved you here too only like a little girl i wanted him to love me like a lady he would have i guess if he hadn t shot himself i am sorry he did that but i m happy anyway cause we are going to have the fireworks to night tut tut i said we won t be having any fireworks to night her lower lip curled out daddy promised she whimpered yesterday when it looked like rain he said never to mind that we d have them the very first night it didn t rain to night is the first night daddy promised to my shame i never in all the years had gotten used to martha she looked like a big healthy strapping girl and when as now i realized that a smart five year old child would have had a better mind it shocked me all over sam and hubert hand came into the room together sam looked around counting noses all here he said and locked the door he and hubert had come through and dropped the key in his pocket he went all around the room closing and locking the doors and windows he moved a chair to the foot of the stairway pulled a small table over beside it took his six gun out of his back pocket put it on the table and sat down in the chair no one had moved nor had said a word i know that i was frightened i was not afraid of sam and i was not afraid of that six gun it did not make me a mite more uneasy than a bouquet of flowers would have that is if sam had carried the bouquet in and put it on the table with the same manner with which he had carried and placed the gun mostly i guess i was afraid of being made afraid partly i was afraid of myself hubert hand spoke first cannon ugh he sneered that s all right hand sam answered this is here mostly i think for ornamental purposes daddy martha piped up aren t we going to have the fireworks to night sam frowned at her not to night daughter she opened her mouth and began making those dreadful noises she always made whenever she was crossed in anything sam rapped on the table shut that up here and now he said not another whimper out of you hear me martha she closed her mouth with a snap i thought those immense eyes of hers would pop out of her head i am sure that the others of us all felt the way she looked in all the years we had lived together on the desert moon it was the first time any one of us had ever heard sam speak impatiently to martha as for scolding her being stern with her up to this minute it had never been in the book john sam said you and danny come out of that corner up here nearer the rest of us and where it is light i tell you they came straight and sat on the small davenport beside hubert hand i reckon sam began that all of you in here know that anyone could walk up to any man or woman in here and call him or her a murderer and that not one of us could give him the lie right now i reckon that you know too as everyone in the country knows that at this hour the desert moon ranch is rotten with the muck of crime and suspicion maybe you don t know that it is not going to stay that way for many more hours we have called the law in as was right and proper and the law has been real polite and blinked its eyes and departed folded its tents like the arabs and silently stole away well that s all right i didn t much care about having those fellows mix into my private business anyway not until i had found out that i couldn t attend to it myself i am not going to find that out i can attend to it i am going to right here and now later on when we need the law again we ll call on it the innocent in this room will have their names cleared the desert moon will be a fit place for a white man to live on now this gun here may look like i felt violent or something i don t and i m not going to act violent this gun is here for just one purpose and i m dead certain it won t be used for that a word to the wise though no person barring none and including the ladies is to leave this room until i give the word no innocent person in here will try to leave any guilty person in here and before god there is a guilty person here guilty at least of aiding and abetting is going to have too much sense to try to make a break that is why i won t need the gun not i mean until we find the guilty person when we have found him it may be of some use until the sheriff can get here that is all of that except that we are going to stay here one and all right here in this room until we are ready to phone for the sheriff if everyone does as i am going to tell them to do we should be through with this session by supper time but if we don t get through until midnight or until next week we ll stay here until we do all i m asking of everybody here is that you all tell the truth you ll have to sooner or later better make it sooner during this speech my dander had been rising it had got up pretty good and high by this time sam stanley i spoke out you ought to know that you can t force truth out of anybody at the point of a gun nor by keeping them locked up we ll get hungry we ll get thirsty and when we do we ll eat and drink and go about our affairs at least i will unless you shoot me i m not fixed to put up with this kind of foolishness mary sam roared at me that s enough out of you you be quiet you are going to do as you are told so are the others sam had never spoken like that to me before it left me limp as a drained jelly bag before i could get my breath for an answer hubert hand was talking changed your mind since morning haven t you sam you were dead sure this morning that no one on the place had had anything to do with the murder that mary had locked the attic door herself earlier in the day and absent mindedly dropped the key in her pocket never mind about my morning s opinions hand you are right dead right i ve changed my mind now since you are already going pretty good i ll begin with you and work around the room taking each one in turn i want you to tell everything you know and everything you suspect concerning the murder sorry hubert hand said but i don t know a damn thing except that apparently she was strangled to death sometime between four o clock yesterday afternoon and eight o clock yesterday evening we saw her alive at four we found her dead at eight that s the extent of my knowledge all right now go ahead with what you suspect i can t see hubert hand objected that suspicions have any place here beyond stirring up a rumpus and hard feelings they wouldn t get any of us any place that is for me to decide sam said you were mighty busy for a while this morning throwing out hints and slurs if this session doesn t do anything else it can anyway clear out all this whispering that is going around just now everybody here is busy suspecting everybody else here suspicions usually have some reasoning behind them where there s smoke there s fire it is only fair to give everyone here a chance to examine everyone else s suspicions and disprove them if they can if you think that i did the killing i want to know it i want a chance to prove you wrong come on now hand come clean suppose i refuse that is up to you sam drawled as the sheriffs say everything you say will be used against you but as they don t say everything you don t say will be used against you a sight harder if i knew you had no suspicions i wouldn t try to force you to invent some just to be sociable but you were pretty free with your hints this morning all right talk hubert lowered his roman nose and pulled at his moustache for a minute it was easy to see he was busy with a decision of some sort he settled back in his chair more comfortably and still pulling at his moustache he began chapter xxvii hubert hand talks well he said i can talk all right but i want to start with this understanding i don t know any facts that amount to a damn you re right that i have suspicions if you weren t forcing them out of me i d have sense enough to keep my mouth shut from now on at least until airing them might do some good but since you are determined to have them now at the point of a gun i ll say that i think john did it and that somebody else in the house is shielding him danny gave a thin sick little shriek and threw her arm around john in a protecting way john straightened under his tan i could see the color seeping out of his face gently he removed danny s arm sam lowered his white eyebrows until his eyes looked like two slits of blue light glinting out from away behind his face when he spoke his voice was iron why do you think john killed her in the first place john is the only one here who hasn t a water tight alibi not by a damn sight he isn t sam interrupted but never mind go on at four o clock gaby came down through the room while she was still in sight danny called down trying to get her to come back now this is just another suspicion i don t know whether anyone here will back me up in it or not probably not he added the last in a hateful slurring way but i noticed that her voice sounded strange like she was excited maybe or else afraid sam asked did anyone else here notice anything of that kind i had decided right at first to keep my mouth shut about everything so i did i thought not hubert hand said as if he had known from the start that he was the only honest one in the crowd mrs ricker spoke i noticed it she said hubert bowed at her in a sort of mocking way knowing what i knew i thought that her corroboration would do hubert hand more harm than good but of course the others did not know what i knew nor were they going to know it since hubert hand was keeping his part of our bargain right or wrong i was thankful just then that we had made that bargain let me see hubert hand continued where was i gaby after going through the room stopped on the porch for a minute to talk to chad he came into the house in a fine humor gaby then went around the house to the rabbit hutch and for some reason gave her bracelet to martha when martha s turn comes in this inquisition i suggest that she be questioned rather closely sam banged his fist on the table never mind your suggestions you are accusing john now stick to that you bet hubert hand accepted especially since martha was in the house again within five or ten minutes with every last one of us danny had come down by that time from four to five then you and i were playing chess chad was at the piano danny and mary were over there talking together mrs ricker was tatting where she is now by the window martha was bothering us part of the time and part of the time she was just fooling around the room i m pretty certain not one of us left this room during that hour you might check up on that sam sam asked mrs ricker and danny and me if we remembered anyone s leaving the room during that hour we all said we did not danny added that she might not have noticed i wished seeing hubert hand smile she had let well enough alone and not bothered to add that at five hubert hand resumed we three men went together to let the cows in and to milk mary i believe was in the kitchen alone getting supper during that time mrs ricker danny and martha remained here in the living room is that right maybe it is and maybe it isn t sam said there is the hour in there before supper that we ll all have to account for right accurately before any of us has that water tight alibi you were talking about hand and sam added with his own sort of emphasis we won t have it then all right hubert hand agreed you and chad and i went down to the barns together we let the cows in we milked them at least you and i did chad stayed with you and was kidding around down in your end of the barn i heard you laughing and talking down there together the whole time is that right practically sam answered all but i couldn t swear that you were in the barn during the entire time no well i ll admit that i hadn t thought of that if i d thought of it i d probably have known that you how is it couldn t swear that i was in the barn during the entire time meaning sam demanded that if john is guilty you ll shield him with your last lie sam s fist knotted at his side his voice was not iron now it was tempered steel we ll settle about my last lie later hand you re begging for this hubert hand reminded him get on i milked four cows not very good for the time about forty minutes but as good work as you did and i will swear that you were in the barn the entire time anyway that is easy settled mary did i or did anyone of the three of us come through the kitchen and go upstairs during that hour no i answered weren t you sam questioned going back and forth between the kitchen and the dining room no danny set the table for me i didn t step foot out of the kitchen mrs ricker hubert hand questioned did any one of us men come in and go upstairs through the living room during that hour no she said mrs ricker sam asked were you right there alone in the living room during that entire hour i was not alone martha was with me and several times during the hour five or six times at least danny came in from the dining room to see whether she could see john coming up the road danny sam spoke to her were mrs ricker and martha in the living room every time you went in there i think so only think so eh hubert hand half sneered it i mean danny explained that i am sure mrs ricker was here she was sitting right by the window i did not particularly notice martha i can vouch for martha mrs ricker snapped all right hubert hand went on so far so good the ladies i think especially if you remember the glass doors between the living room and the dining room have established alibis that would satisfy any jury now for you and chad and me again we walked together carrying the milk to the dairy there we took off the barn coveralls and at your suggestion washed up in the dairy kitchen to save time we came back to the house together mary said that supper was on the table we all sat down to the table together all present you see except john would it have been possible for you or for me or for chad to have gone down to the barn you and i each milked four cows remember come back to the house and through it with not one of these ladies seeing us committed the murder got back to the barn and then to the house again all in an hour i think sam the wisest thing you can do is to grant us all our alibis for that hour anyway and then work on from there if you re bound to i felt reasonably certain that if hubert hand had gone through the living room between five and six o clock mrs ricker would not tell of it but i was more certain that danny on the watch out for john would have seen anyone who had come in through the front door the alibi hour sounds fine hand sam said but you are making a mistake you are assuming that i think that someone here committed the murder i don t think that i do think that someone in this room right now knows who did it where any one of us was or was not at the particular hour you re making such a stew about probably doesn t cut any ice i think it does i began this you know by saying that i thought john you said that once sam interrupted once is plenty go ahead with it now if you can give your proofs there you go i told you i didn t have any proofs didn t i when you made me talk but i have got some pretty solid bases for my suspicions john decided all of a sudden to go to rattail for the mail or something the kidding he came in for right then shows whether he usually went for the mail on a holiday afternoon he was gone four hours instead of the two two and a half anyway that he could have made it in he had two bum excuses first tire trouble that would be a better excuse if the car wasn t standing in the garage right now with the same tires on it that he started out with i know you said you had no proof of anything sam broke in i reckon of course you can prove that though john spoke i don t think he could prove it dad since the spare was a truetread same as the others but he s right i changed tires twice that s all the spare was rotten when i had the second blow out i patched the first tire and put it back on the patch is there to prove that and the rotten spare hubert hand questioned it wasn t worth bothering to put on the rack i rolled it off across the desert my mistake hubert hand said maybe two hours is a long time to change tires even twice the second excuse was that he had met leo saule and had given him a tow saule is a rotten little half breed who could be bought for a half dollar also he lives alone away off the main road john jumped to his feet get this hand sam had jumped too he got to john and put his hands on his shoulders keep your shirt on son i am to blame for this your turn is coming wait for it go on hand john hesitated and sat down again sam went back to his chair by the table sorry hubert hand apologized i don t like this a damn bit better than john does but it seems to be up to me well then he came in two hours late he came through the kitchen and instead of leaving the car in the garage he left it in the back entrance he went straight upstairs it took him half an hour or more to get shaved and change his clothes when he came down he acted like a man in a daze he couldn t eat he offered being out in the sun as an excuse he is out in the sun every day i think that he had met gaby as they had planned right after dinner when he started for rattail maybe she had promised him to leave the place he was crazy to get her off the ranch i know that he told me so just the other day said she was making trouble here and so on she may have had something on him that she was threatening to tell danny or sam i don t know about that either i don t know a damn thing about whatever they might have had between them but i think that he killed her out on the desert some place i don t think that he had planned to do it i think he must have threatened her off and on though her note to danny and other things show that she was afraid for her life all the same i think he started it yesterday as a bluff but the desire was back of the bluff that s pretty certain i don t know why he brought her body back and hid it in the house i don t give him credit for figuring out what a smart thing that was to do he may have been afraid of footprints in the road or on the desert if he carried the body away and tried to hide it out there he didn t know that the storm was coming to cover up his traces i think though that it was pure funk that made him come driving home with the body hidden in the car covered with the sacks of rock salt i didn t like to think that it was danny who helped him out after that it didn t seem like her i couldn t think of anyone else though who would help him in the last few minutes i ve managed to think of someone else it is a lucky thing for john you are a damn sight stronger ally sam than danny or any one else would have been for instance this present magnificent bluff of yours all right sam said all through i m satisfied if you are hubert hand answered i m not sam drawled because like the caterpillar said it s all wrong from beginning to end it is a queer thing though the way quotations always come to me most of the time you were talking hand i kept thinking of this one give a guilty man enough rope and he will hang himself chapter xxviii john talks if you mean me dad john spoke right up and i d given a pretty penny to have had him say something else for of course sam had not meant him i m not worried they don t hang innocent men in nevada no matter how much rope their friends present them with as a matter of fact hubert hand said i guess they don t hang any men in nevada now do they lethal chamber isn t it sam growled at him to shut up and told john that it was his turn to talk and to go ahead and to try to talk sense if possible i don t know where to begin john said i ve got nothing to talk about begin at the beginning what did gaby say to you after dinner that made you decide right off to go to rattail i ve told you that already i ve got no changes to make in it gaby told me after dinner that danny s headache was getting worse she said that danny had sent to salt lake for a certain kind of headache medicine the only kind that ever did her any good she said it should have come in the morning s mail she said that danny would be peeved at her for telling me about it asking me to go that is so if i didn t want a fuss and wanted to be allowed to go i d better make a sneak of it with no explanations i did here is something i haven t told though for danny just told me when we came in here at three she hadn t sent for any headache medicine to salt lake nor anywhere that certainly looks as if gaby wanted to get either me or the sedan off the job and out of the way yesterday afternoon she must have had some reason for sending me on a fool s errand like that well well go on son sam said after we had all sat in dead silence for about a minute go on where john asked i ve got nothing more to say hand s told the rest of it hasn t he answer him you fool sam roared you ve got answers haven t you use em sitting there like a dummy did anyone see you towing saule to his place not that i know of i towed him all right but i can t prove it hand was right when he said he could be bought for a half dollar he might come cheaper i d try him with a quarter first hand good god sam shouted what are you trying to do pry your way into the lethal chamber can you give a reason for driving to the back door instead of leaving the car in the garage only two hundred pound sacks of rock salt they d dumped them on the platform for us this morning from eighteen i could give a reason for bringing them up instead of leaving them there until we went down with the truck sure i m full of reasons got a good reason for taking half an hour to bathe and dress it would be hard to find a guy with more reasons than i can produce for everything all but murdering the twin sister of the girl i love son sam said i don t blame you a damn bit for being sore clear to the bone but come to that we haven t any right to blame hand here either not if he is honest in his suspicions and maybe he is i forced them out of him can t you swallow your pride for a while and i ve swallowed it already john said if that s what you want swallowed it till i m choked with it i know i know but it is like this john and this goes for all you folks too a person can t get to the bottom of anything without going down in this case it looks like we were going to have to go pretty low down a trip to hell for most of us i reckon but it will be a round trip most of us will come up clean to a clean desert moon can t we go down then like a lot of reasonable human beings and not like a kennel of yapping dogs it won t hold dad john answered not this round trip to hell stuff as human beings if i hadn t stopped being a human being that is a man i wouldn t have sat still here and let hand have his say out and i wouldn t have done it not to save my own neck but i know how you feel about the ranch i ve gone through with it for that reason and for danny though i know that all of this is a rotten mistake on your part i know that but it is no use telling you now that you ve started i ll go on with it the best i can i guess the others will too but none of us will come up clean as you say don t look for that not after this muck all right hop to it dad what s your next question i was relieved when sam asked do you suspect with reason anyone in this room i had thought following right along with hubert hand s accusations as sam had been doing that his next question would be about what was troubling and bothering john when he came in why he had acted so queerly that he had had to explain it by saying he was loco from the sun i do not john answered sam s question straight but it seems darn queer to me the way everyone is leaving chad s suicide out of this hold on dad i m not saying that i think chad killed her i know he didn t but i know just as well that he didn t walk out and shoot himself simply because he had loved gaby chad was a queer bird all right i guess none of us understood him very well he was as emotional as the deuce too i ll grant that but he was not ever a damn fool john danny interrupted do you think that a man who kills himself when he finds that the girl he loves has been cruelly murdered needs to be a fool yes john answered a man might not care much about living after that but if he killed himself he d be a fool i mean it is like this regular fellows and chad sure was one don t walk out and kill themselves when they find the girl they love is dead it takes more than death to make a real man kill himself sounds like a book i know but loss of honor is a reason and shame maybe that s the same thing is another reason or a fellow might kill himself to save the honor of his girl or to save a friend s life if he owed the friend a lot danny interrupted again absolute despair should be a reason sure i know how you mean but chad had despaired of gaby s love long ago dozens of times i ve seen her treat him so rottenly that if he had been the suicidal sort he would have killed himself right then no sir i tell you chad did not shoot himself because gaby was dead sure that was a part of it but not the main part chad was a darn good guy good all the way through we all know that he didn t kill her we d know it if dad didn t have his alibis for him but what i m getting at is that someway or other and not meaning to at all he got himself mixed up in it when he saw what had happened and realized that he had been involved there s your reason all right i think that if we can find out why chad shot himself we ll find out most of the other things we want to know i m through dad i ve said all i ve got to say and more too sam hesitated a minute i was relieved to see him take chad s note out of his pocket chad says that he killed her he said and read the note aloud everyone but me to whom it was no surprise and martha who was almost asleep again squeaked or gasped or otherwise showed their horrified astonishment john spoke first i ll bet four dollars he never wrote it sam passed the paper to him it looks like his writing it sounds like him too soon as i can get track of one of these what you may call em s handwriting experts i m going to send it to him i reckon it will match up all right i wish there was an expert of some kind that we could send it to to find out why he wrote it uncle sam danny said and i could see that the note had upset her pretty badly there is something no one has thought of we haven t had time to think but where was chad during the hour we were hunting for gaby you and john and mary and i were in the sedan but where were the others during that time between seven and eight o clock wasn t it i reckon sam spoke real gently to her that we have all had time to do some tall thinking about that hour little girl but there couldn t be any doubt that gaby had been dead a sight longer than an hour when we found her but can you know that for a certainty danny insisted just as certain as i know that she was dead danny i well in the early days here never mind that though i ve had experience with deaths kind of on that order i know the coroner and the sheriff knew but she might have been brought into the house during that hour hand let loose on his alibi business a little too early i m no fool hubert hand interrupted you admit that she could not have been murdered during the hour between six and seven every one of us except john can account for every minute of our time from four o clock when we saw gaby alive up to seven all right all right sam said have it your own way but you ve had your say and plenty of time to say it in you ll maybe have another turn later now keep still we are going to hear from the others it is your turn next danny i m sorry you understand we haven t any time to lose take it easy though do you suspect with reason anyone in this room of being connected with the murder chapter xxix danny i think danny said that chad did it sam lowered his brows and turned those blue searchlights of his on her that is a bad beginning my girl he said kindly enough though you don t think that not for a minute better start over again uncle sam she pleaded listen you spoke about clearing everyone s name and about the honor of the desert moon chad s confession does that does all of it why not let well enough alone my own words but i had not expected to hear them from danny the only reason for them seemed to be that hubert hand had frightened her with his case against john was she the sort of girl who would keep on loving john and marry him if she thought that he had killed her sister i did not believe it john said danny and knowing as little as i do about being loved i knew that i should hate to have my sweetheart pronounce my name with a pinch of horror and a pinch of anger and a big dash of bewilderment as john had pronounced hers sam said somebody else suggested that to day danny i told them that there was no question of well enough while the man who had murdered your sister was going about alive and while his helper was keeping his secret on the desert moon you said that danny questioned and gave us all another severe shock by accenting the pronoun i said that yes sam showed signs of rising dander and i thought that you if anyone more than anyone would agree with me only she answered i should rather let a guilty person go free escape than to persecute an innocent person no innocent person is going to be persecuted on the desert moon sam said and no guilty one is going to escape either you re going to be a good sensible girl too and answer a few questions i want to ask you first thing i want to know is what was it that you girls were hunting for all the time here on the ranch we had been told danny answered that there was a very large sum of money hidden here on this place we came to get it that is gaby did i mean before we left the continent i knew that i wanted to stay here for a long time i cared much more about staying here and keeping gaby here than i cared about finding the money really i i hoped not to find the money the people with whom i had been living in england had broken up their home there i had no home that is how i happened to be in switzerland with gaby i she broke down and hid her face in her hands we all sat quietly and waited with her face still covered she appealed to sam uncle i can t tell all this to day i can t i loved gaby i did love her if she were alive but she isn t please please don t force me to go on with this you ve got me wrong danny sam said i didn t expect you to tell about all of your past lives and that but this stuff now about money hidden here could it have any bearing on the murder she shook her head i think not not possibly there was no money here anyway as it turned out that is if gaby told me the truth about anything i thought that she did but now she spoke of keeping fear and dread from me in her last note to me i i can t talk of this to day i tell you see here dad john spoke up danny isn t fit to go through with this to day i think she has told me everything she has to tell she told me most of it this morning i ve got it straight how about allowing me to go on with it do you think any of it might have a bearing on the murder yes i think it might sam banged on the table with his fist by god he roared what kind of people have i got to deal with not five minutes ago you sat right there and swore that you had told everything you know couldn t even begin couldn t think of a thing to say no suspicion no hints of any kind except a slur at a dead boy now you come out with this by the lord hand you may be a better man than i think you are danny s voice cut in like scissors slithering through taffeta silk be careful there she said i remembered the way she had brushed the beaded bag something cold went trailing down my backbone it was time and past i thought for me to take a hand sam i said what s become of all your fine talk about us not acting like yelping dogs and swallowing our pride and helping out and so on i told you when you started this that it was a fool piece of business you nor nobody can force truth out of folks you re kind of back on your quotations or you d remember the one about leading a horse to water how do you think anyone is ever going to get any place with you pounding and shouting and blaspheming around all the while if you think the fact that john wouldn t betray danny s confidence to satisfy a crazy whim of yours makes him out a murderer you ve got less sense at sixty five than you had when you were born the best thing you can do is to follow your advice to me and be quiet john s ready to talk now if you ll keep still and give him half a chance i have never yet seen the man who wouldn t quiet down mild as mush when a sensible woman took it on herself to give him a good scolding the strongest man will drop before a good strong volley of woman s words the same as he would before a shooting squad go on john i said seeing that sam had dropped and wanting john to get a start before sam had had time to pick himself up and dust off and ask danny what she had meant by hissing at him to be careful shall i danny john asked she nodded it isn t any too pleasant even for me john began but the straight of it is that while danny for years was a companion to this lady in england gaby was running around over europe with a darned rotten lot of associates on the face of things she was an actress leading lady with a company that traveled all over the country over several countries giving plays that seemed to be mostly a blind though for her real occupation which was leading lady with a crew of blackmailers danny doesn t admit it but i think there is no doubt but that she had a lover named lewis bauermont something like that he was leading man in the theatrical company manager of it and also of the blackmailing gang about six months before danny wrote here the lady whom danny had been serving as a companion died it left danny at loose ends she had stayed there more for love than for money she had next to no money saved gaby wrote that she could give her a small part in her company danny joined her in france she had been there a couple of weeks when the company went on the rocks danny thought it was done purposely since one of their blackmail victims was making it too hot for them gabrielle and danny went to switzerland this lewis what s his name bauermont bauermont showed up there in a few days and hung around he and gaby got to quarreling all the time gaby who had always had plenty of money began to be short of funds danny was as miserable as well as danny would be in a mess like that she remembered this place and begged gaby to come here and rest a while and get rid of this bauermont and the other hangers on and get ready to make a fresh start you know a clean start dan says gaby had real ability as an actress and that she could have easily found a position in some stock company in the united states gaby wouldn t listen to danny s plan of coming here but once or twice she used the idea as a threat to make this bauermont bird come to terms he wouldn t come later gaby began to give him some of his own blackmailing medicine i guess he was pretty keen to get rid of her and her having talked about the desert moon gave him his idea he showed up one night with a letter from canneziano written from san quentin bauermont was old enough by the way to have been gaby s father he and canneziano had been pals here in the united states and had gotten together again three years ago when bauermont had been over here for six months the letter which had been forwarded all over this country and half of europe said only that he was to leave prison on the fourth of july and wanted to know where he could meet bauermont shortly after that date probably all canneziano wanted was to renew his old connections but the letter was cryptic enough for bauermont to make his story out of it a cock and bull yarn about how he and canneziano had held up that tonopah mail train three years ago the train that was carrying a big shipment of currency for the federal reserve bank a hundred thousand dollars wasn t it we all remember it i guess the robbers got away well this bauermont bird told the girls that he and canneziano had been the robbers it seems he made a pretty fair story out of it how he and canneziano had decided that every bank in the country would have the numbers of the bills by morning and how they d agreed to cache them in some safe place for a rather long time they d thought it best too to part company so bauermont went on to salt lake and canneziano since we were handy came and hid the money here on the ranch sam interrupted like hell he did no of course he didn t dad i m giving you bauermont s story that s all according to him canneziano hid the money here he was to have joined bauermont in salt lake but he got scared and went south instead to frisco he d been there only a few weeks when he got pinched for running a gambling hall and sent up for three years bauermont went to see him after he was in prison he told bauermont that he had hidden the money here all right but he would not tell him where he said it was safe that no one could find it not in a thousand years that was all bauermont could get out of him except a promise to meet him when he got out of prison and come here with him to get the money you anyone can see that the whole story is as full of holes as a sieve i don t understand how gaby ever fell for it danny will believe most anything anyone tells her she is so honest herself she thinks everyone else is honest you can imagine how this plan of coming here to get the money went against the grain with her but she was so desperate about gaby and the rottenness there that she was willing to accept any plan to get gaby away from it i thought we could not find the money danny supplemented though john says i believe anything someway i never did fully believe that story i never believed anything really that lewis said it was the only chance i had to get gaby away from there and i took it on the principle you know of solving one problem at a time well john said that s that the letter gaby got a few days ago was from this bauermont danny could not read the code but she has every reason to think that the copy gaby read to her was genuine in it he said that the whole thing from start to finish had been a put up job on gaby he and canneziano had been in denver at the time had read all the accounts of the train robbery in the papers and had kicked themselves to think that they hadn t been smart enough to have pulled it off themselves but they had not had had no connection with the affair the point of it was that he had found another girl was tired of gaby and wanted to ship her out of the way danny says the whole thing was an insult from beginning to end and that it seemed to have been written with no other motive than a desire to humiliate gaby twit her laugh in her face sounds fishy to me sam mused if this fellow wanted to be shed of her seems as if the best thing he could have done was to keep his mouth shut and keep her here hunting the hidden treasure until the end of time i think danny answered that he thought gaby might grow tired of searching and return to him lewis knew that father was to be released and that he and gaby might meet at any time and gaby would then learn the truth lewis is mean and cruel he wanted the zest if you can possibly understand of writing that cruel wicked letter see here sam said suppose after writing it he got scared of what he had done gaby you know was well she was a pretty violent girl he might have thought it over and decided that it would be a lot safer to have her clear out of the way or more likely before he ever wrote that letter he might have made arrangements with some one of his gang over here to come up and put her out of the way shortly after she d got the letter i move hubert hand interrupted that we all adjourn and go to hunt for the secret staircase and the concealed passage way trying to be funny sam asked with a bright blue glare not at all but the secret staircase is all that is lacking isn t it we ve begun with the buried treasure we ve got the motive and the international band of organized criminals slick all there romantic and thrilling as you please only it is a long way from switzerland to nevada and the key in mary s pocket chapter xxx an accusation damn the key in mary s pocket sam exploded i m beginning to think i was right at first when i said that mary locked the door absent mindedly and dropped the key in her pocket herself i judged that i could wait until my turn came to mention that the key in my pocket was the old pass key and not the key to the attic door in the next minute i wished that i had not waited but had told it so that sam might have busied his mind with that well john he said does that finish up the part of the story danny couldn t tell i think so dad all right now danny what did you mean a few minutes ago when you warned me to be careful like you did i danny stammered wanted you to be careful about what you said in anger in other words you wanted me to be careful about saying anything that would seem to implicate john she did not answer if john was guilty sam insisted would you want him to go scot free john is not guilty how do you know that i know it in the same way that you all seem to know that chad was not guilty i know john that s all right but you can t know john s innocence like we know chad s because from the time gaby came downstairs until we all set out to look for her chad was not out of my sight he was at the piano he walked to the barn with me he stayed in the barn with me he walked back to the house with me he was with us all during supper you said danny say that chad was in the barn with you during all of that hour i wonder whether chad if he were alive could swear that you were in the barn with him during all of that hour what do you mean by that my girl sam questioned danny sat and stared at him her eyes wide her lips bitten tight sat and looked as if she were frightened plumb out of her senses and did not say one word you meant something when you said that sam insisted now what was it come speak up it was no way for him to talk to her feeling as she felt and her sister not yet in her grave i was downright ashamed for him i guess the others felt as i did for hubert hand said never mind lay off that sam what do you expect to get from an hysterical girl you don t deserve it you let me down flat but just to prove that i m a white man i ll say that i know you were in the barn all the time of course if i wasn t there my testimony for you wouldn t amount to much but you know damn well i was there and i know damn well that you were so let up on the little lady mary s turn next isn t it hold on sam said since danny s gone this far she shouldn t grudge an extra word or two come now danny i don t aim to treat you mean and you know i m sorry for you and feel for you in your trouble but what is it you have on your mind she sat there still as a mouse her big eyes growing bigger from fright i guess there is some of the brute in every man i had never before suspected that sam stanley had his share you ll have to talk when this case comes to court he said it will come to court don t forget that just now it looks as if john were going to have to come up for trial your silence does him a sight more harm than good you should know that oh she exclaimed short and sharp as if it hurt her it isn t john i am trying to shield i am i am trying to save his happiness for him that s all his happiness and my own just now john said gently isn t the time to be thinking about our happiness danny if you have anything to say please say it you won t blame me she pleaded you won t blame me afterwards could i blame you for telling what you think is the truth hubert she spoke suddenly and very sharply for her did you see uncle sam all that time in the barn could you see him all the time while you were milking the cows he says he could not see you no hubert hesitated no i guess i didn t see him all the time he was at one end of the barn and i was at the other but i heard him talking to chad all the time they were kidding back and forth sam baiting chad along you know how they do did sam was right there all the time danny no getting away from that but there is she said you all seem to have forgotten it but chad was a mimic and a ventriloquist he could have stayed there in the barn alone and with no trouble at all made you think that uncle sam was there too and that they were talking together i stopped breathing i think the others stopped breathing their breaths would have sounded noisy in that silence john spoke first four cows got milked chad couldn t milk he never milked a cow in his life how do you know danny said and i was surprised that she should oppose john like that you know only that chad said he could not milk we all know that he was lazy he was raised on a farm how do you know that john echoed her own words i don t know it he told me that he was john said he told me that he was born and reared in chicago shut up john sam commanded go on danny that s all she said except that if chad could milk that would have given uncle sam nearly all of that hour dan john s voice sounded as if he were talking to one of his meanest broncos stop it sitting here and accusing dad with no evidence nothing but a crazy wild idea that is not true i have evidence i picked up gaby s bag from the steps yesterday evening tobacco and pipe ashes were sticking to it only a few i think someone had tried to brush them off hurriedly as a man might and had made a poor job of it no one else on this place smokes a pipe no one else anywhere drops his pipe whenever he is excited she turned to me that is what i told you i dared not tell she hid her face in her hands sam s pipe fell from his mouth chapter xxxi the session ends it seemed to me that when sam s pipe hit the floor it made a noise like doom cracking we all sat still as stones i suppose it could not have been more than a minute but it seemed a long time before john left danny s side and went and picked up the pipe and handed it to sam it s all right dad he said not by a damn sight it s not all right sam came back to his senses vigorously but it is interesting this thing it is getting interesting anyway let me see if i had got chad to help me and i could have by telling him it was some joke or other i had on hand i could have sneaked out of the barn met her and killed her during that hour when could i have got the body upstairs though that s the first missing link my reason for killing her would be another but say see here dad john cut in you shut up son we are waiting to hear the rest of what danny has to say come danny can you supply either of those missing links no she said and sighed it was easy to see that she was plumb tuckered out no of course i can t if sam went on seemingly talking entirely to himself if i d hurried like blazes i might have done the deed and carried her into the house during the time i was absent from the barn i d have had to pass mary in the kitchen i d have been bound to sneak in the back way but if i asked her not to more than likely mary wouldn t tell on me or i might have had a hireling that s what they call them isn t it there s another word something like marmot no never mind on the outside who would have toted the body in for me while we were at supper written out that sounds as if sam had been trying to be comical he was not at all he was sitting there speaking his thoughts for all to hear making out a case against himself cool as christmas for my part i had heard enough of it sam you look here i began you shut up too mary sam said mrs ricker spoke she had her say out nobody not even sam would any more think of telling mrs ricker to shut up than they would think of telling any other dumb object that suddenly started to talk to shut up leading a life of silence i thought certainly did have its advantages at times i think mrs ricker said that the girl herself probably killed her sister if sam s pipe ashes were on the bag she put them there afterwards to make trouble for him sam said shucks i thought john would be the first to speak i was mistaken it was danny herself who said make her talk now uncle sam don t wait for her turn i can t bear it make her talk now and give her reasons for saying such a cruel wicked lying thing mrs ricker sam put the question very solemnly have you any reasons for making this accusation my only reason is that i believe it don t beat around the bush why do you believe it i have a feeling that she is guilty this sam said sternly is no time for feeling nor for quibbling you made a serious accusation straight out i want your reason or reasons for making it and i want them just as straight i have no reasons mrs ricker said that is why i suspect her ah ah ah women sam said and the way he said it it was the blackest oath he had used that day i looked at danny i had not been feeling any too kindly toward her for the past few minutes but just the same seeing her there white and pitiful with her hands caught up to her throat and with the echo of sam s last blasphemy still in my ears i had a woman feeling toward her i knew then as i know now that danielle canneziano could no more have killed gaby than she could have created her i think i said talking fast to keep sam from shutting me up before i could get anything said that if in suspicioning an innocent girl like danny mrs ricker is simply drawing on her woman s instinct she d better pass it up for the present and listen to some plain sexless sense gaby came downstairs at four danny called after her right then so danny was in the house right then gaby went to the rabbit hutch and stopped long enough to give martha the bracelet almost as soon as martha was in the house with the bracelet danny was downstairs with us cool collected and undisturbed now suppose as an idiot suggested this morning that gaby had come straight back into the house i guess everyone would agree that it would take her five minutes to get back upstairs that would leave danny not more than ten minutes to kill her and to come downstairs as i ve said collected and undisturbed come to think of it gaby could not have talked to martha and got to the attic stairway in any five minutes at the widest figuring that leaves danny about five minutes as i had been fearing he would sam stopped me that s all right too mary but there is no need to draw so long a bow no need to count minutes on danny the note in gaby s bag fixes her innocence better than all the minutes on the clock could no it does not mrs ricker said gaby knew that she had reason to fear an enemy she probably found that out from the code letter she may never have suspected that the enemy was her own sister i wish i knew sam said giving mrs ricker a long look what you are getting at mrs ricker i d give that sam dangled out his right hand to know what any one of you was getting at you for instance know that danny did not kill her sister i think that hand knows that john didn t do it maybe not i m beginning to suspect him of honesty in this but a damn mistaken honesty at that i think that john knows that chad is as innocent as as a new born babe as mary says i think danny would have to be pretty hard put to it before she d invent that story about my pipe ashes dad john said and high time he was saying something dan didn t invent any story i know that she was clear off about the pipe ashes and i think she shouldn t have made such a mistake since they couldn t have been there she couldn t have seen them but danny doesn t lie she thought she saw the ashes there or she would not have said so all right son sam conceded i d a heap rather think that than not but see here did anyone else think they saw my pipe ashes around there i looked into my own blue voile lap i imagined i could feel hubert hand s eyes boring into me my face burned i could feel the waves of red going up into my scalp and spreading out around my ears i prayed a quick private prayer to the lord but i have learned through the years that trying to instruct the lord through the pretense of prayer is a supreme impudence that he usually punishes pretty promptly my face burned hotter than ever i raised my eyes sam was staring straight at me mary he said you found the body did you see pipe ashes there then my only excuse is that it takes longer than a minute or two minutes to betray a person who has been your best friend for twenty five years i said no i am going to ask you to swear to that somebody get the bible nobody moved you haven t made any of the others swear to anything i said i haven t caught any of the others in what i was sure was a direct and deliberate lie i felt weaker than filtered water it is one thing to tell a lie offhand into the free air i haven t much use for a person who can t do that when absolutely necessary it is another thing to put your hand on the good book and swear to a lie i knew that i could not do it martha sam said run and get the bible for dad martha seemed to be sound asleep again i did not notice anything queer about her appearance mrs ricker must have noticed something queer she jumped to her feet and dashed across the room to where martha was lying a shriek went piercing through the house splintering the air into quivering bits of agony everyone has wakened from sleep cold with the sweating terror of some hideous nightmare but with only the vaguest impressions of its detail so it is with me and that nightmare hour i can not reconstruct it it remains yet in my mind as nothing but a horror of confusions we all ran about i know that there was telephoning that some of us made desperate attempts with restoratives i remember sam s crying with his face uncovered like a child i can hear him saying that he had given her the sleeping powder had forced it upon her i can hear plainest of all mrs ricker s voice with all the pent up passions of years breaking forth in torrents of heartbreak my baby my baby girl my darling mother s life mother s heart speak to mother my lamb my baby her voice again but cruel now as she shrieks at hubert hand stand there you beast stand there dry eyed and look at your dead daughter the child you deserted the child you ignored i remember the feeling of the fresh air as i walked beside sam who was carrying martha out of the house i think that it was john who explained to me that the doctor who had left telko was going to meet us on the road in order to save time we must have walked slowly but i can not rid myself of the impression of mrs ricker running beside us i remember her scream when futile unnecessary horror sam stumbled with his burden as he went to step into the sedan as the car went dashing away i remember looking out of its windows at the house the great structure with its wide expanses and its towers and it seemed to me that it looked like some monster crouching there in the green some grim horrible monster waiting for its victims three of us had been caught in its clutches were any of us to escape chapter xxxii a part of the past the doctor who was younger and more cruel than even a doctor has a right to be said that martha had died from a stoppage of the heart undoubtedly induced by the strong drug in the sleeping powder that had been administered in other words sam had killed her he loved her how deeply he had loved her none of us had ever had sense enough to realize we had her funeral and chad s two days later they were buried in the second grove of aspen trees two miles beyond the cabin all the people in the valley came at first i thought that they had come to honor the dead and sam but as i stood by the graves and watched the faces about me faces that held suspicion horror curiosity sly faces cruel faces eager faces i did not care to think why most of them had come sam noticed it too for though i had not said a word to him as we walked home from the graves he said to me don t blame them mary what else could we expect decency breeds decency and filth draws filth there were only four of us around the table that evening mrs ricker had gone straight to her room after the funeral danny with no protest from sam had left the day before to take gaby s body to san francisco it had seemed heartless to allow her to go alone but i could not be spared and there was no one else to go with her john might have gone but danny refused to allow him to saying unselfishly that sam needed john more than she needed him you people hubert hand spoke suddenly to john and sam and me as we sat there looking at a supper that nobody pretended to eat have been awfully decent about not asking questions since the other afternoon i m done with questions sam said through finished just the same hubert hand replied there are a lot of answers that are going to have to be given sooner or later you heard mrs ricker say that i was martha s father never mind that now hand sam interrupted i ve known since the first week you came to the ranch that there was or had been something between you two you d been her lover i suppose well men do that s all i never went around thinking you nor any man was a plaster saint i reckon you deserted her eh and treated her like hell generally and she found a refuge here and later probably heard that you were in trouble and sent you a letter and told you to come here put you wise about the chess racket helped you made a refuge for you women do i suppose she slipped poor martha in in place of the child she d got from the orphanage used the same papers well to keep on repeating myself mothers do you and she have both lived straight and acted decent for the years you ve been here if the two of you want to keep on living in this hell hole and keep on straight and acting decent you ll get the same treatment from me you ve always got if you are martha s parents that s more reason not less for my not wanting to break up our family here or make trouble for either one of you hubert hand pushed back his chair got up and walked to the window by god but you re a white man sam he said you re so damn white that you make every one around you look yellow as sulphur by contrast you ve got it doped out right about ollie ricker and me she was twelve years older than i was i always felt like that was kind of an excuse for me guess not though she was a good enough girl until i came along just out of prison and as rotten as two years in prison can make a kid that s pretty damn rotten i shouldn t have been sent up that time nothing but a kid s trick grand row in a dump down on barbary coast my mother was dead my dad was a high hatter he went back on me cold after that found my room locked when i went home i went back to ollie she kept me pretty straight for a while i ought to have married her and i know it before the kid was born but she was so jealous that she made life a living hell for me i well i wouldn t marry her it was her fault that i got sent up the second time she talked to a girl friend of hers and the girl snitched up to that time i think that ollie ricker talked more than any living woman she took a vow the day they got me that she d never speak an unnecessary word again in her life i ll say she s kept that vow pretty well i wish to god i d taken the same vow before i shot my mouth off about john the other day you don t think that i did it then i wished john could have seemed less eager on the square hubert answered i don t see who else could have done it that makes no never minds i wish i d kept my mouth shut on account of sam leave me out of it sam growled and forget it forget the whole damn thing if you can i m through if i hadn t been so busy playing the fool while martha was dying we could likely have saved her we ll never get any place with this thing nobody will look at us messing around with a lot of damn fool clues and suspicions telling one lie to cover another like a batch of gossiping old grannies while martha was lying there dying and me growling and snarling at her all afternoon i m a fool i m a damn sight worse i m an old fool a girl got killed on the desert moon ranch a boy killed himself for love of her the killer got clean away so far as i m concerned it is going to rest there i m closing the book soon as i can i ll sell out the damn place lock stock and barrel that doesn t go for me dad john said and i think you ll change your mind i m not willing to go on the rest of my life with half a dozen people thinking that i killed gabrielle no sir not with one person thinking it hubert hand seems to be in a sort of sentimental mood right now how long s he going to stay that way when he gets over it what s he going to do with the club he has in his hand nothing maybe depends on how much he might need some cash sometime in the future hubert said i m no damn blackmailer what did you serve your second term in prison for none of your business all right no hold on i ll tell you it s up to me to tell things to day and i m telling them it was forgery all right but just the same i don t feel yet like i was much to blame i d gotten in with a rotten crowd and never mind let it go at that here s another thing dad danny honestly believes that someway or other you are mixed up in this thing we can t marry with a thing like that between us i guess it doesn t make any difference in the way we feel toward each other but it makes a barrier just the same that will have to come down before we marry i haven t talked it over exactly with dan but i m dead certain she feels the same way i do about it you think danny is coming back here then hubert questioned how do you mean i m not looking for her to come back that s all you re crazy with the heat they read a telegram to me not an hour ago saying that she d get in on number twenty one friday afternoon i ll bet she s not on it say hand keep your shirt on john we all know that danny is innocent of the crime and that she is a good little scout a lot better than gaby was if not half as charming and attractive but she knows more than she wishes to know she knows more than she s going to tell maybe more than she can tell in safety for the love of mike folks couldn t you see that she had some reason for working up that case against sam cutting it out of whole cloth if she d been trying to shield john do you think she d have used sam for that purpose not on your life she wouldn t have she d have pinned it on me or mrs ricker or even on mary she did try to pin it on chad mrs ricker came tottering into the room sam jumped to meet her and helped her over to his own big chair at the head of the table she leaned forward her long black sleeved arms stretched straight in front of her over the white cloth her hands clenched into fists for hours she said i have been trying to reach a decision i have reached it i have come here to confess chapter xxxiii another confession before i came to the desert moon she began but hubert hand stopped her never mind ollie no need confessing as you say any of that sam knows all about us he d guessed it or most of it years ago i ve just now told him the rest it is all right with him i mean he realizes it s all long past he thinks as i do that the best thing we can do is to forget it and as he says keep on living straight and decent do you know all of our story mrs ricker lifted her faded eyes to sam enough sam sort of sighed it i don t care about details all but i was kind of wondering what became of the brown eyed baby named vera who the papers from the orphanage were made out for i found her a home with the mother and father of one of the nurses in the hospital they thought that she was my own child they loved her and were kind to her until she died during the influenza epidemic in san francisco in i sent half of my salary to them for her each month i always knew you were a good woman sam said now what do you say we forget it let by gones be by gones no said mrs ricker martha did not kill gaby as you think she did sam i killed her sam dropped his pipe there was another one of those dead awful silences the guilt mrs ricker went on is entirely mine all of my life i have been cursed with an abnormal jealousy and with the violent temper that usually accompanies such jealousy martha you all know possessed both of these traits a heritage from her mother without the balancing power of an adult mind she turned to hubert hand have you told about nina ziegelman no he spoke sharply i wouldn t ollie no need but i would she said and continued more rapidly about four months before martha was born a woman named nina ziegelman betrayed us hubert and me i had given her a confidence and she betrayed it when i found what she had done i went to her hotel room and tried to kill her i did not succeed i shot her but she recovered for many reasons of their own she and her friends proffered no charges against me i went free but i had marked martha for murder she was powerless against it as powerless as she would have been against any evil physical inheritance she can t be blamed no one could dare blame her for that it was i who planted those seeds of violence jealousy hatred and murderous intent who killed gabrielle martha was only the helpless instrument i was sorry that there was eagerness mixed with the pity in john s voice as he asked did martha tell you that she committed the murder no other parental heritages of hers were a lying tongue and slyness she persisted in her denials to me but it is all so evident gabrielle joined martha at the rabbit hutch you know how one sits down on one s heels to peer in at the rabbits in the low hutch i think gaby must have been squatting so when martha jumped at her and overpowered her martha was strong you know her hands were very strong you remember mary how she could open fruit jars that neither you nor i could budge she had hated gaby ever since gaby had come martha had said to me dozens of times that someday she thought she would kill gaby the marks on her throat i thought and so did the coroner looked as if she had been caught by someone who had been standing behind her seized unawares it would not take long to strangle a person martha must have done it in two or three minutes she took the bracelet then rolled the body under the clump of berry bushes right there and came straight into the house she showed no feeling of guilt because she had none at that moment we should all have suspected something we should have known that girl would not suddenly have given martha the bracelet later she told you about it didn t she sam and you left chad in the barn to hoodwink hubert and came up and hid the body for her by god i did not sam said no need to deny it now sam she said it was the deed of a good man martha was never responsible but courts might not have understood now we will all shield her keep her secret chad s confession will satisfy the world danny must know i suppose but no one else need ever know but i tell you sam shouted i don t know how without raising her voice she made it sound through his shouting and silence it but she did sam don t why can t we be honest now among ourselves you see i know that both you and martha were on those stairs when the body was put there my thoughts jumped out into words chad must have known it too he must have decided that he d rather die than betray either sam or martha he might have thought it sam said with a lack of emphasis that edged stupidity he could not have known it it is not true mrs ricker john questioned what makes you think that dad and martha had both been on the stairs sam s pipe ashes were strewn about and there was an old tatting shuttle with which i had been trying to teach martha to tat that morning she had it in her pocket it must have dropped out i think that mary tried to clean the pipe ashes away they were gone when i saw the body the second time i should have tried to do it but i didn t think i had no time i was frantic with fear wait she answered our looks and our exclamations of astonishment i will explain martha and i as you know were alone here in the house while the rest of you were out looking for gaby martha was sleepy i was worried about her sleeping so much and tried all sorts of ways to keep her awake until bed time i kept sending her out to look at the sky to see whether a storm was coming to spoil her fireworks she would run out and right in again to curl on the davenport and try to sleep finally though she stayed outside for a long time but for sam s pipe ashes i would think that then she had managed to drag the body upstairs by herself still though i believe that she did have strength enough to move the body i do not believe that she would have had wits enough when the wind rose i looked first for martha i called her several times before she answered finally she came around the house from the direction of the rabbit hutch again surely you must have noticed as i did that she had seemed strangely excited during all the late afternoon and early evening at the time i thought it was because she had been given the monkey charm and because she was to have the fireworks but when we were alone she talked very foolishly even for her she began with it again when she had answered my call she kept insisting that soon we were all going to be surprised about something something very nice that had to do with chad but she would never never tell what it was as a rule i should not have paid any attention to such talk but for some reason her excitement and her insistence about a surprise disturbed me i spent some minutes quizzing her i even tried to bribe her i could get nothing from her but further talk about the nice surprise at last i gave it up and ran upstairs to begin closing the house against the storm i thought i d begin with the attic and come down through the house i tried the attic door it was locked and the key was missing i was alarmed possibly because we were all disturbed concerning gaby s absence and possibly because inside doors are so seldom locked here i remembered the old skeleton key hanging in the broom closet i ran down and got it i opened the door i saw the body i touched it and knew even before i saw the tatting shuttle there and the beaded bag covered with sam s pipe ashes i snatched the shuttle and hid it in my dress at that instant through the open window at the end of the hall i heard your voices as you ran up the road from the garage to escape the rain i shut the door locked it and ran downstairs do you know when i met you i had that key in my hand mary came up to me to help me close the french windows i did not think i had a wild desire to rid myself of that key i was determined to protect martha at any cost mary s pocket was hanging like an open bag right below me i dropped the key into it it was a frightful mistake if i had kept it and thrown it away everyone in the house would have been exonerated it was as you know the one link that connected this household with the crime that is after mary had cleaned away the pipe ashes the little fleck or two of them which danny saw might have fallen there days before mary sam questioned were my pipe ashes on the bag did you stop to clean them off before you gave the alarm yes they were sam yes i did then sam said whoever put the body there put the pipe ashes there to throw suspicion on me and whoever it was knew my habits too he must have put the tatting shuttle there as well for good measure does anyone of you think that martha would have had the wits to save ashes out of my pipe and put them on the bag i tell you that would take an amount of logic of reasoning that martha could no more have managed than a kitten could chad john almost sang it in his eagerness he was wise enough and fool enough his one idea was to protect martha he helped her get the body up there between seven and eight o clock and he put the ashes there to shield her i said fool enough but come to think of it he knew what he was doing he was protecting her with the one person in the house who could not have done it with the one person that no nevada jury would convict then he turned around and shielded dad with his death and his written confession from start to finish it works out plain as day gosh say it is terrible gosh horrible think of it but thank god it is cleared up anyway cleared up anyway is right sam said and looked around at all of us pityingly like he d look at a litter of sickly puppies chapter xxxiv defense all satisfied then sam questioned all satisfied that martha killed her and that chad carried the body upstairs and hid it for her and left the false clues including the tatting shuttle for reasons unknown and came down merry and happy enough until he took a sudden notion to write a false confession and walk out and shoot himself through the head i was satisfied but i felt like a fool for so being when sam put it like that i said nothing hubert hand said it looks like a pretty clear case sam does what s become of your clear case against john unchanged tires and everything i had not heard ollie s story then dad there was pleading in john s voice you don t mean to say that you can t see the thing that you aren t satisfied with this absolutely logical explanation yes sam answered with his most dangerous drawl that s what i mean to say it takes more or seems to to satisfy me than it takes to satisfy some folks satisfied not by a damn sight john lost his temper for the love of pete why aren t you what would satisfy you say what are you trying to do do you like the case against me so well that you can t give it up you made us all come clean the other day or tried to come clean yourself now what have you got up your sleeve i ve got a couple of good fighting arms up my sleeve sam answered and i ve got a daughter dead in a grave up there since she was knee high to a duck she s counted on me for food and shelter and protection generally i don t know but i reckon she may still be counting on me somewhere not too far away for protection she is going to have it mrs ricker began to cry quietly but sam saw her no no mrs ricker he said don t get me wrong in this you believe that she was guilty i believe that she is innocent believing that way it is my bounden duty to clear her name it is my fault that she isn t here to stand up for herself it is my fault too i guess that i ve raised john so that he won t stand up for his own womenfolks that s rotten of you dad it is unfair i d stand up for martha till the cows came home but what s the use of bucking straight facts damn your straight facts we haven t got any i ve a few straight fact questions though that will blow this story galley west here s one of them does it stand to reason that for two months gaby lived right here unharmed by martha but that on the very day when she feared death from some outside enemy martha should kill her it is coincidental john admitted but just the same there are lots of coincidences we all meet them all the time it wasn t a coincidence that gaby was afraid of meeting when she walked out of this house on the fourth of july here s another question mrs ricker she says was plumb convinced that martha committed the murder and that i helped her by carrying the body upstairs afterwards she thought this the night of the murder and the next day and ever since why then didn t she come to me and anyway put out a feeler or two in my direction she knew that i d go as far to save martha as she would go i wouldn t protect john nor any other person on this place but martha was a child younger even than a child in some ways mrs ricker knew that i d save martha with my last dollar and as somebody said the other day with my last lie mrs ricker and i were alone together for more than half an hour the morning of the fifth why didn t she give me a hint then of any of this i i was afraid mrs ricker answered i was waiting i thought that you would give me the hint the sign i was not sure not sure then but sure now i tell you mrs ricker flared up i was afraid so long as she was living i was afraid of everything of everyone i was afraid of myself i dared not think i dared not look i scarcely lifted my eyes from my tatting i i was afraid now now sam said i see your point in that especially since talking had got you in bad once but see here i said a while ago that i d always known you were a good woman well i am going to keep on knowing it for the present there are enough folks around here to jump at conclusions without me doing it but you thinking as you say you think directly accused danny the other day that was not the act of a good woman god ollie hubert hand burst out he is going to try to pin it on you to save martha and the stanley name even yet you sam said are a liar safe enough i wouldn t fight you and you know it old man sam jumped to his feet i had to stumble over john but i managed to reach sam first and to stand in front of him boys boys i begged not here not in this house to night remember hubert stuck his hands in his pockets and walked away sam dropped into his chair the telephone bell in the other room began to ring chapter xxxv a visitor hubert answered the telephone and called to sam i followed him into the living room to hear what was to be heard i think that john and mrs ricker followed for the same reason when sam said read it please i knew that it was another telegram they telephone all of our telegrams to us from rattail and mail them later when they get around to it if they don t forget we had been pestered nearly crazy with telegrams on account of all the ruckus sam had stirred up about canneziano on the night of the murder i supposed this would be another one of them about some poor indian or other who had been found at a desert water hole but almost right away i could tell from sam s answers that this was about something different he kept writing things on the telephone pad and asking central to repeat and to repeat again and to spell that please lands but i got nervous before he finally hung up the receiver and turned to us and asked any of you ever hear of a fellow named lynn macdonald none of us of course ever had seems he is a kind of detective sam explained he calls himself a crime analyst and he specializes in murder cases works on his own hook kind of like sherlock holmes did i guess he had a list of references and past cases long as your arm they sounded fine i forget them now anyway he made a straight proposition he wants to come here and take the case he wants his expenses and nothing else if he fails if he succeeds he wants ten thousand cash poor fish i d have paid twenty thousand just as quick anyway that s a fair proposition it is the way i am used to trading money down if i deliver nothing if i don t i m going to wire him to come dad john objected you don t know a thing about this guy except what he tells you if you have to drag a detective into this now after what mrs ricker has told us why don t you wire to a reputable agency and have it send someone i like the tune this fellow sings i like the straight way he made his proposition when i wanted the best doctors for martha i always got specialists didn t i well this fellow s a specialist his references were damn good i like his name an honest scotchman comes pretty close to being the noblest work of god let s see danny is coming up on friday afternoon isn t she i ll wire macdonald to take the same train that will save us two trips to rattail in the heat listen dad sleep over it john urged i hated the quick sharp way both sam and hubert hand looked at him i hated him noticing it and jumping right into an explanation if mrs ricker is right about all this he said and i swear that i think she is isn t it enough for us to know about it dad if you get a detective here and he comes to the same conclusion we can t keep it a secret then sam said he won t and we aren t wanting nor needing any secrets on the desert moon just now he sat down and began to write the telegram five minutes and he was reading it to the operator at rattail he had just hung up the telephone receiver when the doorbell rang a long impudent ring nobody i thought as i went to the door with any sense of decency would ring our bell like that on this evening i was right for a minute i did not recognize the man standing there on the porch in the next minute i did recognize him my heart stood stock still he was daniel canneziano chapter xxxvi canneziano he pushed right past me into the room without waiting for an invitation he always was a polished up perfumed little fellow but that evening what with his gray spats and a cane he was right down dandified got a chap to drive me up from rattail he said beastly things these ford cars what he gave that explanation of how he had got up from rattail as if it were the only thing any of us could possibly be wondering about him or wanting to know i left my trunk down there he went on taking off his light gray overcoat and brushing it and folding it across his valise that he had set on a chair the ford chap couldn t bring it i thought you could send a truck down for it to morrow sam counting on paying us quite a visit eh canneziano sam found his voice at last trunk and everything as a matter of fact canneziano answered sitting down and making himself comfortable on the small davenport all that mess you stirred up about me on the night of the murder makes traveling not altogether agreeable for the present yes i think all things considered that having me for a guest after having set all the police in the country on my trail keeping me safely here as it were is about the least you can do isn t it i reckon i could do a little less in a pinch sam drawled but all things considered as you say though it might be you and i aren t considering the same things i m glad to see you here make yourself right at home for you may be going to stay even longer than you planned righto however if you have some neat little scheme of trying to pin the murder on me i d advise you to abandon it if i hadn t had water tight alibis all along the line keep your water tight alibis in a dry place till you need them sam advised maybe you will need them we ve got a crime analyst specialist in murder cases coming up here friday you can give your alibis to him that crime analyst sounds like lynn macdonald that s what she calls herself she sam said if you ve got lynn macdonald you ve got a woman hell sam exploded just the same canneziano said she s the best dic on the coast some say that she is the best in this country not that i give a hang but this is inside dope if anybody can find who killed the gaby this macdonald woman can you should hear some of the san quentin boys compliment her in their way we don t want a woman better wire her not to come dad john urged this time it was canneziano who looked quickly and sharply at john you re dead right you had he said if you don t want the murderer discovered sam hubert hand suggested you d better wire and verify her references anyway canneziano laughed i see what you are getting at i take it you ve all gotten pretty jumpy around here these last few days can t see the woodpile for the niggers now this gentleman by the by sam you are forgetting your manners i have not as yet met any of your guests thinks that this coming dic may be a pal of mine something of the sort if that were the case what good would it do to verify her references by wire the people you wired to would all answer that lynn macdonald was honest capable and so forth she s got a reputation around the bay that is hard to beat but if this were a plant jane jones or amaryllis de vere could come along just the same posing as lynn macdonald if you are really concerned about it why not have a burns man bring her up you shouldn t mind the extra expense sam there s generally more than one way to skin a cat sam said besides the way you are told to do it leaving us to think that over he went to the telephone and called the office of the morning record at telko and asked for mr clarence pette when he finally got him he asked him whether he knew lynn macdonald evidently he said that he knew who she was for sam told him to take number twenty one at telko friday afternoon and to meet him here and he would pay him fifty dollars for his trouble pretty work sam canneziano approved too bad i got you all so rattled as a matter of fact i rather fancy myself in the r le of a sleuth if lynn macdonald weren t coming i d like to take a try at this job myself for instance i noticed that though dan is in frisco now according to the papers none of you suggested that she meet lynn macdonald have her identified and bring her back here with her i am trying to decide whether that means that you don t trust the gentle dan or whether though the newspapers say she is to return at once to her home in nevada you do not expect her to return it means neither john snapped mr canneziano i said this is john stanley sam s adopted son he and danny are engaged to be married this other gentleman is mr hubert hand and the lady is mrs ricker things felt real polite for a minute as they always do just after folks have been introduced bad times you have been having around here lately canneziano said pleasantly as if he were talking about the weather mrs ricker excused herself and went upstairs chapter xxxvii strangler bauermont sam spoke directly to canneziano did you ever know a man named bauermont lewis bauermont strangler bauermont very well indeed has he anything to do with it what s that you called him sam asked sharply strangler bauermont you mean i remembered that danny had told me his nickname was mexico sam said that s what i mean how did he come by a name like that he is by way of being a wrestler i believe and won the name for some particularly clever hold that brought his man down every time i have never gone in for that sort of thing can t give you scientific details he was a jiu jitsu expert also oh no no as he noticed our quickening interests he is a continent and an ocean away at present moreover murder is quite outside his line quite and he was i believe rather smitten than otherwise with the gaby you are sure he is in europe now sam questioned i had a letter from him only a few days ago written and sent from deauville a cable to scotland yard would locate him precisely for you i have no doubt assuming of course that you don t mind spending a few dollars i suppose sam mused that he could easy teach his strangling trick to another man undoubtedly but isn t the entire connection rather foolish when one stops to think that strangler has been for years badly smitten with the lady i guess he got over that sam said seems now as if he was anxious to be shed of her oh ho and he famous for his constancy to the gaby nine ten i don t know how many years however though i ll grant his name belies it he was a smooth diplomatic cuss i think you can be practically certain that he would draw the line at murder under any circumstances that letter you had from him sam said i suppose you destroyed it i don t tie my letters into packets bound with blue ribbons was it written in code no you see the hotel where i was putting up just then was one might say over regulated letters written in code were not favorably regarded there could you read a letter written in his code i fancy so if you have a spanish dictionary there was nothing spanish about this one it was just a jumble of letters i don t know it then i m rather clever with codes however i fancy i could decipher it with a bit of study do they speak spanish in mexico i questioned and was rewarded by having all present look at me as if they thought that i had just developed a yearning for cultural geographical knowledge i am getting at something i explained was this bauermont man ever in mexico unfriendly persons canneziano answered insinuate that mexico is his native land did anyone ever call him mexico to his fury yes is it relevant sam asked where were you do you know at the time of the tonopah train robbery three years ago you were here right shortly after that i seem to remember i stopped for a friendly visit and you kicked me out and into my downfall at frisco my three years in the big house are at your door but i hold no grudge what i want to know is where were you at the time of the train robbery i was in denver since you insist was this strangler fellow there with you he was pardon my curiosity but is this leading to something i don t know do you this strangler friend of yours told the girls that you and he robbed that train canneziano s face went dark and ugly so the girls say ugh he told them that john said there was threat enough in his voice to make canneziano come off his perch is that possible he questioned but pleasantly enough i can t see his motive as a matter of fact when we read the accounts of how easily the thing had been pulled off we did rather regret that we had not taken a try at it ourselves if he had not included himself in his confession to the girls i would think that he had some friendly reason for preferring me in captivity no i don t get it we think he has denied it since sam said we think that the code letter which none of us can read is his denial no matter your story tots up straight enough with the one we have gratifying i am sure i wonder whether i might see this code letter as i ve remarked i ve a beastly habit of bragging i hope you don t mind i am rather clever with the things i went upstairs to get it i am not denying that it gave me the creeps to go into gaby s room alone at night when i opened the door and saw that the light on the table was lit and that someone was standing beside it i all but jumped out of my shoes it was mrs ricker she turned to me and apologized quietly for having startled me i was looking at these things she went on they know they were there if only one of them could talk i thought i am sure i spoke too tartly that you knew you said that you did sam doesn t believe it she answered doesn t that give me her mother a right to doubt if i can i was all out of sorts it would have been better to have doubted it in the first place i said i know but i didn t i couldn t sam does and then that man coming into the house to night i can t explain it but someway he made all of us even hubert seem so good the house itself felt to me do you understand good as if any wicked thing would have to come into it from the outside from far away just as he came into it to night i did understand i had had that feeling of drawing close to the others and away from him the minute he had come into the room but i was so put out with her for startling me and for being in gaby s room anyway poking around though land knows she had a right to be there and i might have done the same thing myself with my lists of clues and so on that i just said i supposed so and picked up the letter at the same time looking over the other things on the table to be sure nothing was missing perhaps she said i should not have come in here i suppose when the detective comes he she would like to see the room as nearly as possible undisturbed do you think it would be a good plan to lock it and to give the key to sam until she does come she went around with me while i locked the doors on the inside we had to lock the doors in danny s room too since the two rooms had only the curtained doorway between them we went into the hall through danny s room i locked that door after us she told me good night and went to her own room i went downstairs and gave the key and the letter to sam wise idea mary he said when i told him that i had locked the rooms i suppose canneziano would tell you though that locked doors do not a prison make he handed the letter to him looks rather confusing doesn t it canneziano said when he had unfolded and straightened the pages still these things are generally quite simple what price deciphering it sam no price to you sam answered he returned the letter to its envelope and tossed it on the table fair enough he said i fancy he questioned next that lynn macdonald is going to get rather a good thing out of this eh that depends on her success sam answered yes i understand that she takes jobs on that basis quite often it is not thoroughly approved in the best criminal circles too much incentive to frame a case however that theory of framing has been over exploited my proposition cards on the table is this if i beat the lady to it discover the murderer before she does will you pay me what you have agreed to pay her canneziano sam said get this get it now i ll pay you not one red cent for anything not one red cent fair enough canneziano repeated and my mistake undoubtedly i should have worded it differently for instance what will you pay me not to discover the murderer on the desert moon ranch a week ago sam would have got up and kicked him out through the door for that question this evening sam sat still and looked him over sort of sliding his eyes up and down over his smooth dapperness finally he drawled go as far as you like canneziano only you won t get anywhere you d like to be not on that line presently perhaps canneziano answered no hurry i ll be switched if sam didn t sit there and murmur mildly said the carpenter to himself chapter xxxviii lynn macdonald on friday afternoon late i went with john and sam down to rattail to meet the train when it came thundering snorting up i thought of the last time that sam and i had met a train together and of how our entire world had changed in the two months was it going to keep on changing i wondered i could not bear to look into the past i found that i did not dare to try to think into the future just before the train stopped with its usual roar of protest against rattail clarence pette swung off it he came over to us with a timid air like an animal just learning to eat out of a person s hand he took no risks until sam had greeted him real pleasantly and politely miss macdonald is on this train he said to sam and me is there anything else i can do for you not a thing if you are positive that she is miss macdonald except to take your fifty here it is and vamoose i m positive thanks here she comes now i looked up to see her coming i could hardly believe my eyes i don t know what i had expected but i surely had not expected anything to get off that smoke dirty train in the middle of a nevada desert on a sweltering hot july evening that looked as she did in the first place in her pongee silk dress with coat to match and perky little green hat she looked as if she had been fresh picked in the last nice california garden and had been kept under glass on ice ever since but that was only a part of it she looked too like linen sheets feel at the end of a long hard day sheets that have been hand washed and sun dried and dew dampened and ironed smooth as satin she looked like very early on a september morning in our mountains that was the zip and the zest of her combined with her comforting freshness and cleanness she was tall taller than most women and with weight enough to look durable and useful but not a mite fat she had eyes that were as gray as pussywillows and that did no monkey tricks of changing to green or blue she had wavy carrot colored hair that was so full of life it looked as if it were trying to break the bonds of its neat boyish bob and go floating off on its own to make maybe a tiny sunset cloud her nose was small her mouth was a mite too large showing freely in a smile her teeth little and polished white like a puppy s coming straight from san francisco she used no visible cosmetics which is much the same as if i had said rising out of the pacific ocean she was as dry as a chip but you could no more imagine lynn macdonald stopping anything much less herself to peer at her freckled nose in a vanity case s mirror than you could imagine a baseball player stopping between first and second base to take his temperature with a clinical thermometer all of this general satisfactoriness coming through the alkali dust and offering to shake hands with a person was i might say disarming my impulses were all mixed i felt like putting my old muddled head down on that nice high chest of hers and having a right good cry and yet i felt for the first time in days like a broad grin i managed it and forewent the other her voice was low and pleasant but there was something brisk and crisp about it and about all of her that seemed to say plenty and plenty of time for everything but not one precious minute to waste in the background during this meeting john and danny had been hugging and kissing as if the rolling train right behind them filled with staring people were a peaceful flowing river and the people fishes that were swimming past at last to my relief they came over to join us danny looking paler and more snuffed out than usual by contrast maybe with miss macdonald john beaming with triumph at having her home again but danny said after sam had introduced her to miss macdonald and had explained why miss macdonald had come you didn t tell me that you were coming here you girls get acquainted on the train sam asked we had breakfast together in the diner this morning miss macdonald answered did you know who i was danny questioned it was my business to know that wasn t it miss macdonald smiled only why didn t you tell me danny persisted i don t wonder that you ask miss macdonald said and i hope that you will forgive me for seeming unfriendly secretive it is simply that i never want my first history of the case to come from the nearest relatives of course they feel too deeply to see clearly mistaken impressions are so hard to eradicate that i go to any lengths to avoid them if i had made myself known this morning miss canneziano i should have had to seem more rude and ungracious than i seemed by acting as i did because please she included all of us in her glance i have to ask each of you not to talk to me about the case i should have to refuse to listen when i need to know anything about it i shall need to know many things i ll ask it as a direct question until i ask for more from you if you will all do that simply answer my questions you will help me immeasurably that s easy sam said i am afraid she answered that it won t be easy and i have to make another request that won t be easy to fulfill either it is that no one will question me i am sorry to have to ask that i am afraid that it seems as if i were trying to surround myself with a glamour of mystery pretending to false wisdoms and acumens not a bit of it sam interrupted he travels the fastest who travels alone i have always questioned that she said at any rate i don t intend to travel all alone you mean you are going to take a few days to size us up and then get some of us to help you sam asked question number one she said and laughed too chapter xxxix a trap we had got into the sedan by that time and were riding along the victory highway i declare to goodness a sound that was pretty much like a ripple of giggles went tittering around it did us good every last one of us it was antiseptic as laughs so often are just as i was thinking how much more wholesome everything felt since i had shaken hands with miss macdonald danny who was riding in the front seat beside john spoiled it all by emitting a shriek it was not a very loud one but it was thick with horror and repulsion john talked to her for a minute or two in a low voice and then explained over his shoulder to us that he had told her about that man being on the ranch uncle sam danny pleaded do i have to see him well danny sam apologized i m right down sorry about it but you see he is staying on the place we ll keep him out of your way as much as we can why can t he stay if he has to stay at all down at the outfit s quarters danny asked we ll see what miss macdonald says i kind of thought maybe she d like to have him where she could keep an eye on him i kind of wanted myself to keep an eye on him danny put her head on john s shoulder and began to cry weak choking little sobs that hurt like having to watch a sick baby poor little thing miss macdonald said to me her voice lowered and rich with sympathy i thought she would ask me what the trouble was and who the man was that was causing it instead still speaking low to me she said so often i get completely at odds with my profession and then i hear some woman crying like that or something else as heartbreaking comes to me and i know that i am justified not because i shall discover this criminal that won t help this little girl greatly but because i am one of an army that is fighting crime i didn t say it but i felt like telling her that she seemed like a whole army herself an army with banners i leaned forward and tried to sooth danny told her that we would all do what we could to keep him away from her and to make it easy for her it can t be made easy she answered you can t keep him away from me i won t see him i tell you i ve been so homesick and now to come home to this i can t see him i won t miss macdonald who the minute before had seemed all pity for danny began suddenly to talk right through and over her sobs to sam to talk in rather a loud voice about stock raising paying no more attention to danny s troubles than she paid to the humming of the motor i sat and sulked and nursed my disappointment if i had been a man which praise the lord i am not it would have been a case of love at first sight with me toward lynn macdonald but now i told myself bitterly that i had been a fool to expect real womanly sympathy and kindness from a person in her profession ferreting out criminals would make anyone as hard as nails i was right in a way that was not the last time i was to see her turn suddenly from a sympathetic woman into a crime analyst it was sort of a pity though that i had to see that side of her so soon so long before i could begin to understand it not until danny had quieted down and had turned to us with stammered apologies and attempted explanations did miss macdonald ask who is this man dreadful as it must seem to you danny answered he is my father but he has brought sorrow and fear and trouble to my mother and to my sister and to me whenever he came near us he is a wicked man wouldn t it be possible miss macdonald turned to sam to have someone go ahead of us to the house and ask him to keep to his own room this evening well sam hesitated but danny will have to meet him sooner or later better later in this case i should say she will be rested to morrow possibly too it would be easier for her if their first meeting could be in private shouldn t you rather see him alone just at first miss canneziano oh no danny exclaimed i hope i need never see him alone please don t any of you ever leave me alone with him not for a minute if you can help it for all the fuss she had made about it i will say that danny did very well when we all went into the house and she saw canneziano standing over by the east windows smoking a cigarette what ho dan he said smiling his smooth smirking smile at her you are looking seedy bad times around here lately she didn t go near him she edged closer to john but she answered looking at him straight and lifting her chin in a pretty dignified way she had very very bad times indeed she and john walked through the room to the stairway and up the steps and out of sight canneziano stood watching them a dark ugly look on his face there s filial affection for you he said and then with a half laugh as he lit another cigarette and shook the flame from the match the girl is a fool chapter xl the missing box miss macdonald came down to breakfast in the morning trim and white as a new candle she ate heartily complimenting the food she asked after danny who had not come down for breakfast she talked about how splendidly the high altitude and the marvelous nevada air made her feel she told us who had lived here all our lives and didn t know it that the air in nevada was supposed to be the best in the entire united states for growing things and all the time she was either not noticing or pretending not to notice how we were all hanging on her every word and watching her every movement i guessed the others were doing as i was doing watching for penetrating glances and listening for catches in her innocent questions but at that i blushed for them particularly for john who sat and stared at her as if she were something he had to learn by heart before the meal was over she caught him at it several times but though he would then have the grace to blush and go glancing about he d begin again at the beginning the minute she looked away when we had finally finished breakfast she asked sam if she might detain him i stayed on when the others had left the dining room she said pointedly though politely and to sam not to me that she wanted to speak to him alone i took myself off but the open window in the pass pantry was too big a temptation so i went in there softly and stood far back and to the side her very first words took me right off my feet mr stanley she questioned do you trust your housekeeper mary sam drawled well now i don t know as to trusting i don t know how to express what my feelings were when i heard sam say that pulverized is a word that would edge it i guess as if i had been caught in a sausage machine and ground up into small pieces each one hurting on its own hook but sam continued if mary was going on a long journey to indefinite foreign parts and felt the need of my right eye to take along with her i d loan it to her for as long as she wanted it no questions asked i can t say that i d go much further than that though i was whole again and warm and glowing sam the old ninny getting his dander up and to a beautiful woman like that just because she had asked him a simple question she laughed a cheery escaping sort of laugh like something with bright wings suddenly flying loose come back into the dining room then mrs magin she called to me you can hear better in here i came in a mite shamefacedly it was my overweening curiosity i explained sam murmured satiable i like people with curiosity she said i understand them too because i suppose i am one of the most curious persons in the world another thing i have never found a truly curious person who was a wicked person as much as any generalization can be made all criminals are egotists curiosity means interest in the affairs of others of course one has to be able to discriminate between innate curiosity and the slyness of self protection but forgive me mr stanley i am chattering away your time now then later we became accustomed to that brisk professional opening of hers that now then as a signal for getting right down to business but it was as surprising heard for the first time as biting your tongue gabrielle canneziano was last seen alive where and at about what hour we told her did she seem at ease happy untroubled sam said i was playing chess i didn t notice i did i said she was unhappy troubled and frightened frightened are you positive that you had that impression at the time yes i spoke to mrs ricker about it right then did she agree with you then she didn t say did gabrielle canneziano speak to any one of you as she walked through the room i told her about gaby s gesture to chad and about him following her to the porch and talking to her there chadwick caufield the man who killed himself when the body was found yes did he leave the porch with her no he came straight back into the house what other members of the household were in the room at that time sam told her that leaves her sister and your son and daughter as the only members of the household who were absent at the time how long before martha stanley returned to the house sam said i was playing chess but i know it wasn t long it wasn t more than five or six minutes i said how long before danielle canneziano came downstairs i told her about danny s calling after gaby it wasn t much more than ten minutes after she called not fifteen minutes i am sure before danny came downstairs since you are a cook she said you probably have more than the average ability in estimating time good cooks i told her don t estimate they know when i m boiling three minute eggs i use my watch and always have at least then she said you know how difficult it is to deal accurately with minutes with every desire and reason to be honest five minutes in the testimony of a witness may be anything from two minutes to seventeen ten minutes anything from five minutes to twenty three twenty minutes anything from nine minutes to forty five forty five minutes anything from twenty odd to an hour and a half now then she went on with her questioning we had finished breakfast at eight thirty o clock at eleven thirty i felt that she knew everything that sam and i knew about the case and probably a deal more she knew about the two girls searching for something she knew about gaby s getting the code letter about her peculiar actions afterwards she knew about the quarrel with sam she knew about john having gone to rattail for medicine that danny said she had not sent for she knew about him taking four hours instead of two to make the trip about the reasons he had given for that about him going straight upstairs the back way and staying there for half an hour in answer to her questions it was sam and not i who told her about john s acting so bothered and troubled when he came down for supper she knew about all of our actions between five and six o clock she knew that sam was unwilling to swear that hubert had been in the barn during that entire time sam insisted upon telling her about danny s suspicions concerning himself that he had left chad the ventriloquist in the barn to hood wink hubert and had gone off somewhere she knew about me asking chad to close the attic about the locked door the key in my pocket she knew that i had found the body and had stopped to clean away sam s pipe ashes she had seen the note that chad had left she had compared it through her magnifying glass with other specimens of his handwriting she had stated positively that the note had been written by the same hand that had written the names and jokes under the pictures in his kodak album she had spent ten minutes or more looking at these pictures then she had asked sam to explain in detail why he had entirely discounted chad s note of confession sam said the body was cold and stiff when we found it that is proof isn t it that she had been dead more than an hour if you are certain of that it is positive proof that she had been dead much longer than one hour i am certain well until seven o clock that boy had not been out of my sight for one minute after gaby walked through the room alive for us all to see her at four o clock twice miss macdonald objected you have told me that you could not answer a question because at the time you were absorbed in your chess game how then can you be certain that chadwick caufield was not out of the living room for a short time say fifteen minutes between four and five o clock because he was playing the piano all that time you are certain that you would have noticed it had he stopped playing certain he was spoiling my game and driving me half crazy with his noise i kept hoping that he would stop kept forcing myself not to ask him to stop why shouldn t you ask him if it was annoying you to that extent in your own home well it was chad s home too he had as much right i reckon to play his music as i had to play my chess game i liked the look miss macdonald sidled at me when sam said that you too are sure she questioned me that chadwick caufield was at the piano during that entire hour i know it what sort of music was he playing he was improvising it was happy cheerful sort of crooning music if you know what i mean yes he did not seem worried depressed not a bit he seemed happier than usual i thought she went on with her questions they brought us to martha s death she took what seemed like a long time asking us questions about martha s health had she ever complained of dizziness shortness of breath indigestion and all sorts of other seemingly unimportant things where she finally came back to the powders again was this sleeping medicine purchased sam told her in san francisco with a doctor s prescription have you still some of them left in the original box a few i think good will you get it for me mr stanley i ll get it i said and my opinion of her as a detective was lowered then and there if she had not found out by this time that it was useless to send a man to look for anything anywhere but most particularly in a bathroom medicine closet she still had too much to learn i had seen the powder box left out of place on the table the morning of the fifth of july when i had gone into the hall bathroom i had picked it up out of habit and replaced it in the medicine closet i thought that i could put my hand right on it i could not when i opened the mirror door the box was not to be seen i searched and searched i might have spared myself the trouble from that day to this the box with the remaining powders in it has never been found chapter xli questions i was afraid of that miss macdonald said when i returned with my information and nothing else to the dining room now then would it be possible for you to remember who last took one of these powders and when with no ill effects danny and mary each took one the night of the fourth when martha did sam answered i ve asked them about it and both of them say that they did not feel queer at all afterwards they were both wide awake in the morning my word said miss macdonald i think i offered that something was all wrong with martha s heart before she took the powder she acted sleepy stupid all afternoon from noon on you mean no at least i didn t notice until later in the afternoon mrs ricker said that she had a hard time keeping her awake between seven and eight o clock i see mrs ricker did not take one of the sleeping powders that night she didn t need one sam explained she is naturally calm she didn t go all to pieces like the other girls did and yet i have gathered that she was far from calm when her daughter died she went clear raving crazy i said yes now then hold on a minute sam said i think that you think from the questions you have been asking that the sleeping powder like i gave the other girls would not have caused martha s death now i want to know i am sorry mr stanley she interrupted but i have explained that i can not answer questions suppose i insist on a few common sense questions being answered right now you can t do that you can hamper me in my progress you can dismiss me from the case right now but you aren t going to do either are you i won t hamper you if i can help it i won t dismiss you as you say now either it wouldn t be right without giving you a chance after you came all the way up here and you know it that s why you should try to be reasonable i am trying to be reasonable mr stanley her smile at sam just then looked as if she might be trying to be something a mite more charming than reasonable besides now then she was off again leading us with her questions through mrs ricker s confession and her suspicions of martha after martha came into the house with the bracelet she asked was she out of the room again within the hour or even within the second hour between five and six she was not out between four and five i said she might have been any place for all i know between five and six i was in the kitchen did you have any particular reason for watching her between four and five o clock no then i am afraid that you can not be positive that she did not leave the room i am positive i insisted there weren t any goings nor comings we all stayed right in the room it was too hot to move around i know that martha did not leave the room she sat beside chad on the piano bench for a while she sat on the arm of sam s chair watching the chess game gosh sam said i remember that now she was fooling with my hair i kept smelling the blacking on her shoes you couldn t have i said because sam she was wearing white shoes she used some preparation to clean her white shoes i suppose miss macdonald asked some stuff called white o clean we all use it she asked for the bottle when i brought it she smelled of it and asked sam to is that the odor you noticed she questioned nothing like it now then hold on sam said i ve got two things to tell you that you are overlooking and i know that they are both mighty important what are they the first one is this gaby had lived here close to two months martha had never harmed her does it stand to reason that on the very day gaby was afraid she was going to be killed martha would do it there s too much coincidence in that isn t there i think so she answered breaking her rule for once at least though we can not ever discount coincidence in the first place what appears to be coincidence usually proves not to be coincidence at all in the end in the second place genuine coincidences are much more frequent than is generally supposed or admitted but mr stanley unless the other thing you have to tell me is a fact and not an opinion i am going to ask you not to tell it to me at least not until later it is straight fact very well then i d rather show you sam said then you wouldn t have to take my word for it will you come out to the rabbit hutch with me but she questioned can that be necessary you can judge for yourself martha was always trying experiments with feeding her rabbits i guess she thought that they might like grain maybe they do i don t know anyway she or someone had tugged a half sack of grain up there a lot of it had spilled out under the berry bushes it is all fresh sprouted and growing fine is that important or not her brows puckered i m sorry i don t follow you there wasn t a spot out there except under those bushes where martha could have hidden the body a body even as small as gaby s would have smashed down and broken those fresh sprouts of grain but the body was never there mrs ricker said that she thought it was we just told you her mouth popped open with surprise but mr stanley you couldn t have considered mrs ricker s opinion seriously is it possible that you don t know that gabrielle canneziano was murdered right there on the stairs where she fell and where she was found chapter xlii a revelation how in blazes could i know it sam said what s more i don t believe it i think that she was murdered outside and carried in afterwards my word weren t you present when the body was moved no i well i didn t care about being the fingers of her right hand were clutching the stair tread with the grasp of death nothing can disprove that dead fingers can not be made to clutch how do you know that sam demanded about her fingers i mean to prove to you she said after an instant s hesitation that my refusal to answer questions is not merely an attempt to appear wise and mysterious i am going to answer this question when i saw the body in the crematory in san francisco what i always do that when i can before i sent you my telegram i had gone to see the body did does danny know that no it might be better not to tell her it is a necessary part of my profession the crematory people realize that but since people are often very sensitive about it they prefer that the relatives should not know that they allow it as i was saying i saw then that the fingers on the right hand had been broken the undertaker had done that you understand in order that they might look natural to fold when i had received your telegram engaging me to take the case i telephoned to the coroner and the undertaker in telko i asked them to come to the train and talk with me for the twenty minutes that the train stops in telko i took a drawing room for the purpose so that we could talk undisturbed and unnoticed that will be the reason for the day s drawing room charge on my expense account mr stanley i don t want you to think that i was unduly extravagant extravagant hell sam exploded forgetting himself what do i care about a drawing room what i want to know is what those fellows told you and why they didn t tell me they corroborated the opinion i had formed from the fingers about the death clutch among other things i don t know why they didn t tell you that probably because they assumed that you already knew it what information i got from them they gave with extreme reluctance due i think to their long standing friendship with you and their desire not to incriminate any member of your household i got nothing from them or to put it more fairly perhaps they were able to tell me nothing except the facts concerning the position of the body those facts proved that she had been killed on the stairs by someone who had been coming downstairs behind her how did it happen that you did not know this as soon as i realized what had occurred sam explained i cleared everybody right out and locked the door i knew that it was necessary for the coroner to examine the body before it had been disturbed how very very sensible miss macdonald said but i did not quite like the way she said it if you mean i spoke up how unfeeling i want to say that though she had been living here for two months she had not exactly endeared herself to any of us no i had understood that chadwick caufield was deeply in love with her that mr hand was more or less enamoured there can be no doubt that her sister loved her devotedly that leaves mr stanley his son and daughter mrs ricker and yourself as the people to whom she had not endeared herself sam and i received that in silence it was one of those odd things that was true but that did not sound so i looked at my watch and said that it was time for me to be starting to get dinner she asked if she might help me i thought that she was trying only to be polite and i was making my refusal just as polite when she interrupted me please mrs magin she urged you mentioned at breakfast that you had only one inefficient girl to help you just now i love housework of all sorts and i want to get intimately acquainted with this house the best way to do that is to work in it isn t it you know you can t know a stove until you have cooked on it nor a room until you have cleaned it won t you let me help you as a special favor to me sam winked at me she isn t going to let you out of her sight mary miss macdonald tried to smile but she made a failure of it but you don t need to worry mary sam went on because one thing now is dead certain if gaby was murdered there on the steps it is impossible that any member of this household could have done it it was anyway but now it is sure that clears us all miss macdonald flashed out in one of her rarely shown tempers what utter nonsense she said chapter xliii a shadow when it came to helping in the kitchen that girl was more help in five minutes than belle sadie and goldie all three of them together had been in half a day she didn t ask questions she didn t say where is this and how do you do that she pitched in as if she had been working in that kitchen with me for the past twenty years how she knew where i kept the potatoes where the best paring knife lived and the particular kettle that was best for cooking the potatoes in i don t know and i never shall know most mystery stories especially of late have an element of the supernatural in them i tell you that girl s knowledge of my ways and the manner in which she took hold in the kitchen are as supernatural as anything ever brought to my notice the first thing i knew she was peeling the potatoes and peeling them thin and clean she didn t ask how many would be enough when she got them peeled and washed she put them on in boiling water with no inquiry as to where i kept the salt she did not talk as she worked i was glad of that for after three solid hours of conversation i needed badly a silent space i wanted to think those last words of hers utter nonsense in answer to sam s statement kept ringing in my ears i tried to think whether there was any way a person could get upstairs without coming through the house we had no fire escapes there were no trees close enough to the house so that even douglas fairbanks could swing to an upstairs window from one of them there were no vines growing on the house without about a twenty foot ladder which we didn t have on the place and which would be hard to go conveying about to say nothing of disposing of it afterwards there was not any possible way for anyone to get to the second floor of our house except by means of the back or the front stairway since gaby had been killed on the attic stairway and since all who knew about that sort of thing agreed that she had been dead at least two hours when we found her she must have returned to the house sometime between four and five o clock and have stolen upstairs with none of us seeing or hearing her since she could do that there was no reason to suppose that someone else could not have done the same thing either coming in with her at the time or coming before or after she did i had to conclude that another person certainly had done just that had entered the house and had gone upstairs during that hour who the person whom she had been fearing not one of us that seemed a certainty and yet miss macdonald had said nonsense i remembered again her strange mad actions immediately after she had received the code letter i remembered how she had looked in the hall that day when i had told john that i thought i had seen the ghost of sin in gaby s note to danny she had written that she had purposely kept her fears and her danger a secret from danny undoubtedly the secret was written in the code letter had she told danny partly the truth about the contents of that letter or had she told her falsehoods from beginning to end or had danny told us only a part of the truth why did we all keep forgetting how danny had tried to call gaby back when gaby had started on that fatal walk i have said before and i say again i knew that danielle canneziano had not murdered her sister but i knew too that if she had some reason some better reason than i could conceive for keeping quiet for not telling everything she knew danny was capable of so doing i remembered our talk in her room on the morning of the fifth of july i remembered how she had acted when her engagement ring had slipped from her finger and i tried to turn my thoughts into different channels there was chad s suicide and his confession it could be possible that he had killed himself because he had loved gaby but that would not account for his confession to the crime it could mean but one thing a desire to shield someone would he have cared about shielding some unknown scoundrel who had crept into the house and killed the girl whom chad loved had chad then mistakenly suspected martha or sam or john and killed himself and left the note to aid one of them not likely men do not kill themselves leaving a written confession to a crime of which they are innocent because of some mere suspicion i remembered my conversation with hubert hand in the hall that morning what was it that he had thought i had overheard in the cabin and had bribed me not to tell it was reasonable enough to suppose that at that time he had hoped to keep his entire story his prison records his reason for coming to the desert moon his relations with mrs ricker and martha a secret just as i had hoped to keep the fact of finding sam s pipe ashes a secret sam s pipe ashes again if someone had put them there in an effort to implicate sam it would have had to be someone who knew sam s ways my thoughts were off again you can t i told myself get shed of a following shadow by running away from it you have to turn and face it before you can go the other way i faced it john he had left the ranch at two o clock he could easily have gotten back by four or shortly after suppose that he had left the machine down the road quite far down the road in the spot where the tire tracks showed that the machine had been stopped and started again the spot where we thought he had changed a tire he could have climbed the fence taken a short cut to the house and gotten here in half or three quarters of an hour he could have met gaby could have stolen into the house with her he could have killed her and stolen out of the house again a short cut across the fields and a drive to the house would get him here by six o clock the time he did get here if he could be wicked enough to murder he could be wicked enough to arrange clues to throw suspicions on his father and his sister if he were low enough to do that he would be low enough to rob her of a little money in other words grant that john is a blonde and you can go along and grant that he has blue eyes and tow hair it was all of it false i told myself from its wicked beginning to its wicked end false and unfair but i had faced it now i could turn and go in another direction i had not realized how deeply i had been thinking dawdling over my work in consequence until i saw that miss macdonald had taken up the pork chops and had them in the warming oven and was making gravy as smooth and tasty looking pan gravy as i ever saw good lands i said i ve certainly come to one conclusion it is a little early for conclusions isn t it she asked it is a lot too late for this one please she began but for once i got the best of her my conclusion is i said that by hook or crook sam stanley has got to get me some efficient help in this house when i think of what i ve put up with all these years in the way of help and then see the way you pitch in it makes me mad all over i wish she said that i might drop this case right now and stay here for all time and be your assistant and a thoroughly domestic person and forget that there were crimes and criminals in the world maybe i said eagerly but knowing of course that it was too good to come true when you ve finished with this case you could do that you d be one of our family and sam would pay well i guess anything you d care to ask no she smiled it is tempting now but that desire of mine to give up my profession is a phase that i always pass through at the beginning of each difficult case in a few days when i begin to get hold of something and when things begin to take shape all my love of the work will return it is only at first when i seem to be in a maze of mystery like this that i get so discouraged i always do it right at first and i always think that here is the case of which i am going to make an absolute failure have you ever failed on a case i asked indeed i have on several it is queer though in each case that has been a failure it has seemed that the solution was written plainly from the start it was written all wrong judging from that i should be unusually successful in this case poor girl no wonder that she was discouraged she has given me leave now that it is all over to use any of her notes that i care to use in the writing of this story far be it from lynn macdonald she said when i asked her about using the notes to refuse advertisement of one of her banner cases my rivals will say that i succeeded in this because as often happens my luck stood by me but you and i we understand about luck don t we mary if you aren t afraid i said that your notes may give away some of the secrets of that luck of yours so that your rivals will be able to lay their hands on some of the same brand she laughed i never write down a secret that is a safe enough rule for an honest person who plans to remain honest for a dishonest person or for one who contemplates any sort of evil or admits the possibility of such a course the safe rule would be never under any circumstances put pen or pencil to paper as sam would say it is a poor rule that won t work both ways the notes that miss macdonald had made before this conversation of ours that day in the kitchen and on the evening of that same day july eleventh are as follows chapter xliv the notes july saw body in crematory late to night cause of death strangulation probably work of expert look for japanese on ranch broken fingers on right hand beautiful costly gown lingerie etc indicating wealth and good taste july rose who has shadowed twin sister reports nothing verging on suspicion she attended services at crematory evidence of genuine grief returned to hotel one telegram sent to desert moon ranch received no company mailed no letters did no shopping i received telegram from desert moon ranch engaging me on case explicit directions concerning train probably due to inconvenience of meeting trains in rural community and not due to a desire to have me on the same train with miss c however note telephoned to coroner and undertaker requesting them to give me conference in telko also had coroner verify list of names as published in examiner of all persons present on ranch at time of murder note absence of all ranch employees at the time note extreme reluctance of both coroner and undertaker to give information or to meet me in telko july spent day in shadowing miss c myself r s observations as usual excellent rose s research through back files of nevada papers provided following information samuel stanley ranch owner very wealthy exemplary character high standing throughout state of nevada philanthropic john stanley adopted son of s stanley distinguished himself on university of nevada football team enlisted in air service for war mather s field when armistice was declared hubert hand winner of chess tournament held in reno mrs ollie ricker no report chadwick caufield no report except mention as guest at desert moon ranch mary magin no report danielle canneziano no report except mention of her arrival with sister gabrielle at ranch last may inspection of miss c s room in hotel after she had turned in her key revealed no clue unusually neat and orderly person wastebaskets empty newspapers folded on table magazine ladies home journal on table no heavy perfume hotel soap unwrapped fastidious silver dollar left on table for chambermaid rose reports miss c went from hotel to ferry building in taxicab crossed alone on ferry spoke to no one boarded train at eight thirty o clock and went at once to her berth july afternoon breakfasted with miss c this morning no conversation all the evidences of good breeding had conference with coroner and undertaker think that they strongly suspect john stanley because of their repeated efforts to keep me from sharing the suspicion information gained from them girl murdered on attic stairway position of body and marks on throat prove an attack from the rear members of household declare that rigor was complete when body was discovered at eight o clock the night of the fourth of july amateur testimony however if fact death must have occurred at least three hours before discovery of body july night allowed sudden hunch to betray reason and common sense usual silly mistake at beginning of case set a trap to catch hawk got caught myself luckily no harm done met members of household first impressions before hearing history of case other than gained from newspapers coroner and undertaker danielle canneziano impressions previously noted sustained charming lovable character innocent samuel stanley honest likable kindly there is a slight chance that he might be involved unwittingly he is not stupid but decidedly he is not clever mary magin intelligent imaginative honest innocent john stanley too handsome but unconceited bashful likable judgment suspended hubert hand egotistic clever judgment suspended ollie ricker life has treated her badly she has put on armor against it stupid perhaps sly judgment suspended daniel canneziano criminal type alibi proves him not guilty of the murder but he is probably involved why did he come here july evening heard case history to day from mr s and mrs m tempted to destroy all first impressions as recorded remember however the value of mistaken impressions is usually important multiplicity of clues most amazing in my entire experience would seem to indicate that many of them are false clues most important clues definite john s unnecessary errand a length of time gone unusual costume for short walk on the place a proof of her fear missing box containing sleeping powders caufield s suicide and confessional note probably most important of all clues victim s note to danielle canneziano a proof of her fear death of martha stanley a missing box containing sleeping powders canneziano s presence on the ranch clues of less importance definite contents of beaded bag a empty purse b missing bill fold c crumpled handkerchief d broken cigarette holder e note from hubert hand f cigarette case with two cigarettes missing g empty matchbox code letter a destroyed caps for typewriter pipe ashes on bag and carpet a not necessarily mr stanley s b probably fixed false clue tatting shuttle doubtful clues of most importance indefinite entire story concerning the money from robbery being hidden on desert moon ranch victim s peculiar actions after receiving code letter a quarrel with mr stanley mrs ricker s story a her reason for telling it b did she believe it mrs magin s desire to remove pipe ashes miss c s reluctance to tell of them her final complete confession of her suspicions concerning mr stanley hubert hand s unnecessary confession concerning his past life clues of least importance indefinite c caufield s powers of ventriloquism a probably greatly over rated by members of household playing of radio between two and four o clock that afternoon martha s reference to a surprise in which she and chadwick caufield were involved a possibly untrue mrs magin s evident antagonism toward the victim mr stanley s prompt action in locking the attic door and his refusal to have the body touched until the arrival of coroner reason for victim s having given bracelet to martha stanley at that time negatives no clues of any sort discoverable in victim s room no clues of any sort discoverable in attic lack of motives for crime by persons at present instinctively suspicioned no dogs on a ranch of this size now as i read over these notes my good opinion of myself rises until it runs over the pan i declare to goodness the list of clues made out by lynn macdonald crime analyst is not much better than the list made out by mary magin cook and housekeeper she has done hers in better form and she has included a few things that i left out but most of the included things were unknown to me at the time i made my list many of the other included things did not amount to shucks for instance we have no dogs on the ranch because the dogs in northeastern nevada have a habit of running out and associating with rabid coyotes contracting rabies coming home and biting whoever is conveniently to hand for instance but never mind as i said before poor girl no wonder she was discouraged chapter xlv another key as indicated by her notes for july eleventh on that afternoon miss macdonald had cleaned the attic thoroughly and had found nothing to pay her for her trouble keeping me in the dark as she had i supposed when she said early the next morning that she wanted to clean the living room that she had got at least a hat full of clues from the attic land knows the way i had been neglecting things the living room was badly in need of a good cleaning i wanted her to allow me to help her but she would not it was luck that i happened to come in with the floor wax just as she was looking at something that she had dug out of the ashes in the fireplace what s that i questioned i believe she answered that it is the missing key to the attic door she got up shook out her skirts and went straight upstairs i trailed along i stood by and watched her while she fitted the blackened key into the lock it turned both ways as smoothly as you please without bothering to say anything to me she went up and down the hall trying the key in the locks of the other doors it fitted none of them she went downstairs again with me trailing after her and tried the key in all the locks downstairs it fitted none of them either do you know she asked showing at last that she was conscious of my presence which i was beginning to doubt when you last had a fire in that fireplace i thought a minute and then told her on the night of the fourth of july during the storm do you remember who kindled the fire it had been fixed there ready for the match for weeks things have gone to rack and ruin here lately but i always used to see to it that the fire was set in the fireplace ready to light when needed do you happen to know who applied the match to the fire that night sam did but surely even though the rain had come up a fire on the fourth of july could not have been necessary we don t have fires here when they are necessary i told her we have them when they are possible without absolute suffocation half a pint of rain is plenty of excuse for sam to light a fire at any time even if he has to open all the doors and the windows to cool off what i was saying was the honest truth but i had a mean feeling that she didn t believe me right here with apologies to miss macdonald and others of her profession i want to say that if they would just remember that nine times out of ten a person who pretends to be telling the truth is telling it it would save them a lot of mistakes and a lot of worry the man who spends his time biting his money to see whether or not it is genuine doesn t usually have much of it to bite to say nothing of the wear and tear on his own teeth which would be considerable i was standing by the living room windows trying to keep my temper down with some such consoling thoughts as these when i saw a car drive up and the coroner and the undertaker getting out of it i told miss macdonald the news and asked her what in the world she supposed they were coming here for at this time in the morning i needed to see them again she answered mr stanley telephoned to them last evening well i said that means that i ve got about half an hour to disguise a family meal as a company dinner don t bother she interrupted they won t be here for luncheon dinner i need to see them only about ten minutes i didn t bother answering if she didn t know any more about the ways of people in this country than that i didn t see why i should take it on myself to teach her but she was right she talked to them a few minutes and though i insisted that they stay for dinner off they went it was an insult to the desert moon ranch everyone on the place but miss macdonald knew it two weeks before if a couple of friends had left the ranch at eleven thirty in the morning with no reasonable excuse for so doing sam would have blown up and burst with rage that noon he was not even decently indignantly interested he had plenty of interest though concerning the finding of the attic key he had had it all settled and was satisfied that since it had been proven that gaby had been killed on the stairway it had also been proven that no member of the household could have been implicated now this second key coming to light the key that must have been put over back of the wood before the fire was lighted that night and that must have been blackened in that one fire because there had been no fire in that fireplace since dragged to quote sam not wishing to use such words on my own hook every damn one of us back into the damn mess again sam i said and i guess my only excuse is that i was still angry at having my honest word doubted do you know what i think i think that miss macdonald though land knows she is a nice girl and a living wonder as help in the kitchen and around the house is going to be a flat fizzle from start to finish when it comes to discovering the murderer that s kind of the way i got it sized up too sam said but if she s good help to you she s worth a lot more than her expenses it isn t the cost of her i said i m afraid she is going to do a lot of harm around here good night mary he said if anyone can do any more harm around here than has been done already why leave em do it not much with your leave em do its i said my idea is that we ve had about enough trouble what i m getting at is this sam i think that fool girl at present is suspecting you more than any other one of us that s the way i had that sized up too he said but let her go ahead if she can prove i m guilty i m willing to hang for it don t be a fool sam i snapped did you ever happen to hear of circumstantial evidence you bet but they can t hang more than one innocent person on circumstantial evidence and there s enough of that stuff around here now to hang about five or six of us i ll take my chances with the rest of you mary lands sam i was taken aback do you think she suspects me something pretty close to the old twinkle came into sam s eyes well mary gaby was one extra to do for and she came late to meals and pestered you quite a lot furthermore though it hasn t been made a point of you were all alone in the kitchen for the hour between five and six o clock you might have slipped up and have done the deed between the time you put the meat on and took the biscuits out i knew that he thought he was being funny but i didn t like it see here sam i began danny was going back and forth all the time now then sam interrupted mocking miss macdonald did miss canneziano have any particular reason for watching you no i see then i am afraid she can not be positive that you were not out of the kitchen twenty minutes often seem like two hours and sixteen minutes i ll tell you what mary sam got suddenly serious i m going to wait a few more days and then if this lady isn t progressing a deal faster than she is at present i m going to pay her off full amount of course and wire to frisco for a plain ordinary he man detective to come up here and take hold of things by the way he went on does it seem to you that danny and canneziano are getting along all right i judge it isn t a case of their getting along much i said so far as i know she hasn t spoken a word to him since she greeted him the evening she came home well he hesitated well i know a mite further than that i ll tell you sometime that isn t dinner time maybe he went into the dining room and i followed him all during that dinner and the same had been true of every meal since the first breakfast i ve mentioned john hardly took his eyes off of miss macdonald i made a way to speak to him about it alone right after dinner john i said for mercy s sakes what do you want to sit and stare at miss macdonald for during meals like she was the place where you had lost something he blushed gosh mary i haven t been doing that have i you certainly have it doesn t look nice john why do you do it i didn t know that i did but on the square did you ever see anything as pretty i mean as clean and well kind of comforting looking she changes so too like a diamond or a desert or a sunrise or something did you ever see anyone as interesting to look at mary never mind asking me i said just you go and ask danny some of those questions danny he answered is well danny is danny of course she s different better take to watching how different she is i advised and left him to think it over and went into the living room canneziano was loafing around in there mary he said i ll make a dicker with you chapter xlvi a dicker not with me i said and started up the stairs curiosity like mine is a curse i d gone about four steps up when it caught me what s your old dicker i said if you ll persuade sam to give me the ten thousand for producing the murderer i ll split it with you i am tired of apologizing for myself i will state merely that i managed to say the one thing under those circumstances that i should not have said do you know who the murderer is thereby proving that i was possessed of about as much diplomacy as an alarm clock certainly not he answered he had not hesitated he had looked straight into my eyes but i knew that he believed that he had lied see here i said i take it that one five thousand dollars is as good to you as another if you know who committed the murder and will produce him i ll give you the five thousand dollars myself don t say that mary danny stepped out from behind the long curtains at the end of the south windows canneziano jumped like a spurred bronco spying eh my lady she spoke directly to me listen mary don t ever for any reason enter into any sort of an agreement with this man if he knows or thinks that he knows who the murderer is he can be forced to tell without a bribe if he had known for one day one hour and had withheld the information he is in effect an accomplice there is a legal term for it but i have forgotten it i am going out now to find uncle sam and to bring him here and tell him that this man says that he knows who committed the murder mary you telephone to the sheriff in telko just a moment please canneziano spoke smoothly and smilingly i have said definitely that i do not know who killed the gaby and i do not know i am bored unspeakably bored i should like to try my hand at detecting this er villain but he shrugged his narrow shoulders with no impetus the fact that she was your own daughter i began hotly don t mary danny interrupted with a sigh there is no use you and he do not speak the same language how is this canneziano said and went on speaking very rapidly in some foreign language danny stood and stared at him without a mite of expression on her face he paused for breath she said i have forgotten my italian i do not understand you and i am glad that i do not come mary shall we go upstairs in the upper hall she said that she wanted me to go with her to miss macdonald because she wanted to tell miss macdonald what had just happened we knocked on her door she greeted us pleasantly enough but there was a pucker between her eyebrows you have asked us danny began at once to tell you nothing about the case does that mean that you do not wish to have us tell you of day by day developments which seem to have a direct bearing on the case as for instance miss macdonald questioned danny told her about what had happened from the time she had stepped behind the curtains until she and i had come upstairs together miss macdonald s first question was why were you watching him because danny answered straight i think he came here with some evil purpose i should like to find out what that purpose is why were you so eager to prevent mrs magin s making a pact with him miss macdonald a woman who has dealt with criminals as you must have should not need to ask that question but miss macdonald persisted you have not dealt with criminals i have dealt with this man i know that he is bad and crafty for five thousand dollars he would perjure himself over and over again he would produce witnesses who would perjure themselves you know the ways of criminals better than i do miss macdonald i know as uncle sam knows that it is unsafe to deal with them has this man approached you with offers similar to this one miss canneziano he has had no opportunity you are sure of that danny s chin went up a trifle i don t understand i think that you do danny turned to me mary she said yesterday afternoon that man came to my room when i was alone he slipped in closed my door and locked it i ran into gaby s room but i could not get out of it because the doors were all locked i went into gaby s bathroom and locked myself in i stayed there for half an hour or longer until he left miss macdonald evidently thinks that he and i were in conversation during that time i have no proof that we weren t do you believe me mary i do with all my heart i said miss macdonald persisted you told no one about this i did not dare to tell if john thought that that man she stopped short yes questioned miss macdonald i mean that john would fight with him would whip him within an inch of his life why should you care danny looked at me she d care i said answering the appeal in her big hurt eyes because she is a woman miss macdonald it may be hard for you to understand but women who aren t crime analysts don t want their men fighting thank you mary danny said and walked hurriedly out of the room chapter xlvii an aid mrs magin miss macdonald began right off the minute the door had closed behind danny i want to ask you to help me with this case i couldn t be any help to you i said i guess i was rather tart about it why not one reason is i said that anybody who doesn t know any better than to suspicion danny in this affair would need a lot more help to get anywhere than i could give them my only suspicion concerning miss canneziano she answered is that she knows more than she is willing to tell i may be wrong about that have you any other reason for refusing to help me only that you don t believe a word i say if you would consider that i am anyway trying to be honest and if you d do the same with the others until you are sure that you have reason to do otherwise i d consider it an honor to help you and i d thank you kindly i am afraid that i don t entirely understand crime and wickedness i told her aren t the general rules of the world if they were all the good people would have to be locked up for safety s sake while the criminals ran loose for lack of space to confine them why instead of doubting my simple word this morning when i told you how sam always lighted a fire for any excuse couldn t you have believed that i was telling the truth and that whoever put the key in there knew that sam would light the fire and so throw suspicion on himself that is possible she admitted but the key there leads me to suppose that whoever put it there to hide it would be too stupid for much subtle reasoning keys you know don t burn they don t i agreed but we never take the ashes out of the fireplace as you did this morning we open the ash dump and shoot them down into a barrel in the basement every few months the ashes are emptied in starvation field eight miles or more away from here not a bad way to get the key carried off the place if that was what he wanted not a bad way either to throw more suspicion on sam if the key was found most criminals are stupid though she clung to her point try as they may they always make some stupid blunder it seems to me i said that the ones who get caught are stupid they are the ones who have made the blunder left the clue but look at the number of criminals who get clean away not long ago i was reading some statistics you know what mark twain said about statistics there are three kinds of liars liars damned liars and statistics i had to laugh i think she said that to put me in a good humor for she went right on to say but you haven t told me yet that you will be my assistant in this case she couldn t hoodwink me i told you that i d be no use to you as long as you doubted every word i said but she argued by your own admission you tried to shield mr stanley immediately after the murder stopping to clean away his the pipe ashes if you tried once to shield him wouldn t you try again to shield him if you needed to no i said i wouldn t i ll tell you why that night and for several days after my mind was like a dirty cluttered kitchen i couldn t get enough space cleared in it to start thinking let alone working at it i have tidied up a place since then and i ve done a batch of thinking i know now that sam doesn t need me nor anyone to shield him any evidence found against him will be good evidence in the end against whoever fixed it to throw blame on him i am inclined to agree with you she said now then is there anyone here who would benefit by his conviction am i i questioned your assistant or am i not does it make a difference in your answer she questioned in return a deal of difference being your assistant honor would bind me wouldn t it if i know that you are believing that i ll help and tell the truth i ll try to if i think i am to be doubted anyway maybe i ll say what i d like to say she sat and looked straight at me for at least half a minute i do believe you she said and trust you i have since i first met you at the station i can t help myself you re all right mrs magin and i know it i ll agree to your terms now then as my assistant is there anyone on the place who would benefit in any way by mr stanley s conviction in a way i said though it all but choked me john would he is to inherit everything sam has but john loves sam and john didn t do it miss canneziano would also benefit then wouldn t she since she is to marry young mr stanley it doesn t make sense i said john has plenty of his own right now and sam would give them anything and everything they wanted besides as long as he lived i had understood she said that mr stanley objected to the marriage not a bit of it he has asked them to wait a year that s all is there she asked next any person at present on the ranch whom you would concede might possibly commit a murder canneziano yes i know and leaving him out of it well i had to hesitate i am not sure every instinct i have tells me that neither hubert hand nor mrs ricker no it is an awful thing to say but do you know gabrielle canneziano herself was the only other person who has ever been on this ranch whom i could even imagine doing such a terrible thing i wonder why you disliked her so much she said because she didn t have any of the decent ordinary virtues i answered she didn t know anything about them not charity nor gratitude nor kindness nor honesty nor modesty nor nor anything isn t it strange that twin sisters who looked as much alike as these girls did should be so entirely different as to character i had not seen her notes at that time i did not know that she had written innocent after danny s name i spoke up pretty hotly strange or not it is true in character those two girls were as different as night and day i never even thought that they looked alike who told you that they did i have seen their photographs she reminded me chadwick caufield s album is filled with them their photographs may look alike they didn t but they did she insisted i tell you i said that they acted so differently and talked so differently and dressed so differently that there was not one bit of likeness a most unusual state of affairs for duplicate twins these sunshine and tempest relationships are seldom found outside a mary j holmes novel miss danielle canneziano came here on a most doubtful errand an errand that amounted to robbery nothing else if you are accusing danny i interrupted oh i am not there was a flash of temper in that making all allowances for mistakes in time miss canneziano could not have committed the murder herself but suppose that her past was not as innocent and blameless as she would like to have you all think suppose that a revelation of all she knows or suspects concerning her sister s death would also bring to light things that she can not afford to have brought to light concerning herself it is at least reasonable to think that she knows more than she is willing to tell maybe i had to admit but i doubt it why do you so dislike that admission because john loves her john is a good boy i d hate to see his heart broken will you forgive me for saying that young mr stanley does not impress me as a man who is very deeply in love i know i agreed just now he is a mite put out with danny he has been ever since she accused sam considering the circumstances under which miss canneziano made that accusation young mr stanley is acting most unjustly if that is the case all men are unjust to the women they love i told her it seems to be a part of it like a rash with measles she smiled at that and changed the subject i wonder whether you noticed she said that coming up from the station i set a trap for miss canneziano just for an instant i fancied that there was more fear than grief in her attitude toward meeting her father i suggested you remember that she see him alone i wanted to see whether she desired a private interview with him her prompt refusal made it evident that she had no secret to give to him and expected to get none from him that is in her favor still before you go now since you have agreed to help me do you mind if i direct a bit i want you to keep one eye on miss canneziano i want you to keep the other eye on mr canneziano mr hand and mrs ricker will you do that one whole eye for danny i questioned and only a third of an eye for each of the others for the present she smiled will you do that i said that i would it was not until after dinner the next day when i was resting in my own room feeling as virtuous as the three monkeys who see no evil hear no evil speak no evil pleased as punch over my failures of the past twenty four hours that i realized that i just naturally could not carry through a job that went as much against the grain as that job went we are i thought allowed to know some things just simple honest knowing and i knew that keeping a suspicious eye on the girl who had said bless your heart to me on the evening of the second of july was as sensible as sitting up for santa claus someone knocked on my door i answered the knock miss macdonald all smiles was standing there let me come in she said and as soon as my door was closed behind her a most fortunate thing has happened chapter xlviii new clues someone she went on has been to my desk and has stolen the code letter i could manage nothing but an echo fortunate i said i had a careful copy of it locked up of course i have been leaving the letter in plain sight on my desk for bait don t you see mary she forgot her formality in her excitement this is the mistake i have been hoping for i have found a beginning at last it is bound to be easy from now on oh joy she was almost doing dance steps i wasn t i was thinking hard in the tidy space in my mind trying not to get it cluttered with her excitement trying to cook up some common sense the letter she went on could not have concerned anyone in this house except miss canneziano her father and possibly not probably young mr stanley i guess i said that was likely what you were wanted to think her gray eyes questioned me supposing i answered that mrs ricker or hubert hand or anyone of us wanted to get you clear off the track suspecting especially danny could one of us do better than to steal the code letter my word she said and you with a mind that works like that spending your life doing cooking doing cooking i told her is how my mind comes to work like that if anyone ever told you that it didn t take brains to cook he was making a big mistake but such quick sure thinking she said is marvelous she laughed listen to me doing a dr watson for your holmes she said golly but i m lucky to have you at hand though i love to be flattered i sat and preened myself all the same she went on it does prove one thing that the murderer or his close accomplice is right here on the place now chad s confession proved that the key in the fireplace proved it too dear me no not conclusively now let me see she took a folded paper from the front of her dress here is my copy of the letter it does look a mess doesn t it i looked at the paper and read as before paexzazlytp f y nyx ogrgrsgo rn fgao atf jan j asn ahzgo zkg c ahhalo vkgt nyx clplzgf rg lt zkg kypulzae zkaz nyx it surely looked a mess the fact that it was written on the typewriter she said makes me suspect that the typewriter may unwrite it for us i told her then what i had not thought to tell her before about my having heard the typewriter going slowly in gaby s room right after she had received the letter fine she said she had burned the caps for the keys too all but the curly q that rolled away may i use the same typewriter that she used we went together into gaby s room i should have thought you d want to clean this room first of all i said mr stanley unlocked it for me that first night i spent five or six very busy hours in here and i slept here that night too upon my soul doesn t that go to show i d have taken oath in any court that you spent the night in your own room that is exactly it she said honest people are so sure that they know things which they don t know at all and that they have seen things which they haven t seen i have wished since that i had said something else instead of saying well i might think i knew something which i didn t know but i d never make a mistake about what i had seen or had not seen perhaps not she said did you find anything in here that night i questioned nothing the burned papers were completely burned as they usually are of course the complete absence of clues should be made into a valuable clue but i haven t quite worked it out for instance though you insist that she was a vain conceited person if ever there was one vain women usually have photographs of themselves about i found not one in here she used to have one in a silver frame i said i looked around and saw the frame lying face down on the mantel i picked it up an old faded picture of sam and margarita in their wedding togs confronted me i had seen it plenty of times before but in the old album downstairs when i had shown it to miss macdonald and had told her about it she took it and carried it to the window the glass has been washed carefully she said since the picture was put in here she pressed on the purple velvet back and took the picture from the frame across the bottom of the picture where the wide silver frame had hidden it written in gaby s bold handwriting were these words my one deadly enemy my word said miss macdonald are you certain she questioned next that the girl s mother is not living don t ask me to be certain of anything i said and looked for a chair to sit down in she came and put one of her capable hands on my shoulders you shouldn t let this trouble you she said it is more than likely that gabrielle canneziano had nothing to do with it i must verify the handwriting in the next instant she certainly gave me a fine turn her eyes went big and round her cheeks blazed with blushes and she clapped her hands to them and stood staring at me as if i were the original human horror i she gasped out i have made a mistake i felt like rising and giving her a good shaking lands i snapped who hasn t i would discharge one of my assistants like that she snapped her fingers for such a mistake crime analyst confounded ass conceited amateur oh she went running out of the room leaving me sitting there to do what i liked with that talk of hers she was back in two minutes she had gaby s last note to danny in her hands i have been assuming she said and her cheeks flamed up again that gabrielle canneziano wrote this note i have had a pleasant little assumption now i will get some facts i must find a sample of her handwriting she began to search through gaby s desk i helped her gaby had made a thorough job of her burning there was not a scratch of her writing to be found danny will have something i said i ll see whether she is in her room danny was in her room sitting at her own desk writing out checks and addressing envelopes i told her i had come to ask her for a sample of gaby s handwriting i am sorry mary she said as she finished addressing an envelope sealed it and looked for a stamp in the stamp box but i haven t anything except of course the last note she wrote to me and miss macdonald is keeping that please dear i urged won t you search through your desk and your papers it is really very important but i have looked mary mrs ricker had the same idea yesterday she thought that gaby might not have written that last note i am certain that she did but i searched and searched to satisfy mrs ricker i destroyed gaby s letters to me when we came to the united states she has had no reason for writing anything to me since then hubert hand had several notes from her but he says he has not kept them she addressed another envelope and added it to the pile beside her it isn t she said noticing my reluctance to leave that i am not interested mary it is only that i know that i haven t a scrap of her writing i turned to go i had reached the door when she called to me and asked me to take her letters downstairs for the mailbag when i went downstairs i returned to miss macdonald with my information dear me she said mrs ricker indeed if only they would work with me mary instead of by themselves or against me at any rate she put aside the photograph a ruler like thing and her magnifying glass the note to danielle canneziano and the writing on the photograph were done by the same person what are the letters you have there in your hand mrs magin i told her they were some that danny had asked me to take downstairs she held out her hand for them i had to allow her to have them but first i read the addresses they were the names of mail order stores in portland oregon and in san francisco california miss macdonald looked at them closely then she took up a flat paper knife from gaby s desk and deliberately opened the envelope by lifting the flap she surely does not seal her letters carefully she said and took out a check nothing else from the envelope it is dated to day the thirteenth of july she said of course it is i answered tartly not liking any of this she was writing them just now while i was in there did you see her writing them she asked i certainly did she sighed and moved her head with an impatient gesture rather like john s worried gestures then that is that she said and returned the check to the envelope sealed the envelope and gave it with the others back to me now for the code letter she said and sat down in front of the typewriter i left her there and went to look for sam chapter xlix new suspicions i found him in the living room playing solitaire mrs ricker was in the chair by the window tatting lands sam i said sitting down across the table from him when did you take to sitting around and wasting good time like this i am helping miss macdonald he said making it easy for her to watch me and convincing her that i m more or less of a nut at the same time two birds with one stone she isn t watching you mrs ricker spoke up she is watching hubert and me queer that with all the years i had known mrs ricker as a dumb person now that she had begun to talk her talking seemed only natural i reckon sam said that she is watching all of us pretty closely no mrs ricker insisted she is watching hubert and me chiefly me i can t stand it much longer i am losing my mind if i don t leave here before long i shall be quite insane i can t say that sam s ears actually pricked up when she said that but they gave that impression i didn t know that you were thinking about leaving here mrs ricker he said i am thinking about it because if i don t leave here soon i shall have to be taken to an insane asylum now now mrs ricker sam urged don t be feeling like that it is just a case of watch and let watch around here now it certainly is not a case of live and let live she said i tell you i can t stand it she jumped up from her chair and went rushing out of the room through the front door on the porch she dropped into a chair and hid her face in her hands as i looked at her sitting there i remembered that it was she who had found the body her story had sounded straight enough but before she had told it she had had plenty of time to make it a straight one perhaps she had had help in making it a straight one hubert hand he had by his own admission served a term in prison for forgery he had had notes from gaby and had destroyed them was it possible that he might have written the farewell note to gaby and the inscription on the photograph sam could not swear that hubert hand had been in the barn the entire hour between five and six o clock that meant then that no one knew positively where he had been between five and six o clock i remembered how eager he had been at first to prove that john was the guilty person how readily he had accepted the theory of martha s guilt that theory had been mrs ricker s mrs ricker loved hubert hand she had loved martha too but martha was dead would it have been possible for hubert hand to have slipped into the house through the front door during that hour between five and six without danny s having seen him possible that was all danny had cut the bread in the kitchen she had emptied jelly from its glass to a dish had cut the butter each task a matter of minutes but coming through the front door and getting upstairs would be a matter of minutes also mrs ricker of course would have seen hubert hand pass through the room but mrs ricker could keep a secret again what had he thought that i had overheard that day in the cabin what motive could he have had for killing gaby suppose that gaby had lied to danny about the entire contents of the code letter and that after all the money had been hidden on the place that would be an explanation for canneziano s coming to the ranch but suppose that hubert hand had found it or had known that gaby had found it come home mary sam s voice speaking extra low cut in on my reverie i want to know what you think about this i set canneziano to mending the south clover fence this morning i told him i was going to north clover on my way there i passed the house i happened to remember how slick miss macdonald had cleaned the attic it seemed a shame not to use it so i went up taking my field glasses with me for luck i d watched about five minutes out of the window when i saw canneziano leave the fence and make up toward the cabin i came down jumped on bobbie burns and circled around the hill back of the cabin just as i got my glasses trained i saw danny walking to beat time coming away from the cabin i don t know whether she had been in it or not i didn t see her come out of it i rode straight down before i had quite reached the cabin canneziano came out of it he was carrying a fishing rod and he went right down to the stream with it what i m wondering is had he and danny met at the cabin and had a talk i know exactly what mrs ricker means i said about losing her mind on this place it has come to the pass that no one can do any simple thing without being spied on and suspected danny always takes her walks in the direction of the cabin we all do it is the prettiest coolest walk on the place does she always walk so fast trying to keep cool probably not i said unless she has seen canneziano and is walking fast trying to get away from him sam rubbed the back of his head by joe i hadn t thought of that think about it now for a minute i advised when you get through try to think whether you know of any place where we could get hold of a scrap or two of gaby s handwriting we have the last note she wrote to danny but we want something more you ve come to the right place for once he said and took a long envelope out of his pocket i guess i never happened to mention to you did i that i fixed up a small checking account for the girls in the telko bank it was just a matter of my own convenience saved me the pesky trouble of buying money orders at the postoffice their bank statements and canceled checks came in a few days ago i was going to look them over soon as i could get around to it here they are do you want me to take them up to miss macdonald i ll take them i offered and save you the trip i longed to see how much of sam s money the girls had spent in one month and what they had spent it for i don t know yet whether it was cunning contrariness or courtesy that propelled sam up those stairs with the envelope tight in his hand and without having allowed me as much as a peek at its contents chapter l shovels i went into the kitchen and put through a fairly good batch of baking considering that i d got a late start at it i had intended only to stir up a sunshine cake for supper but when a thunder shower came washing everything cool and sweet i opened the kitchen wide to it and made an angel cake out of the whites of the eggs and baked a big pan of ginger bread zinnia did the washing up so i was all through and frosting the cakes when miss macdonald telephoned down to the kitchen and asked me to go for a walk with her between times i d roasted three chickens and got a salad in the icebox i wouldn t need to turn a hand to supper for an hour so i told her that i d like nothing better than a breath of the clean sage seasoned air and that i d be ready in ten minutes i gave zinnia a few directions and went upstairs to change my shoes as i came down the front stairs into the living room i saw mrs ricker coming up the steps to the porch she was toting a big old shovel carrying it out in front of her and carefully right side up like it was a pancake turner and she had a pancake on it i stopped in my tracks there are some connections that the mind refuses president coolidge with a six gun for instance or chief justice taft with a saxophone or mrs ricker with a heavy dirty old shovel she stopped to turn sidewise and open the screen door with her foot and then she came straight along into the living room poking the thing toward miss macdonald i want you to look at this she said miss macdonald all crisp in white linen backed away a mite but she looked as directed i came hurrying to look too i don t know what i expected to see nothing less than a dead scorpion but certainly something more than i did see an old iron shovel with dirt on it well miss macdonald questioned i was going to martha s grave when the shower came up i stopped in the cabin this shovel and another one were inside the door there look at that earth it is fresh earth now i tell you two people have been digging around this place and they were at it not longer ago than yesterday more likely this morning my word said miss macdonald it seemed to me there was more annoyance in her voice than there was interest or astonishment somebody i pronounced still believes that there is money hidden around here mrs ricker nodded her satisfaction but surely miss macdonald said around a farm a ranch that is around a place of this sort there must be a great deal of digging going on gardens vegetables you know that is one thing and another she fumbled it like that we don t make garden here in july i told her the vegetable gardens and greenhouses are about three miles away from where mrs ricker found the shovels to be sure she puckered her brows but mr stanley spoke of fishing don t the men dig worms for bait anyone i told her who did bait fishing on the desert moon would be about as popular as an s p c a convention at a round up likely you ll learn our ways in time bait fishing isn t one of them while i had been getting this off my mind danny had come downstairs i guess we must have looked funny the three of us standing there and staring at the shovel which mrs ricker was still holding as if it were a pancake turner but what is it danny inquired it is a shovel said mrs ricker yes i know but what about it it has fresh earth on it mrs ricker explained it means that someone is still hunting for something on this ranch i don t understand danny faltered you do if anyone does mrs ricker said trying to make it sound off handish but it did not to my surprise miss macdonald answered i think that you are mistaken mrs ricker miss canneziano knows i fancy no more about the shovel than you do mrs ricker s face flushed she carried the thing out and threw it into the yard with a gesture of furious anger when miss macdonald and i passed her on the porch she turned her head away and did not look at us if we hurry i said we ll have time to walk to the cabin and see the other shovel bother the other shovel we don t want to hurry can t we get down to the stream somewhere close here and find a place where we can be alone to talk right down this path i answered and started down it she followed me for fifty yards or more neither of us said a word i was too put about to feel like talking why should she have told me to bother the shovel why had she acted so peculiarly about the shovels anyway choosing to assume that they were unimportant if as i supposed she was thinking mrs ricker had gone to the trouble to fix up those two shovels and to carry one of them in to hoodwink us that was important i was sure in my own mind that ollie ricker had not done that if she had not and if two people were digging around the place they were digging for something weren t they for what for exactly what i had said for money worms i must have made a sound that was suggestive of my disgusted annoyance for miss macdonald stepped up to walk beside me on the narrow path i am sorry she said that i have seemed so exasperatingly stupid but i know that those shovels are of no importance i don t see how you could know that i said i am sorry again but i have promised not to tell you how i know it not to tell me i meant of course that i had promised not to tell anyone my promise was made to mr stanley since this has come up i am sure that he will allow me to break it and tell you later what it is that i can t tell you now sam i said i was mad all over i had thought that anyway sam was open and above board with me you ll understand all about it later she said please don t be vexed i have some really good news first the handwriting on the checks the photograph and the note all tally accurately that must mean that gabrielle canneziano wrote all of them next i have worked out the key to the code letter lands alive i said my astonishment and admiration getting the best of my bad humor in this short time talk about wonders not a bit of it the code is so simple that i am surprised that people who have wits enough to use a code at all would use it the keys on typewriters with a standard keyboard are arranged you know for the touch system of writing a s d f g so on all that this code amounts to is taking the letters straight as they come along a b c d and so on from the center line of letters they skip to the upper line making the q be a j and from the upper line down to the lower line making the z a t they use only the letters on the keyboard and the punctuation marks as they would rightly be used generally they put a hyphen after the letter to be capitalized though occasionally they use the capital letter it is so childish that i fancy it is only a friendship code and that it is not used for matters of any real importance then this letter is of no importance i asked not to the writer of vast importance to us i believe it explains why the original letter was stolen among other things here is one of the copies that i made of it chapter li danielle s secret we had come to the stream and to the shade of the aspen trees i sat down on one of the rocks above the first fishing hole and unfolded the papers she had given to me and read salutations do you remember my dear and gay gaby after the v affair when you visited me in the hospital that you said with your imitated mona lisa smile sorry old dear i made a trifling mistake did i not the incident has probably passed from your memory it has not passed from mine because i did not believe then and i do not believe now that you intended to fire that shot at v instead of at me you proved your innocence however like the expert you are so let the dead past et cetera particularly since i did not die but have lived to make also a trifling mistake i find that i was in error concerning the train robbery after due reflection i have remembered that reading of the details in the denver papers your respected father and i merely regretted that we had not had the forethought and the cleverness to have pulled the affair ourselves since this is the case we could not have hidden the money as i seem to recall telling you that we did on the desert moon ranch it was a pretty dream of ours that was all shall i explain do you remember the sweet cocotte with the colored sash at cannes very young very exquisite and almost very innocent she watched us from her table out of the violet corners of her long long eyes when we left the place you and i my gloves were missing and i returned for them you were duped my dear were you not she is not as lovely not as gay as you were at eighteen but you are no longer eighteen and you have grown exacting and a bit vicious recalling again the v affair and a bit selfish too i knew that you collected the final five hundred pounds from baron t these and all things considered i seem to myself to have acted rather nobly rather compassionately i spared you the heartache of witnessing your supplantation ours was a tender leave taking was it not i paid the expenses of a long and costly journey for you and the gentle danielle gad gaby i d have paid twice as much to be rid of you for half the time i sent you to fond relatives i provided you with an interesting and romantic occupation treasure hunting i gave the righteous danielle the opportunity for which she was pining the opportunity to try her hand at turning you into an honest woman tell her by the way that her lover or as she virtuously insisted her husband is still with me and that he is behaving himself admirably i suspect that my lili is a bit over fond of him but i have warned her that one who has had the chaste affections of the little nun would be unlikely to succumb to her ardencies lili now inquires to whom am i writing she is eighteen she has seen you so i dare tell her to you in a far country with an amusing name nevada she mispronounces it deliciously she blows it and you charmingly away from the tips of her tiny pink fingers she kisses my ears she tells me that she owns me so i suppose i should not sign myself as of old yours with an ever increasing devotion bimbi good lands alive i said my stomach hurt me and my head ached i am sorry for young mr stanley miss macdonald said but you see i was right in thinking that miss canneziano s life might hold a secret no no danny stood there in front of us holding to an aspen tree for support i wondered whether you were coming out from behind the tree miss macdonald said i saw you looking at me you are cruel you are very cruel for a minute all i could be was sorry for danny i got up and went to her and put an arm around her she tucked her head down on my breast she was so small that i could look right over it at miss macdonald sitting there undisturbed and triumphant she was in the right and was a good girl so it was queer that the sight of her made my heart go straight out to the wrong bad little danny with her brown head underneath my chin danny honey i said are you planning a divorce after you ve had your six months in nevada was he cruel to you unfaithful no no she said nothing like that nothing at all i can explain every word of it but will anyone believe me you just try it i urged i m all set for believing you right here and now come over here and rest and tell us all about it i led her across to the rock where i had been sitting and made a place for her beside me chapter lii an explanation she began right straight forward and sensible i knew that was in the letter and i longed to destroy it on that account but i was afraid i knew that its disappearance would throw all sorts of suspicions on me but this morning when i saw the thing right there on her desk the temptation was too great i never thought of her having made a copy of it this afternoon when i heard her at the typewriter i knew i ve been in torment ever since i have prayed and prayed that she might fail to work out the code when i came downstairs just now i knew that she had not failed i thought she would tell you about it so i followed i thought perhaps if i d tell you both the truth and plead with you to believe me but now i am ashamed to offer it you won t believe me john won t believe me but it was only a doll one of those funny long legged floppy things with an adorable face i saw him in paris and loved him and bought him for mine i called him christopher clover and said that he was my husband because i had always said that i would never marry lewis he was so horrid about everything used to tease me about my lover until i got so tired of it and so ashamed that i put him away on a closet shelf after we were all packed and the trunks were locked that last day i found him there on the shelf gaby wanted me to carry him on my arm that was done quite a bit over there she thought it was chic but i thought it looked silly i was going to leave him in the apartment but lewis asked me to let him have him i did that is all but will you let me see the copy of the letter gaby read it to me only once i gave it to her see she said eagerly he calls me righteous see how he speaks of the doll and his lili he wouldn t have spoken like that about a man nor said that he was behaving himself see too he calls me a nun if you ll be fair it seems to me you can easily believe me honey child i said and spoke the truth i do believe you it is sensible and reasonable i believe every word you ve told us and you she appealed to miss macdonald your explanation is reasonable you have told the truth about everything else in the letter certainly i shall give you the benefit of the doubt you won t tell john danny pleaded of course not nor anyone else just now shall we go back to the house danny and i sat still i ll run along then she said and went away without us danny i began at once you take my advice you get to john as quickly as you can and tell him the truth about this he loves you he ll want to believe you men always believe whatever they want to believe don t you worry another mite about it have you noticed she questioned slowly that john has been different very different ever since we ve all been different dear i told her yes i know but john has been more different mary tell me am i silly have you noticed that john seems to be very much interested in this miss macdonald he looks at her all the time and he jumps about waiting on her rather as chad used to do with gaby of course he feels that i have changed too and i have i can t keep from showing how unhappy i am and how worried i suppose i constantly disappoint him and yet danny i said it is just this men don t wear well in times of trouble they can t help it it is the way they are mixed so we women put up with it we have to if we put up with men at all everything is going to come out all right but i want you to tell john yourself about your doll and not wait for someone else to do it i ll try to she agreed but we are so rarely alone together any more on our way back to the house sam and john overtook us i got sam to walk along fast with me and left them lagging behind us i m a mite worried sam said about those two young folks i don t quite make them out here lately i suggested to john a while ago that considering danny s trouble and all it might be just as well for them to have an early wedding told him to talk it over with danny and that any date they set would be all right with me i was all braced against being carried off and drowned in a torrent of gratitude no siree that young whelp evaded it said that he d see and that she d say that right after so much trouble might not be a suitable time for a wedding i d give a pretty to know what he has on his mind i can t think that the boy is just rotten fickle and yet he has been shining up to miss macdonald here of late have you noticed it mary noticed nothing was the best that i could do chapter liii another murder canneziano did not come down for breakfast the following morning i thought that a little strange for meals were the one thing he had been real polite to ever since he had been on the desert moon as soon as breakfast was over miss macdonald spoke to sam and asked him as she had asked him that first morning if she might detain him you also mrs magin she smiled at me i wonder she said as soon as we three were alone together if mr canneziano could have given us the slip last night not likely with ten of the boys all drawing wages for watching the place and him in particular is it sam questioned not at all likely still will you go and see whether or not he is in his room now mr stanley sam went when he came back he had to drawl a lot more than usual to keep his voice steady his door is locked he doesn t answer when i pound on it miss macdonald said i have an excellent pass key let s go up and try it curiosity dragged me along with her and sam though every bone in my body protested miss macdonald s key unlocked the door the three of us went into the room the blinds were tightly drawn the electric fan was whirring and buzzing away in the gray gloom miss macdonald crossed the room quickly and snapped up the blinds there was one long hard dusty shaft of yellow sunlight sam walked through it to the bed where canneziano was lying huddled up under the covers i looked the other way i heard the rattle of sam s pipe as it fell on the floor i heard the rustle of miss macdonald s quick movement i heard a queer throaty note that she uttered something dragged my hot aching eyes open i looked toward the bed i saw canneziano s swollen discolored face i saw the deep yellow throat with great brutal bruises at its base the shaft of sunlight moved up and down up and down carving through the swaying blackness like a long sharp knife i felt sam s strong hands on my shoulders pressing me down into a chair i heard myself saying shrilly over and over what are we going to do what are we going to do it was miss macdonald s voice cold and clear as spring water that brought me to my senses we are going to find the murderer on the desert moon ranch sam said you re damn right we are and we are going to have half a dozen he men detectives on this place by to morrow night very well miss macdonald answered will you telephone at once for the coroner mr stanley hell sam said i had my face covered but there was a hollowness in that oath of sam s that told me plainer than any looking at him could have told me that he was frightened scared to the marrow of his bones it took miss macdonald though to understand the reason for his fear yes mr stanley she said these men when they come this time in spite of their friendship for you are not going to be as easily satisfied as they were last time they were able to blink at one murder they can t keep on blinking they dare not even in nevada who wants them to blink sam bluffed you do we all do for the present sam did not answer that he stood and looked stupid won t you listen to reason she urged before you go downstairs to telegraph for other detectives in talking to you this way i am putting all of my pride behind me and i am violating my own code of professional ethics so i want to say first that if you will allow me to remain on this case i ll take not one cent in payment wait let me have my say out and then you may have yours my motives are not entirely unselfish motives seldom are for one thing i have never been dismissed from a case it is a humiliation i would pay any price to avoid i have other reasons but no matter that is my side of it your side of it is this if when the coroner and the others arrive to day you confess that no progress has been made they will undoubtedly step in and take matters into their own bungling hands i think that they would make an arrest that would be fatal now for i am positive that they would arrest an innocent person and that the guilty person would then have an excellent opportunity for escape i have a certain reputation mr stanley and these men particularly the sheriff respect it if you will keep me on this case i will tell them that i am making definite progress that i believe i shall be able to turn the criminal over to the state within a comparatively short time would that be the truth sam demanded she hesitated if you mean is that what i believe now my answer is yes i may be wrong i have at least a very definite suspicion i have no proofs you wouldn t sam questioned give these men that assurance if you knew that i was going to get some men detectives up here to work with you i couldn t she said i can speak only for myself i do not can not work with detectives not of my own choosing i would give any one you brought here my notes the definite results of my investigations so far i would have no right now to give him anything else in other words sam said you don t care a whoop about having the murderer discovered unless you can do the discovering yourself and get the credit for it sam stanley i said her cheeks flamed please get your other detectives here as soon as possible if you wish them to consult with me before i leave for san francisco john s voice came calling down the hall dad are you up here wait miss macdonald commanded tell him to wait a moment sam opened the door a crack i ll be with you in a minute son he closed the door and stood looking questions at miss macdonald she walked quickly across the room and stopped close to sam facing him i m sorry i lost my temper just now i m not going unless you force me to go please don t please give me my chance do you realize what it means to be tried for a murder even if one is acquitted i am not asking this for myself i wouldn t stoop to beg for anything for myself as i am begging for this now i am sure you mean to be a fair man be fair to me and to all of the innocent people here on your ranch i don t say that other detectives might not be able to discover the murderer i do say that i am certain they would do irreparable harm before they succeeded if you stayed sam had the cheek to question and worked along with them that was my idea couldn t you prevent their doing any harm i could try to i will try to if you insist but i am doubtful of my success consciously or unconsciously they work against me because i am a woman you don t know them as i do you don t know their methods as i do if you feel that you must have others here working on the case allow me to send at my own expense for my own assistants the girls whom i have trained we don t need any more girls around here sam said it is pretty certain that we do need someone to protect the lives of all of us on this place when you telephone for the coroner she said won t you telephone for a locksmith to come out with him and bring strong bolts for all the doors you admit then that we are all in danger nothing of the sort you are all perfectly safe at present i do believe that before long my own life may be in danger i want no one to think that i suspect that i need the protection of the bolts it must seem that i think that everyone needs the protection you believe sam questioned that your own life is in danger and yet please re consider mr stanley please allow me to have the case alone at any rate for a little while longer game sam had muttered it to himself but i had heard it i knew that she had won for the present at any rate you honestly think he questioned that you can manage this single handed and keep us all safe and produce this murderer pretty shortly i do mr stanley and you honestly think that other detectives coming here now might make a peck of trouble arrest the wrong person and mess things up generally i have never been more certain of anything i think the fact that you dismissed me now and sent for others would be damning evidence against innocence to the men from telko let me meet them in my professional capacity to day mr stanley let me meet them not as a failure but as a person confident of success i know that i can manage them and send them away satisfied mary can t you say something won t you help me to persuade mr stanley you don t need any help i told her he s persuaded is that true mr stanley may i have the case alone for a little while longer she was all breathless with eagerness drat it all yes sam said i m damned if i know what i ought to do but you are dead game i well shake on it miss macdonald you ll do the best you can for us i know that the hand she held out to him was trembling and her voice as she thanked him trembled but still i was amazed when right after sam had gone out of the room she said to me mary i believe on my soul that i have just had an experience that is too strong for me and hid her face in the crook of her arm and began to cry chapter liv delay i myself heard the sheriff say to sam late in the afternoon of the day we had found canneziano strangled in his bed i tell you what sam this is a pretty dirty business all of it if you had anyone but lynn macdonald on the case i reckon it would be up to us boys to step in and take a hand but she has sure given us some pretty good dope and we re waiting she s got the rep there s that dolingfetter movie murder she put that through when all the police force and all the dicks in the country had failed for a year and the van muiter case and a dozen others i know you re square sam all us guys around here know it but i m damn glad you ve got lynn macdonald on the job to prove it to the country as i say i heard that conversation with my own ears and yet in the week that followed i had times of thinking that anyway sam had likely made a mistake in keeping miss macdonald on alone i couldn t begin to describe the horror of that week it is i suppose what books call a paradox to say that the worst thing about the week was that nothing just nothing happened to all outward appearances the desert moon ranch was as peaceful as an empty grave hollow peace false peace and all of us conniving at the falsity made it worse one day for instance when we were all at dinner zinnia dropped the teakettle in the kitchen we women all screamed sam whipped his six gun from his back pocket john rushed to the kitchen he came back wiping the sweat from his forehead zinnia dropped the teakettle it didn t hurt her we all looked foolish and began to be very busy passing things and pretending that our actions had all been the ordinary conservative actions of people who had heard anything heavy dropped sam locked up the house early every evening then trying to make it casual one and another of us would go sauntering around to make sure that he hadn t overlooked a door or a window people were constantly jumping and starting and looking behind them at nothing none of us women ever went far from the house except mrs ricker to visit martha s grave for one thing sam had increased the guard around the place and i never felt sure when i ran down to the dairy that one of the cowpunchers wouldn t think i was trying to escape and take a shot at me for another thing though both murders had been done in the house there was a feeling of safety about four walls that i couldn t get in the open air as i have said mrs ricker went every day to visit martha s grave she went alone i would not have gone with her not for any price i was afraid of her i was afraid of hubert hand by wednesday of that week i was afraid of everyone in the house except miss macdonald and sam friday found me doubtful of sam losing my mind of course i was or it was losing itself in the black shadow of crime by which the desert moon had been eclipsed a mind can t go straight in darkness any more than a body can none of our minds went straight those days i am sure that the mind of each one of us on the place always excepting miss macdonald s did as mine did it went groping in the dark it bumped into obstacles of doubt it tripped over fear and fell into senseless stupidities it lost its way and wandered into wild suspicions i tell you there were times during those frightful days when i found myself seriously considering whether or not i had committed the two murders on thursday evening of that week mrs ricker said to me with no concern at all in her manner i wish i knew just how that lethal chamber that they use for executions in this state felt whether it hurts to be executed that way and how long it takes to die in it and all about it because she went on still unconcernedly if it didn t hurt too much i d much rather confess to the murders and get it over than to keep on living like this i am going insane i think that i can t stand another week like this one every hour now is worse than a quick painless death too i m afraid of what i might do if i go clear mad with all these horrors in my mind though perhaps i have already gone mad do i seem to you to be insane right now mary i told her no but it was a flat lie at that moment i was certain that everyone on the place was more or less insane especially miss macdonald i think yet that i was right about the others i know now that i was wrong about miss macdonald but she had certainly given me plenty of reasons for thinking either that she had lost her senses entirely or else that she had never had any to lose apparently after sam had agreed to keep her on the case she had at once given up all interest in it she had a short talk with me and told me that she would no longer need my help and expressly instructed me to stop watching danny and the others as far as it is humanly possible she said i want you to go about the business of living as if nothing at all unpleasant even had happened i don t want this to be an appearance i want it to be a fact then as if she knew i couldn t follow those fool instructions and as if she were bound to have them followed at any cost she began to follow them herself she got sort of childish about it on tuesday evening she produced a bunch of paper and some pencils when we had all thought that something important was going to happen she suggested that we play that old silly game of consequences and when we one and all had other things to do she was none too pleasant about it said that she was tired of reading every evening and that the radio made her nervous she fussed about until danny feeling as she did got john and hubert hand to make up the four to play bridge all week i could see sam watching her and growing more and more impatient on thursday he said to me that she was too busy flirting with john to have time for anything else that was not fair she didn t flirt with john she wasn t the sort who would flirt with anyone but she surely did begin to notice him and his attentions to her it was not that she treated him too well in any way it was only that she did not treat him quite according to our standards for the way unengaged girls should treat engaged or married men not once did she encourage him to neglect danny but after john had neglected her miss macdonald seemed to be usually right on the spot ready waiting and willing to be pleasant and friendly to him i tried to make excuses for john poor little danny wasn t i had to admit much like the girl he had fallen in love with she had lost practically all of her prettiness and she looked all the time too white and wan and generally dragged out to seem quite wholesome like the rest of us the strain of fear and suspicion was too much for her but she was frailer than any of us so the strain told harder on her she had explained to john about the reference to her and to her doll in the code letter he had taken it all right and had been as she said to me sweet about it and about never doubting her word at all still i sort of thought that a grain of suspicion might still be bothering him and i knew that he had not been quite able to forgive her not for telling of her suspicions concerning sam but for suspecting sam in the first place yes i could make some excuses for john but the process of trying not to blame him personally resulted in my opinions of men in general being forced down several degrees as i may have suggested that took them just about to where the thermometer stops registering on friday morning when sam came zigzagging into my kitchen ordered zinnia out of it his voice all thick and husky and fell down into a chair i did not doubt for a minute that he was dead drunk i knew that he had not touched a drop of liquor for forty years but what men could do men might do and worse mary he said we ve got the report from the frisco chemists chapter lv the third murder miss macdonald had thought it necessary to have martha s body exhumed and sent to san francisco that is what the coroner and the undertaker had been about on their second trip to the ranch sam had not wanted any of us to know about it particularly he had not wanted mrs ricker to know that had suited miss macdonald better too so they had had the men do the work while we were all at dinner that day they had been careful to fix the grave so that it would not show that it had been disturbed and then being men they had left their shovels right there in the cabin for the first person to find as you know the first person had been mrs ricker we had been waiting ever since for the chemist s report sam s looks and actions now kept the question from my lips i thought that the report must have contained some new horror in a way it had but sam s first words were reassuring it is too good to be true he said and repeated dazedly too good to be true miss macdonald had her assistants trace the prescription from doctor roe the powders were harmless i didn t cause my girl s death the report proves miss macdonald says the report proves take it easy sam what does the report prove somebody gave her a deadly poison the chemists found two traces one they can t analyze that s why they ve kept us waiting so long for the report they are still working on it hoping for results the other was nitrobenzene miss macdonald says that in small doses induces coma and takes as long as twenty four hours to act but it is apt not to be deadly by itself it was combined with this other drug the one that must have made death certain miss macdonald came hurrying into the kitchen she was holding the monkey charm bracelet in her hand see here she said this bangle thing opens i think we can be certain that the poison she took or was given came out of it there is a trace of the odor smell it she handed it to me it smelled a little like shoe polish with sort of a faint almond flavoring underneath i gave it to sam who had been reaching out his hand for it he smelled it and then knotted it up in his fist remembering i can t think of anything that he said which would do to quote the gist of it was that if gaby had given martha the poison he was not sorry that gaby had been killed because justice had been done he went on to say that if she had not given it to martha purposely but only carelessly forgetting its deadliness he reckoned that things had turned out for the best as far as gaby was concerned anyway not satisfied with that he expressed violently his regrets that vengeance had been taken out of his hands it isn t vengeance you want mr stanley miss macdonald reminded him pretty sternly but justice that is within our reach i am practically certain that the person who poisoned martha who strangled miss canneziano and her father is right here on this place hold on sam interrupted considering that this person is a poisoner and a strangler and that he is around loose and careless and that we may all be murdered in our beds or out of em or poisoned at our meals it seems to me the next move is to telephone to the sheriff and have him out here in a hurry with some men nothing of the sort miss macdonald snapped at him i have told you before and i tell you again that as matters stand now i am the only person on the ranch who is in the least danger i did not say that i was certain i said that i was practically certain i can t be certain until i have some proof some evidence at present i have not one scrap of either then you can t know who the guilty person is exactly what i have just said my work from now on is to get that proof if you would help me instead of sam interrupted his whole body straining forward with his eagerness tell us who he is and where he is and we ll help you right enough i can t tell you not unless you want to have still another murder on the desert moon ranch but you can help me first by keeping the discovery of the poison a secret second by allowing everyone else on the place to suppose that i am still in a state of entire bafflement concerning the crime third and most important perhaps by having patience with me ye a sam said and while we are sitting around having patience this bird will walk off to some green hill far away i think the boys are doing their best to guard the place but this bird s a slicker what s to keep him from say dressing in my clothes some night and riding merrily away on bobbie burns or wishbone all he d have to do is to give the boys a high sign and they d let him ride to hell if they thought he was me another thing i can t trust all my punchers some of them are greasers some half breeds money and not much of it talks pretty loud to some of those boys at present the person i suspect has no intention of leaving the place when you don t know anything else how can you know that i didn t say that i didn t know anything else do you know and will you tell me why you can t put this fellow where the dogs won t bite him while you are collecting the proof evidence and so on that you think you need for one reason because i am not a police detective sometimes it is necessary to use their methods of arresting each suspect and getting the evidence afterward third degrees so on that method by the way accounts for the number of criminals who are able to make complete escapes it is a stupid bungling method and a brutal one i detest it i have used it only twice in the seven years that i have been in this work i used it then because it was necessary i will not use it now because it is not necessary this case will come to the grand jury complete with indisputable proofs if i had known suspected i mean before mr canneziano was killed what i now suspect she stopped short evidently afraid of saying too much ye a sam argued but nothing has happened since then what i can t get is how you think you are ever going to find the proof the evidence well she began because she finished quite tartly and walked out of the room because sam mimicked almost before she was out of hearing distance it was a black day for me and for the desert moon when i put this thing up to a because woman i more than half agreed with him but i was not going to let him know it did you notice i questioned chiefly to turn his mind from the subject of because women that she kept saying that she thought the person she suspected was on the place i mean she didn t say that he was living in the house house hell of course she didn t say house why should she say house haven t we been over and over it aren t we fair frazzled out every last one of us from climbing up those front and back stairs with our minds all day long and half the night counting minutes counting seconds going to the barn and back over and over nobody who lives in this house could have done it that is settled that is fact not unless some one of us was able to be in two places at the same time between four and five o clock that day something clicked in my mind i declare to goodness i felt the click plain as a twinge of toothache it scared me i put both my hands over the place in the front of my head i felt as dazed and as shaken as if i had been sleep walking and had bumped into a door in the dark and wakened to find myself in a strange brightly lighted room no sir ee sam went on too busy with his own ideas i suppose to notice my actions which must have been peculiar if the murderer is still on the place he is skulking around here in hiding it is that strangler fellow all right i ll bet my last dollar on it for some reason he is trying to clean out the canneziano family all of them i ll bet he told martha to give the poison to danny not knowing what a child martha was or maybe knowing it martha supposing the poison was candy or something nice ate it up herself i tell you what i m going to do some proof hunting now on my own hook if i find some stranger hiding out on this place that will be good enough proof for sam stanley and for any jury in nevada of course mary it hasn t been so hard on you not having to feel the responsibility the way i have but i ve come to the end of my rope i m going to use my own head now i ve got to get an expert here for one thing to watch and guard over danny say what s the matter with you mary you look so funny do you feel sick or something something i said but at that i suppose it isn t near as bad as feeling responsibility if i d stayed there listening to him for one more minute i d have burst i left him and went running like the crazy thing i was up the back stairs to my own room chapter lvi a whisper i stayed in my room for half an hour thinking with all my might that i was thinking at the end of that time discovering that i had not turned out one single rational thought i gave it up and went to find john i forgot all about the men who were guarding the ranch i went straight down to the outfit s quarters i hadn t been on the back of a horse for more than ten years i got a lazy puncher to stop doing nothing long enough to saddle an old nag for me and boost me up on her and off i went jogging along through the clean clear air i at last began really to do some thinking i came to my senses in consequence it was high time i turned the nag around and rode back to the outfit s quarters i slid off of her and left her there and went walking to the house it was fortunate that i had given up my wild goose chase there on the porch sat john talking to miss macdonald when i got close enough to them to see how he looked i felt as if my heart would break for him he looked in spite of his tan like death when i had reached the foot of the steps both of them without saying an aye yes nor no to me got up and went into the house my legs were shaking under me i had to go slowly up the steps neither john nor miss macdonald was in the living room when i got there i went on into the kitchen miss macdonald was putting on her big apron zinnia was clattering the silver in the dining room john knows doesn t he i questioned knows i think that i know what you don t she shot out at me and i wouldn t have jumped any higher if she had shot a gun instead of a word don t she calmed down and came over to me and spoke in a whisper say anything in here not anything i ve got to i said i m human you listen to me i whispered it right into her ear i hadn t half finished what i had to say before she moved away from me but she nodded her head with those quick short little nods that always mean confidential agreement for almost an hour i had been thinking that i knew it that nodding of hers made me realize that i had only feared it that i had believed that she could deny and disprove it i had planned biscuits for dinner i went and got out the bread board and opened the floor bin but i couldn t do it i m sorry i said and to my disgust i began to cry i guess you ll have to make out to do alone for a while i i m not feeling well i ll have to go and lie down still blubbering and blind with tears i went upstairs and bumped into sam standing outside john s door i dried my eyes and saw that he was holding his six gun ready for shooting in his hand chapter lvii grief what is the matter with you i demanded what are you doing with that gun john is in there packing his valise he says he is going to leave the place i say he is not going to say it with the six gun if necessary ugh i asked if necessary mary by god he put it up to me straight he came to me and said that he had to get off the place for a while had to i baited him along asked him where he wanted to go he didn t even try to hide his feelings didn t bother to make up an excuse said it was all the same to him where he went frisco reno salt lake anywhere just so that he could get away when i reckoned he d stay right here he up with the idea of going down to live with the outfit he s a fool so he thinks that i am thinks i don t know he could get a good horse the first night if john thinks you re a fool i said he s paying you too much respect i can t think of anything much worse or more dangerous than a fool but whatever it is you are it it turns me all over to look at you give me that gun i reached out and took it his fingers didn t stick to it very long i judged that he was not quite as eager to shoot john on sight as he had been pretending to be now get yourself away from here i said get on downstairs if you know the way and eat your dinner i ll look after john if you help that boy to escape escape your foot i slipped into john s room shut the door in sam s face and pushed the new bolt into its slot john s things were all strewn about his valise was standing open on a chair but he had stopped trying to pack it he was lying face down on the bed i went and sat on the bed beside him and put an arm around his shoulders mary he questioned yes there there now john dear try to brace up you don t know yes i do know dear i know just what you know my god he groaned it is certain then i still had a little hope i i can t keep on with life not after this when i think of these last weeks i i m filthy i tell you john dear i tried to comfort you didn t know you couldn t you aren t to blame you are young i knew that i had no comfort for agony such as his but i could not bear to leave him so i stayed hoping as i suppose foolish women have always hoped that just plain quiet loving him might help a little after a minute or two he said mary if you don t mind i i ve got to fight this out alone i went to my own room i put a cold water compress on my eyes and pulled down the window shades and lay on my bed i was mortal tired from sorrow and the hurt in my heart for john was sharp as a neuralgia pain but my mind went working right along independent of my feelings straight on like a phonograph if somebody had started it might keep right on grinding out a tune while the ship that it was on was sinking when miss macdonald came up bringing me some dinner which i couldn t touch i said to her it seems true but i know that it can t be it is too impossible i mean too far fetched not a bit of it she said the only impossible thing about it is the length of time it has taken us to discover it of course forgive me mrs magin i was almost on the trail once i had at least started in the right direction and then you threw me completely off i how she smiled at me by seeing something which you did not see but you are not in the least to blame for that the fault is all mine she went and shut my transom she looked through my clothes closet she looked under my bed saying as she did so the proverbial practise of old maids you know she came and sat close beside me now then she said chapter lviii the puzzle listen bit by bit it works into the whole like a picture puzzle each segment slipping right into place there is just one hole in it all and i think your danny s kindness and unselfishness will supply that necessary bit she began then to use her own way of saying it to put together the pieces of the puzzle she was right bit by bit it fitted together almost at once she came to the place that she had called a hole there is no hole there i told her under those circumstances danny would have been just sweet and unselfish and foolish enough to have done that very thing she did it that was why she was worried and unhappy all that day i m sure of it now then she went on danny s calling after gaby that day easy to understand now of course and leading straight to chad s suicide and confessional note gaby s fear martha s murder sam s ashes on the bag gaby s note to danny each one fitting right into place until spread in front of me was one of the most hideous pictures that any human being has ever been forced to look at only i gasped there can t be such wickedness in the world i mean not such long wickedness in all my experience she said i have never investigated another murder case where the thing was so cruelly vilely premeditated so wickedly cunningly carried out if this is true it will be also the first time that i have found a really brilliant mind belonging to a fiend if it is true i echoed but it is proven you have just proven it all to me she shook her head we have a seemingly perfect fabric made up wholly of circumstantial evidence as yet we have nothing else now i have a question to ask you it will seem to you that i should have asked you this at least a week ago i did not because i was certain that unless i shared all of my suspicions with you your answer would be exactly the answer that you gave me before now thinking as you think i want a very careful answer to this question when she had asked it i refused my first impulse to answer it at once and sat thinking carefully for several minutes the answer that i was forced to give then made me sick with shame no i said i didn t i thought honestly that i did but now i know that i didn t that that i knew i was chattering it puts canneziano s murder right at my door nonsense she folded one of my trembling hands into her steady capable hands we can t go poking about like that into the machinery of fate and stay sane the blame in this case is entirely for me but if i had not allowed myself to be misled then but had worked straight on something equally tragic might have happened we don t know what we do know is that no more time must be wasted i have spent this past week in trying to obtain the necessary proof i have failed now i am going to ask you to help me will you i will and gladly but you ll have to tell me what you want me to do i haven t the faintest idea she told me lands alive i said that ought to be easy i could see that she was annoyed i haven t found it so she said i have made three attempts as many as i dared make this week and have failed do you realize that it must come simply and naturally you must realize that see here i interrupted why not do as sam wants you to do why not arrest the criminal now and force the proof afterwards this sort of evidence could be gotten then as well as now and a lot safer too it seems to me mrs magin she said until we have evidence of guilt we have no criminal to arrest incredible as it seems we might still be wrong concerning every bit of this i once made a horrible mistake it was on my third case that is after i began to work for myself i don t talk about it i can t think about it but i made myself a promise then a promise that i have never broken and which i never will break except in extreme necessity proof positive and perfect must come before any accusation or arrest in a case of mine twice as i have said i have had men arrested because of circumstantial evidence each time the evidence was far stronger than anything we have in this case the first time the man would have undoubtedly escaped if he had not been put in confinement the second time was on my third case which i have mentioned if you force me to make this the third time i can t force you to do anything i reminded her hoping to cool her down a bit yes you can if you go at this so clumsily that you give the thing away and so endanger your own life i shall have to force matters i must of course risk a reputation i m not speaking of my own you understand in preference to risking a life again i am not speaking of my own but if we are wrong in this and remember we may be circumstantial evidence is the trickiest thing in the world it would be bitterly cruel and wrong it would be even worse than the other mistake of mine will you remember that when you make your first attempt yes i ll remember when do you want me to make the first attempt as soon as possible this afternoon if you can do it but how shall i do it i am going to leave that to you and to your natural wit you can do it much more spontaneously if you are not attempting to follow set directions but do do be careful don t make a mistake with that she left me i am ashamed to say that excitement had made me forget my sorrow i sat there saying my prayers planning and shaking in my shoes for a good half hour before i could get up enough courage to go downstairs in all probability the next hour would bring me face to face with the murderous fiend and not by the blink of an eye not by the ghost of a shiver must i betray my horrible knowledge chapter lix the fatal mistake when i finally did get myself downstairs i found sam seemingly alone in the living room playing solitaire i judged from the look he gave me and from the way he had his shoulders hunched that he was still in a right ugly humor where s everybody i asked out committing murders somewhere likely that s a nice way to talk isn t it he mumbled something what i said i can t hear you when you mutter like that i didn t talk much louder when i told miss macdonald about john s trying to make a getaway she heard me all right that s all the good it did do you know how much i trust that woman no i don t know i don t care either sam got out that silly shrill voice he has for talking when he is trying to mock a woman any woman and in using it he spoke up real loudly well mr stanley why not allow your son to go down and live with the ranch hands in their houses for a time since he is so eager to do so well what about that ahk sam barked she is head over heels in love with him that s a part of what is the matter with her i said i wish i thought so why do you wish that mary it was danny s voice her white face with the big sorrowful eyes peeked around the high back of a chair near the fireplace i was too taken aback to answer her how long have you been sitting there eavesdropping young lady sam asked i didn t mean to eavesdrop she answered quietly i am sorry i was reading and didn t hear anything until you began to mimic miss macdonald i heard all of that why does john wish to go down and live with the outfit john and sam had a little trouble to day i told her sam with his usual helpfulness in embarrassing situations pushed back his chair and went walking fast out of the room mary she questioned why aren t you my friend any more lands child i said if you mean that because i was wishing miss macdonald was in love with john it was only because i ve always reckoned that the more women in love with a man the better for him john loves you what do you care how many women love him john doesn t love me any more i suppose that was what he and uncle were quarreling about john wants to get away from me is that it and uncle sam is so good and so loyal that he won t allow it nothing like that i scoffed it was i left that sentence unfinished and went into the kitchen she followed me i went straight to the stove and picked up the lid lifter which as usual when i m not there to watch someone had left sticking up in a stove lid to get red hot instead of hanging it on the hook where it belonged i dropped it with a howl and wrapping my hand in my apron told her to run and get the linseed oil and limewater up in the hall bathroom for me i am not saying that i was not to blame i do say that if that fool child zinnia had not jumped around shouting sody sody wet sody s the best for burns and that if mrs ricker hadn t heard her screeching and come in too and begun asking questions i certainly would not have overlooked the fact that before she went to minister to my needs danny had picked up that lid lifter from where i had dropped it on the floor and had hung it on its hook she made a quick trip upstairs and down again with the bandages and the lotion she offered sweet and sympathetic to do up my hand for me i had noticed by that time that my hand was not smarting much but i was too excited to account for it reasonably i asked mrs ricker to attend to the bandages i had another job for danny i just came out here i said to make my weekly list to send to telko for supplies i can t write with this wadded up hand will you make the list for me danny zinnia please hand her the pad and pencil from the shelf zinnia brought it danny sat down by the table and picked up the pencil my heart thumped in my throat one crate of fallon melons i said danny pushed the pad and pencil across the table to mrs ricker perhaps you d as soon make the list for mary i have something to attend to upstairs go on now you ve started it danny i said you write such a neat pretty hand i presume my writing can be read mrs ricker replied as she picked up the pencil a crate of fallon melons did you say she wrote it down i heard danny running up the back stairway i felt flat as rolled dough from my disappointment in the next minute i had something more than disappointment to bother me i don t see zinnia said how you made out to burn yourself on that stove mrs magin miss canneziano was out here just a while ago wanting to make some tea the fire was dead out she boiled the water on the electric plate i ran to the stove it was as cold as winter time chapter lx the end i suppose it takes more than a minute for one s wits particularly if they happen to be thick wits to drain entirely away before mine had completely left me i had attempted to telephone to sam down in the outfit s quarters and had failed to get a reply to my call i had told mrs ricker and zinnia trying with all my might to hide my fear to run out and find sam or miss macdonald or hubert hand or john i had forgotten that john was upstairs in his room and to bring one or all of them to the house as quickly as possible to this day i don t know why they went without a question but they went running it was the slam of the screen door behind them i think bringing with it as it did the realization of my aloneness and the memory of miss macdonald s warning that turned me clear over to terror i shall not describe what i did nor what i thought during the time that i was alone there downstairs before help arrived the humorously inclined might think such a description amusing to me there is nothing amusing in the spectacle of an old woman being gripped and wrung by fright i longed to run from the house but i felt that i must stay there to explain the situation to the others when they came if they ever did come and to do my poor best since i had made the fatal mistake to prevent catastrophe by clock time it was only thirty six silent minutes that i had to wait before miss macdonald came alone and unhurried up the front steps and into the living room still holding sam s thirty thirty rifle in my hands i had known that i could never use it to shoot at any living thing but i had hoped that it might make me look dangerous i turned to meet her don t point that thing at me she commanded put it down what are you doing with it what is the trouble here before i could answer her sam mrs ricker and zinnia came clattering through the kitchen mrs ricker was wringing her hands and saying over and over in a voice all broken and mutilated with horror i have gone insane i have gone insane i have gone insane sam said gabrielle canneziano just now waved at us from her window miss macdonald turned and ran like a wild thing up the stairs just as she disappeared from our sight the sound of a pistol s shot cracked through the place i followed the others i ran up the steps i stumbled down the hall behind them and into gabrielle canneziano s room i saw gabrielle canneziano her cheeks painted her lips reddened long earrings dangling from her ears lying on the couch over her breast was a widening spot of color staining the fringes of the soft white silk dressing gown that she was wearing on the floor was a smoking revolver john came he said she told me what she was going to do i allowed her to do it i did not want nevada to have to execute a woman chapter lxi epilogue sam says bitterly that the only thing i need to explain is the one thing that can ever be explained how one girl by changing her clothes and by washing her face could turn a houseful of supposedly sensible people into a packet of blithering bat blind fools for a generous period of time i can explain that i think but i am going to leave it until later and go clear back to the second of july the day that gabrielle received the code letter in her talk with john john says it was in no sense a confession that it was nothing but a taunt for us all a final regretless high fling of defiance there in his room during the twenty minutes or so that she talked to him before she shot herself some things which might still not be clear to us were made plain also many of miss macdonald s previously formed opinions were directly or indirectly verified miss macdonald had said you remember that the murder had been wickedly premeditated when i read that letter gabrielle said to john and found myself penniless and planless on a nevada ranch i at once made up my mind to kill danielle the little fool and take her place how she persuaded danny to accept the idea of the masquerade and to change clothes with her on the fourth of july we do not positively know that is the hole that miss macdonald mentioned in her puzzle to my mind there is little doubt that she gained her way very easily by using her own unhappiness and disappointment as tools with which to remove danny s scruples and prod her pity i am sure remembering danny s troubled manner at the time that she consented unwillingly that she thoroughly disliked the idea and that she was afraid of its consequences when the two girls went upstairs together on the afternoon of the fourth of july they must have gone to effect the transformation perhaps then for a brief minute or two the thing did seem amusing to danny for i know that i heard the girls laughing together as i have mentioned when i was on my errand upstairs we do not know when the disguise had been completed by what pretext gabrielle lured danny into the attic their trunks were in the attic there could be a dozen simple reasons why danny might consent to go up there with her coming downstairs again gabrielle caught her by the throat and strangled her instantly by means of the deadly jiu jitsu hold which she had learned from her strangler lover it is a hold that requires little strength though gabrielle s trained fingers were strong enough but much scientific skill she took the earrings from danny s ears or perhaps danny had not yet put them on went to her own room arranged her make up got into the wrap which completely covered danny s clothes that she was wearing pulled the hat down over her eyes to conceal the change in hairdressing and walked through the living room for us all to see her at four o clock when chad went to the porch with her this john found out by insistent questioning she told him that danny had left the house earlier by the back way that she and danny had arranged a joke on the rest of us to enliven the dull afternoon and asked him to help with it by calling in danny s voice to her when he came back into the house chad did it that was why since he was standing down by the front doors the voice supposed to come from the upper hall had a strained and an unnatural sound gabrielle had reckoned that chad in spite of her request would be too stupid to discover the facts probably she thought that at any rate she would be able to impose silence upon him it was one of her many mistakes we think that he must have known for the remainder of the afternoon that gabrielle was masquerading as danny his happy mood was caused by the fact that gabrielle had given him a confidence and had allowed him to perform a small service for her when he saw what had happened and when he realized that the girl whom he had worshipped was a murderer he killed himself strange that in spite of everything he still loved her enough to leave the confessional note to shield her the men think that he left the note to shield the rest of us rather than to shield her i do not believe it she had planned to go straight around the house and re enter it through the back door martha s being by the rabbit hutch was something she had not counted on it was necessary to distract martha s attention and to get her to come at once into the house she gave her the monkey bracelet as she did so probably because of the act of kindness martha made one of her frequent mistakes and called gabrielle danny gabrielle told john concerning martha john also questioned her insistently that she then showed martha the poison in the charm and told her that it was a love potion that would make chad love her like a lady if she would swallow it and never tell anyone anything about it that of course was martha s secret concerning the happy surprise that had to do with herself and chad martha out of the way gaby must have run quickly around to the back of the house and up the back stairway to toss the hat and wrap back on the body replace the earrings scatter the pipe ashes over the beaded bag i declare to goodness i can more easily think of her lying there in her white silk dressing gown than i can think of her brushing those pipe ashes up from somewhere in order to save them for that purpose and drop the tatting shuttle there required not more than one or two minutes of time another two or three minutes to wash her face thoroughly and to douse on some of danny s perfume and she was coming downstairs again with the headache that necessitated the drawing of the curtains to make her safety a bit safer just at first she told john that those few minutes when she had to walk through the room make the trip around the house and get upstairs again were the only moments of fright that she had had from the first to the last once safely established in the r le of danny she said she knew that she had nothing to fear i think however that there were other times when she was afraid i am certain that real fear was there in her room that day when the engagement ring dropped from her finger though i believe that her fear then was caused wholly from superstition and not from any dread that the slight difference between her hands and danny s hands might be noticed i am sure that her fear for john on the fourth of july was real enough she knew that each minute he was away longer than the time necessary for the trip was a minute lost from the perfect alibi she had so mistakenly tried to arrange for him by sending him away from the ranch she had not known that danny s fingers had closed on the stair s tread when john came in the back way she was afraid that it would be remembered later as it was and that someone would suspect as hubert hand did suspect that john had carried the body in at that time she had counted on her note to danny and on the fact that as danny she was downstairs within ten or twelve minutes after the time we had seen gaby walking down the path and had heard danny s voice calling after her to prove her own innocence they and the gentleness of danny s disposition did this to perfection her original plan had been to prove that sam was the murderer with sam out of the way and with john in possession of his fortune she had thought i suppose that she would have no trouble in persuading john to leave the desert moon but she was afraid of the idea knowing john s devotion to sam she could not reckon with any sureness how disgrace and sorrow might affect john it was too big a risk to take unreservedly so though she picked the quarrel with sam strewed the pipe ashes on the bag put the key in the fireplace wrote on the photograph she left loopholes in the shapes of the many other false clues it is only my own notion that if she had not thought the definite accusation of sam which she made during the session on the fifth of july was necessary to protect john she would have backed out by that time and not have made it it is again only my notion that the request which she put in her note to danny to have danny take her body to san francisco for cremation was made because she thought that it would be desirable for her to be able to leave the ranch at once perhaps for several weeks mrs ricker s expressed suspicion probably made her realize the wisdom of returning as rapidly as possible to the desert moon gabrielle canneziano was a born criminal almost all of her life had been spent among criminals she knew their ways and she knew the ways of honest people toward them consequently she was too clever to drop her disguise even for a minute in san francisco when on the afternoon of the fourth of july she had come downstairs as danny she had come resolved from that time forth to be danny in thought and in deed up to the level best of her ability that she never doubted her ability to turn from black to white within the space of an hour is a splendid example of miss macdonald s contention concerning the egotism of criminals miss macdonald says that her first real clue was the one i gave to her when i said that no one except gaby herself who would do such a wicked thing had ever been on the ranch if she had been on the ranch she might have committed the murder she had all three of the primary motives for murder love revenge and greed the unique feature in this case miss macdonald says that each case has its unique feature was that the murdered girl had been a duplicate twin the hazy incomplete notion miss macdonald says had just come into her mind she had not begun to accept it she was only allowing it dimly to take form when i returned to the room that day with my hand full of letters written by danny handwriting as surely as fingerprints miss macdonald says proves identity she asked me straight whether i had seen danny writing the checks and addressing the envelopes i answered straight and positively that i had and not twenty minutes before that miss macdonald had warned me that people often thought that they saw things they did not see i had not i had seen the person whom i supposed was danny writing checks and addressing envelopes i had turned my back on her and had walked to the door when she called after me and gave me the envelopes containing the checks danny herself had written those checks and had addressed those envelopes on the third of july owing to all the furore that had been going on in the house that day she had left her desk before she had torn the checks from her check book and had never gone back to it to finish her task it is possible that gabrielle had deliberately arranged that also but i think not at any rate she had had the checks in her possession and had waited for a date that had a three or an eight in it to produce them circumstances and i played well into her hands that day she had only to insert a one in front of the three to make me her fool miss macdonald as you have seen blames herself and not me for the mistake she says that she should have known better than to believe me or to quote her exactly she should have doubted your accuracy of observation but not until the morning that we found daniel canneziano murdered did it occur to her to doubt it she says that it was not clairvoyance not intuition not even common sense that it was nothing but a memory that took her that morning straight back to the idea that gabrielle canneziano could be the guilty person oddly the conviction had come to her before we found canneziano s body sitting across the table from gabrielle posing as danny that morning at breakfast she had thought idly of the breakfast that she and danny had had together in the dining car she had taken her chair that morning just as danny had handed the order slip for her breakfast to the waiter too vaguely to be certain that it was really a memory she seemed to see that slip of paper covered with writing just then with the aroma of coffee in her nostrils and with her iced grapefruit and rolls in front of her she remembered that it was the same breakfast both she and danny had had that morning would such a small order cover an order slip with handwriting not it was certain with the neat handwriting that had made out those checks and addressed those envelopes right then she resolved to lose no more time to get as soon as possible a sample of the handwriting of the girl who was sitting across the table from her canneziano s murder discovered in the next half hour strengthened her vague suspicions into as much of a certainty as she ever allowed herself before she had positive evidence as i have written she spent the following week in efforts to get that evidence at last fearing that she was suspected she detailed the task to me you have seen how i failed how gabrielle at once saw through my trick of attempting to disable my right hand by burning it and how realizing that she was trapped she had run upstairs first to satisfy her longing to be herself again even for a few brief minutes then to taunt john and finally to take her own life for i think in spite of her denials to john that she killed herself because she knew that she was trapped though her vanity and her audacity held to the end i knew i should have no trouble in making you believe that silly doll story she said it was the truth i knew too that the dick would read the code letter she was so slow about it that i had to steal it to make her do it it was time you see for the gentle danielle s story to be verified i knew that the dick had a copy of it she d been baiting me with the thing i have kept a step or two ahead of her lumbering pace all the time don t fancy that i had overlooked the matter of the handwriting i m not a fool i thought of it before i killed the girl there were a dozen ways i could have gotten around it could yet get around it if necessary i could even have disabled my own right hand i had rather planned at first to do that but later i found that i loved my pretty little white hand better than i had supposed just as i have discovered that i loved the gay gaby better than i had supposed so well indeed that i have decided that death as gaby is infinitely preferable to life as the shiny nosed danielle i have seen this coming i have not cared i got rid of that cur canneziano not because i was afraid of him but because he tried to double cross me i had promised to do much for him after you and i were married and he would have sold me out for a few thousand dollars he came here hoping that danny might pay him a pretty sum for his silence about my past he knew his muttons she would have been fool enough to have done it poor slain sister stuff more to be pitied than blamed all that you know he should have played with me instead of against me i had a few old scores to settle with him most of my rage about the money was because i had thought it would be such good fun to get the best of him and i did so that is all right i hid in his room early that evening it was frightfully amusing to watch him locking his door and his windows to make his sleep a safe one it was i did the job so neatly that he never woke at all for that matter it has all been amusing you have all been such utter fools but i am tired of it now oh very tired particularly i am tired of my cruel plan to destroy the gay gaby by burying her alive i am going now to do it in a swifter kinder way sam insists that her success even for so short a time is an indictment against all of us that it shows that none of us was capable of looking deeper than clothes and face paint i do not agree with him gabrielle was a professional actress she had lived with danny long enough to learn all her ways her mannerisms her habits in conversation she did not dupe chad who loved her and who was an expert in voices she did not dupe canneziano who had known both of the girls all their lives the murder itself by stupefying us all with horror with fear with suspicions did much to help her but without that dulling of our perceptions i think that the imposture would have been successful at the time of the murder the two girls had been on the ranch with us less than two months strangers never get much deeper than surfaces in so short a time there was nothing remarkable it seems to me about her being able quite easily to deceive all of us with the single glaring exception of john john is one of a large class of people who could all be filed under the recipe for simple acceptors it is a necessary class a class that acts as an oil to the hinges of the world making it move smoothly the gentle thoroughly honest class that by quietly believing what it is told to believe keeps us out of revolutions and rebellions and the like i am not saying that the doubters and the rebels are not necessary as sam would say it takes that sort to make all sorts but heaven help us if they predominated when john came home from rattail on the fourth of july he was faced with the apparent fact that danny in the course of a few hours had changed essentially that was what had bothered him so what had made him jerk his head and blink his eyes and complain of a touch of sun john had never recognized much less admitted to himself that there was the slightest similarity between the two girls consequently in spite of a change danny must be danny she looked like danny she talked like danny and we all said that she was danny john believed very shortly after that john was faced with another apparent fact gaby had been murdered he could see that with his own eyes as we all could see it he at once set the fact of danny s change against the fact of gaby s murder and there he stuck fast too loyal to go further too dismayed to retreat he did not believe that danny had killed gabrielle he had known danny too well to harbor such a belief he was forced to believe that she knew who had done it consequently her accusation of sam could be nothing but a wicked accusation only danny could not be wicked the mystery was a torture which danny s presence intensified unbearably so he avoided her and unable to blame her for anything blamed himself and hated himself for his suspicions and for his failing loyalty i ll venture though it can be only a venture that the realization of his interest in miss macdonald and his inability to be rid of it was another cause for john s befuddlement that interest of course has all disappeared for the present though he despised himself for it john might have been untrue to a changed living danny might in the end have jilted her meanly john is male but to a danny who is no longer living john now must always be true john is young i reckon he has fine honest plans for being faithful to her memory for the remainder of his life miss macdonald is also young and lovely and heart whole she has promised to come and visit us for a month next june just now with our thermometers at fifty below zero and our chilblains burning and the coyotes piercing the nights with their lank long frozen screeches and the cold old owls always grieving forth their mournful chuck a loo whoo whoo whoo s june looks mighty far away but five fingers and a thumb and she will be here smelling of sunshine and tasting like smiles painting our deserts with rainbow colors for as far as the eyes can see spreading sunsets that catch you right up into their midsts offering dawns that share their youth with you and that make you believe all over again in things which you had long ago stopped believing now i don t know shucks about romance but i have a notion that june in our northeastern nevada stirs up whole batches of the stuff i am counting on her to serve it fresh and sweet this year it isn t june though and it isn t romance that i am trusting for the final chore it is something more lasting than either something sturdier something for which i can not find a name but i know that it is induced by a mixture of long years of right living and clean thinking and sanity and courage so i am expecting it to clear away the shadows from the desert moon and leave it riding high as it used to ride high and proud a brave shining thing in our valley the end transcriber s note this transcription follows the text of edition published by grosset dunlap however the following errors have been corrected from the original
