castle slept in the sunshine dancing little ripples of heat mist played across its smooth lawns and stone flagged terraces the air was full of the lulling drone of insects it was that gracious hour of a summer afternoon midway between luncheon and tea when nature seems to unbutton its waistcoat and put its feet up in the shade of a laurel bush outside the back premises of this stately home of england beach butler to clarence ninth earl of emsworth its proprietor sat sipping the contents of a long glass and reading a weekly paper devoted to the doings of society and the stage his attention had just been arrested by a photograph in an oval border on one of the inner pages and for perhaps a minute he scrutinized this in a slow thorough pop eyed way absorbing its every detail then with a fruity chuckle he took a penknife from his pocket cut out the photograph and placed it in the recesses of his costume at this moment the laurel bush which had hitherto not spoken said psst the butler started violently a spasm ran through his ample frame beach said the bush something was now peering out of it this might have been a wood nymph but the butler rather thought not and he was right it was a tall young man with light hair he recognized his employer s secretary mr hugo carmody and rose with pained reproach his heart was still jumping and he had bitten his tongue startle you beach extremely sir i m sorry excellent for the liver though beach do you want to earn a quid the butler s austerity softened the hard look died out of his eyes yes sir can you get hold of miss millicent alone certainly sir then give her this note and don t let anyone see you do it especially and this is where i want you to follow me very closely beach lady constance keeble i will attend to the matter immediately sir he smiled a paternal smile hugo smiled back a perfect understanding prevailed between these two beach understood that he ought not to be giving his employer s niece surreptitious notes and hugo understood that he ought not to be urging a good man to place such a weight upon his conscience perhaps you are not aware sir said the butler having trousered the wages of sin that her ladyship went up to london on the three thirty train hugo uttered an exclamation of chagrin you mean that all this red indian stuff creeping from bush to bush and not letting a single twig snap beneath my feet has simply been a waste of time he emerged dusting his clothes i wish i d known that before he said i ve severely injured a good suit and it s a very moot question whether i haven t got some kind of a beetle down my back however nobody ever took a toss through being careful very true sir relieved by the information that the x ray eye of the aunt of the girl he loved was operating elsewhere mr carmody became conversational nice day beach yes sir you know beach life s rummy i mean to say you can never tell what the future holds in store here i am at blandings castle loving it sing of joy sing of bliss home was never like this and yet when the project of my coming here was first placed on the agenda i don t mind telling you the heart was rather bowed down with weight of woe indeed sir yes noticeably bowed down if you knew the circumstances you would understand why beach did know the circumstances there were few facts concerning the dwellers in blandings castle of which he remained in ignorance for long he was aware that young mr carmody had been until a few weeks back co proprietor with mr ronald fish lord emsworth s nephew of a night club called the hot spot situated just off bond street in the heart of london s pleasure seeking area that despite this favoured position it had proved a financial failure that mr ronald had gone off with his mother lady julia fish to recuperate at biarritz and that hugo on the insistence of ronnie that unless some niche was found for his boyhood friend he would not stir a step toward biarritz or any other blighted place had come to blandings as lord emsworth s private secretary no doubt you were reluctant to leave london sir exactly but now beach believe me or believe me not as far as i am concerned anyone who likes can have london mark you i m not saying that just one brief night in the piccadilly neighbourhood would come amiss but to dwell in give me blandings castle what a spot beach yes sir a garden of eden shall i call it certainly sir if you wish and now that old ronnie s coming here joy as you might say will be unconfined is mr ronald expected sir coming either to morrow or the day after i had a letter from him this morning which reminds me he sends his regards to you and asks me to tell you to put your shirt on baby bones for the medbury selling plate the butler pursed his lips dubiously a long shot sir not generally fancied rank outsider leave it alone is my verdict and yet mr ronald is usually very reliable it is many years now since he first began to advise me in these matters and i have done remarkably well by following him even as a lad at eton he was always singularly fortunate in his information well suit yourself said hugo indifferently what was that thing you were cutting out of the paper just now a photograph of mr galahad sir i keep an album in which i paste items of interest relating to the family what that album needs is an eyewitness s description of lady constance keeble falling out of a window and breaking her neck a nice sense of the proprieties prevented beach from indorsing this view verbally but he sighed a little wistfully he had frequently felt much the same about the chatelaine of blandings if you would care to see the clipping sir there is a reference to mr galahad s literary work most of the photographs in the weekly paper over which beach had been relaxing were of peeresses trying to look like chorus girls and chorus girls trying to look like peeresses but this one showed the perky features of a dapper little gentleman in the late fifties beneath it in large letters was the single word gally under this ran a caption in smaller print the hon galahad threepwood brother of the earl of emsworth a little bird tells us that gally is at blandings castle shropshire the ancestral seat of the family busily engaged in writing his reminiscences as every member of the old brigade will testify they ought to be as warm as the weather if not warmer hugo scanned the exhibit thoughtfully and handed it back to be placed in the archives yes he observed i should say that about summed it up that old bird must have been pretty hot stuff i imagine back in the days of edward the confessor mr galahad was somewhat wild as a young man agreed the butler with a sort of feudal pride in his voice it was the opinion of the servants hall that the hon galahad shed lustre on blandings castle has it ever occurred to you beach that that book of his is going to make no small stir when it comes out frequently sir well i m saving up for my copy by the way i knew there was something i wanted to ask you can you give me any information on the subject of a bloke named baxter mr baxter sir he used to be private secretary to his lordship yes so i gathered lady constance was speaking to me about him this morning she happened upon me as i was taking the air in riding kit and didn t seem over pleased you appear to enjoy a great deal of leisure mr carmody she said mr baxter she continued giving me the meaning eye never seemed to find time to go riding when he was lord emsworth s secretary mr baxter was always so hard at work but then mr baxter she added the old lamp becoming more meaning than ever loved his work mr baxter took a real interest in his duties dear me what a very conscientious man mr baxter was to be sure or words to that effect i may be wrong but i classed it as a dirty dig and what i want to know is if baxter was such a world beater why did they ever let him go the butler gazed about him cautiously i fancy sir there was some trouble pinched the spoons eh always the way with these zealous workers i never succeeded in learning the full details sir but there was something about some flower pots he pinched the flower pots threw them at his lordship i was given to understand hugo looked injured he was a high spirited young man who chafed at injustice well i m dashed if i see then he said where this baxter can claim to rank so jolly high above me as a secretary i may be leisurely i may forget to answer letters i may occasionally on warm afternoons go in to some extent for the folding of the hands in sleep but at least i don t throw flower pots at people not so much as a pen wiper have i ever bunged at lord emsworth well i must be getting about my duties that ride this morning and a slight slumber after lunch have set the schedule back a bit you won t forget that note will you no sir hugo reflected on second thoughts he said perhaps you d better hand it back to me safer not to have too much written matter circulating about the place just tell miss millicent that she will find me in the rose garden at six sharp in the rose garden at six sharp very good sir i will see that she receives the information ii for two hours after this absolutely nothing happened in the grounds of blandings castle at the end of that period there sounded through the mellow drowsy stillness a drowsy mellow chiming it was the clock over the stables striking five simultaneously a small but noteworthy procession filed out of the house and made its way across the sun bathed lawn to where the big cedar cast a grateful shade it was headed by james a footman bearing a laden tray following him came thomas another footman with a gate leg table the rear was brought up by beach who carried nothing but merely lent a tone the instinct that warns all good englishmen when tea is ready immediately began to perform its silent duty even as thomas set gate leg table to earth there appeared as if answering a cue an elderly gentleman in stained tweeds and a hat he should have been ashamed of clarence ninth earl of emsworth in person he was a long lean stringy man of about sixty slightly speckled at the moment with mud for he had spent most of the afternoon pottering round pigsties he surveyed the preparations for the meal with vague amiability through rimless pince nez tea yes your lordship oh said lord emsworth ah tea eh tea yes tea quite so to be sure tea capital one gathered from his remarks that he realized that the tea hour had arrived and was glad of it he proceeded to impart his discovery to his niece millicent who lured by that same silent call had just appeared at his side tea millicent yes er tea said lord emsworth driving home his point millicent sat down and busied herself with the pot she was a tall fair girl with soft blue eyes and a face like the soul s awakening her whole appearance radiated wholesome innocence not even an expert could have told that she had just received a whispered message from a bribed butler and was proposing at six sharp to go and meet a quite ineligible young man among the rose bushes been down seeing the empress uncle clarence eh oh yes yes my dear i have been with her all the afternoon lord emsworth s mild eyes beamed they always did when that noble animal empress of blandings was mentioned the ninth earl was a man of few and simple ambitions he had never desired to mould the destinies of the state to frame its laws and make speeches in the house of lords that would bring all the peers and bishops to their feet whooping and waving their hats all he yearned to do by way of insuring admittance to england s hall of fame was to tend his prize sow empress of blandings so sedulously that for the second time in two consecutive years she would win the silver medal in the fat pigs class at the shropshire agricultural show and every day it seemed to him the glittering prize was coming more and more within his grasp earlier in the summer there had been one breathless sickening moment of suspense and disaster had seemed to loom this was when his neighbour sir gregory parsloe parsloe of matchingham hall had basely lured away his pig man the superbly gifted george cyril wellbeloved by the promise of higher wages for a while lord emsworth had feared lest the empress mourning for her old friend and valet might refuse food and fall from her high standard of obesity but his apprehensions had proved groundless the empress had taken to pirbright george cyril s successor from the first and was tucking away her meals with all the old abandon the right triumphs in this world far more often than we realize what do you do to her asked millicent curiously read her bedtime stories lord emsworth pursed his lips he had a reverent mind and disliked jesting on serious subjects whatever i do my dear it seems to effect its purpose she is in wonderful shape i didn t know she had a shape she hadn t when i last saw her this time lord emsworth smiled indulgently gibes at the empress s rotundity had no sting for him he did not desire for her that schoolgirl slimness which is so fashionable nowadays she has never fed more heartily he said it is a treat to watch her i m so glad mr carmody said millicent stooping to tickle a spaniel which had wandered up to take pot luck told me he had never seen a finer animal in his life i like that young man said lord emsworth emphatically he is sound on pigs he has his head screwed on the right way yes he s an improvement on baxter isn t he baxter his lordship choked over his cup you didn t like baxter much did you uncle clarence hadn t a peaceful moment while he was in the place dreadful feller always fussing always wanting me to do things always coming round corners with his infernal spectacles gleaming and making me sign papers when i wanted to be out in the garden besides he was off his head thank goodness i ve seen the last of baxter but have you what do you mean if you ask me said millicent aunt constance hasn t given up the idea of getting him back lord emsworth started with such violence that his pince nez fell off she had touched on his favourite nightmare sometimes he would wake trembling in the night fancying that his late secretary had returned to the castle and though on these occasions he always dropped off to sleep again with a happy smile of relief he had never ceased to be haunted by the fear that his sister constance in her infernal managing way was scheming to restore the fellow to office good god has she said anything to you no but i have a feeling i know she doesn t like mr carmody lord emsworth exploded perfect nonsense utter absolute dashed nonsense what on earth does she find to object to in young carmody most capable intelligent boy leaves me alone doesn t fuss me i wish to heaven she would he broke off and stared blankly at a handsome woman of middle age who had come out of the house and was crossing the lawn why here she is said millicent equally and just as disagreeably surprised i thought you had gone up to london aunt constance lady constance keeble had arrived at the table declining with a distrait shake of the head her niece s offer of the seat of honour by the teapot she sank into a chair she was a woman of still remarkable beauty with features cast in a commanding mould and fine eyes these eyes were at the moment dull and brooding i missed my train she explained however i can do all i have to do in london to morrow i shall go up by the eleven fifteen in a way it will be more convenient for ronald will be able to motor me back i will look in at norfolk street and pick him up there before he starts what made you miss your train yes said lord emsworth complainingly you started in good time the brooding look in his sister s eyes deepened i met sir gregory parsloe lord emsworth stiffened at the name he kept me talking he is extremely worried lord emsworth looked pleased he tells me he used to know galahad very well a number of years ago and he is very much alarmed about this book of his and i bet he isn t the only one murmured millicent she was right once a man of the hon galahad threepwood s antecedents starts taking pen in hand and being reminded of amusing incidents that happened to my dear old friend so and so you never know where he will stop and all over england among the more elderly of the nobility and gentry something like a panic had been raging ever since the news of his literary activities had got about from sir gregory parsloe parsloe of matchingham hall to gray headed pillars of society in distant cumberland and kent whole droves of respectable men who in their younger days had been rash enough to chum with the hon galahad were recalling past follies committed in his company and speculating agitatedly as to how good the old pest s memory was for galahad in his day had been a notable lad about town a beau sabreur of romano s a pink un a pelican a crony of hughie drummond and fatty coleman a brother in arms of the shifter the pitcher peter blobbs and the rest of an interesting but not straitlaced circle bookmakers had called him by his pet name barmaids had simpered beneath his gallant chaff he had heard the chimes at midnight and when he looked in at the old gardenia commissionaires had fought for the privilege of throwing him out a man in a word who should never have been taught to write and who if unhappily gifted with that ability should have been restrained by act of parliament from writing reminiscences so thought lady constance his sister so thought sir gregory parsloe parsloe his neighbour and so thought the pillars of society in distant cumberland and kent widely as they differed on many points they were unanimous on this he wanted me to try to find out if galahad was putting anything about him into it better ask him now said millicent he s just come out of the house and seems to be heading in this direction lady constance turned sharply and following her niece s pointing finger winced the mere sight of her deplorable brother was generally enough to make her wince when he began to talk and she had to listen the wince became a shudder his conversations had the effect of making her feel as if she had suddenly swallowed something acid it always makes me laugh said millicent when i think what a frightfully bad shot uncle gally s godfathers and godmothers made when they christened him she regarded her approaching relative with that tolerant indeed admiring affection which the young of her sex even when they have madonna like faces are only too prone to lavish on such of their seniors as have had interesting pasts doesn t he look marvellous she said it really is an extraordinary thing that anyone who has had as good a time as he has can be so amazingly healthy everywhere you look you see men leading model lives and pegging out in their prime while good old uncle gally who apparently never went to bed till he was fifty is still breezing along as fit and rosy as ever all our family have had excellent constitutions said lord emsworth and i ll bet uncle gally needed every ounce of his said millicent the author ambling briskly across the lawn had now joined the little group at the tea table as his photograph had indicated he was a short trim dapper little man of the type one associates automatically in one s mind with checked suits tight trousers white bowler hats pink carnations and race glasses bumping against the left hip though bareheaded at the moment and in his shirt sleeves and displaying on the tip of his nose the ink spot of the literary life he still seemed out of place away from a paddock or an american bar his bright eyes puckered at the corners peered before him as though watching horses rounding into the straight his neatly shod foot had about it a suggestion of pawing in search of a brass rail a jaunty little gentleman and as millicent had said quite astonishingly fit and rosy a thoroughly misspent life had left the hon galahad threepwood contrary to the most elementary justice in what appeared to be perfect even exuberantly perfect physical condition how a man who ought to have had the liver of the century could look and behave as he did was a constant mystery to his associates his eyes were not dimmed nor his natural force abated and when skipping blithely across the turf he tripped over the spaniel so graceful was the agility with which he recovered his balance that he did not spill a drop of the whisky and soda in his hand he continued to bear the glass aloft like some brave banner beneath which he had often fought and won instead of the blot on a proud family he might have been a teetotal acrobat having disentangled himself from the spaniel and soothed the animal s wounded feelings by permitting it to sniff the whisky and soda the hon galahad produced a black rimmed monocle and screwing it into his eye surveyed the table with a frown of distaste tea millicent reached for a cup cream and sugar uncle gally he stopped her with a gesture of shocked loathing you know i never drink tea too much respect for my inside don t tell me you are ruining your inside with that poison sorry uncle gally i like it you be careful urged the hon galahad who was fond of his niece and did not like to see her falling into bad habits you be very careful how you fool about with that stuff did i ever tell you about poor buffy struggles back in ninety three some misguided person lured poor old buffy into one of those temperance lectures illustrated with coloured slides and he called on me next day ashen poor old chap ashen gally he said what would you say the procedure was when a fellow wants to buy tea how would a fellow set about it tea i said what do you want tea for to drink said buffy pull yourself together dear boy i said you re talking wildly you can t drink tea have a brandy and soda no more alcohol for me said buffy look what it does to the common earthworm but you re not a common earthworm i said putting my finger on the flaw in his argument right away i dashed soon shall be if i go on drinking alcohol said buffy well i begged him with tears in my eyes not to do anything rash but i couldn t move him he ordered in ten pounds of the muck and was dead inside the year good heavens really the hon galahad nodded impressively dead as a doornail got run over by a hansom cab poor dear old chap as he was crossing piccadilly you ll find the story in my book how s the book coming along magnificently my dear splendidly i had no notion writing was so easy the stuff just pours out clarence i wanted to ask you about a date what year was it there was that terrible row between young gregory parsloe and lord burper when parsloe stole the old chap s false teeth and pawned them at a shop in the edgware road i should have said later than that or perhaps you re right though i ll pencil in tentatively lady constance uttered a sharp cry the sunlight had now gone quite definitely out of her life she felt as she so often felt in her brother galahad s society as if foxes were gnawing her vitals not even the thought that she could now give sir gregory parsloe parsloe the inside information for which he had asked was able to comfort her galahad you are not proposing to print libellous stories like that about our nearest neighbour certainly i am the hon galahad snorted militantly and as for libel let him bring an action if he wants to i ll fight him to the house of lords it s the best documented story in my book well if you insist it was clarence i ll tell you what said the hon galahad inspired i ll say toward the end of the nineties after all the exact date isn t so important it s the facts that matter and leaping lightly over the spaniel he flitted away across the lawn lady constance sat rigid in her chair her fine eyes were now protruding slightly and her face was drawn this and not the mona lisa s you would have said looking at her was the head on which all the sorrows of the world had fallen clarence my dear what are you going to do about this do can t you see that something must be done do you realize that if this awful book of galahad s is published it will alienate half our friends they will think we are to blame they will say we ought to have stopped him somehow imagine sir gregory s feelings when he reads that appalling story lord emsworth s amiable face darkened i am not worrying about parsloe s feelings besides he did steal burper s false teeth i remember him showing them to me he had them packed up in cotton wool in a small cigar box the gesture known as wringing the hands is one that is seldom seen in real life but lady constance keeble at this point did something with hers which might by a liberal interpretation have been described as wringing oh if mr baxter were only here she moaned lord emsworth started with such violence that his pince nez fell off and he dropped a slice of seed cake what on earth do you want that awful feller here for he would find a way out of this dreadful business he was always so efficient baxter s off his head lady constance uttered a sharp exclamation clarence you really can be the most irritating person in the world you get an idea and you cling to it in spite of whatever anybody says mr baxter was the most wonderfully capable man i ever met yes capable of anything retorted lord emsworth with spirit threw flower pots at me in the middle of the night i woke up in the small hours and found flower pots streaming in at my bedroom window and looked out and there was this feller baxter standing on the terrace in lemon coloured pajamas hurling the dashed things as if he thought he was a machine gun or something i suppose he s in an asylum by this time lady constance had turned a bright scarlet even in their nursery days she had never felt quite so hostile toward the head of the family as now you know perfectly well that there was a quite simple explanation my diamond necklace had been stolen and mr baxter thought the thief had hidden it in one of the flower pots he went to look for it and got locked out and tried to attract attention by well i prefer to think the man was crazy and that s the line that galahad takes in his book his galahad is not putting that story in his book of course he s putting it in his book do you think he s going to waste excellent material like that and as i say the line galahad takes and he s a clear thinking level headed man is that baxter was a raving roaring lunatic well i m going to have another look at the empress he pottered off pigward iii for some moments after he had gone there was silence at the tea table millicent lay back in her chair lady constance sat stiffly upright in hers a little breeze that brought with it a scent of wallflowers began whispering the first tidings that the cool of evening was on its way why are you so anxious to get mr baxter back aunt constance asked millicent lady constance s rigidity had relaxed she was looking her calm masterful self again she had the air of a woman who has just solved a difficult problem i think his presence here essential she said uncle clarence doesn t seem to agree with you your uncle clarence has always been completely blind to his best interests he ought never to have dismissed the only secretary he has ever had who was capable of looking after his affairs isn t mr carmody any good no he is not and i shall never feel easy in my mind until mr baxter is back in his old place what s wrong with mr carmody he is grossly inefficient and said lady constance unmasking her batteries i consider that he spends far too much of his time mooning around you my dear he appears to imagine that he is at blandings castle simply to dance attendance on you the charge struck millicent as unjust she thought of pointing out that she and hugo only met occasionally and then on the sly but it occurred to her that the plea might be injudicious she bent over the spaniel a keen observer might have noted a defensiveness in her manner she looked like a girl preparing to cope with an aunt do you find him an entertaining companion millicent yawned mr carmody no not particularly a dull young man i should have thought deadly vapid vap to a degree and yet you went riding with him last tuesday anything s better than riding alone you play tennis with him too well tennis is a game i defy you to play by yourself lady constance s lips tightened i wish ronald had never persuaded your uncle to employ him clarence should have seen by the mere look of him that he was impossible she paused it will be nice having ronald here she said yes you must try to see something of him if said lady constance in the manner which her intimates found rather less pleasant than some of her other manners mr carmody can spare you for a moment from time to time she eyed her niece narrowly but millicent was a match for any number of narrow glances and had been from her sixteenth birthday she was also a girl who believed that the best form of defence is attack do you think i m in love with mr carmody aunt constance lady constance was not a woman who relished the direct methods of the younger generation she coloured such a thought never entered my head that s fine i was afraid it had a sensible girl like you would naturally see the utter impossibility of marriage with a man in his position he has no money and very little prospects and of course your uncle holds your own money in trust for you and would never dream of releasing it if you wished to make an unsuitable marriage so it does seem lucky i m not in love with him doesn t it extremely fortunate lady constance paused for a moment then introduced a topic on which she had frequently touched before millicent had seen it coming by the look in her eyes why you won t marry ronald i can t think it would be so suitable in every way you have been fond of one another since you were children oh i like old ronnie a lot it has been a great disappointment to your aunt julia she must cheer up she ll get him off all right if she sticks at it lady constance bridled it is not a question of if you will forgive my saying so my dear i think you have allowed yourself to fall into a way of taking ronald far too much for granted i am afraid you have the impression that he will always be there ready and waiting for you when you at last decide to make up your mind i don t think you realize what a very attractive young man he is the longer i wait the more fascinating it will give him time to become at a moment less tense lady constance would have taken time off to rebuke this flippancy but she felt it would be unwise to depart from her main theme he is just the sort of young man that girls are drawn to in fact i have been meaning to tell you i had a letter from your aunt julia saying that during her stay at biarritz they met a most charming american girl a miss schoonmaker whose father it seems used to be a friend of your uncle galahad she appeared to be quite taken with ronald and he with her he travelled back to paris with her and left her there how fickle men are sighed millicent she had some shopping to do said lady constance sharply by this time she is probably in london julia invited her to stay at blandings and she accepted she may be here any day now and i do think my dear proceeded lady constance earnestly that before she arrives you ought to consider very carefully what your feelings toward ronald really are you mean if i don t watch my step this miss doopenhacker may steal my ronnie away from me it was not quite how lady constance would have put it herself but it conveyed her meaning exactly millicent laughed it was plain that her flesh declined to creep at the prospect good luck to her she said she can count on a fish slice from me and i ll be a bridesmaid too if wanted can t you understand aunt constance that i haven t the slightest desire to marry ronnie we re great pals and all that but he s not my style too short for one thing short i m inches taller than he is when we went up the aisle i should look like someone taking her little brother for a walk lady constance would undoubtedly have commented on this remark but before she could do so the procession reappeared playing an unexpected return date footman james bore a dish of fruit footman thomas a salver with a cream jug on it beach as before confined himself to a straight ornamental r le oo said millicent welcomingly and the spaniel who liked anything involving cream gave a silent nod of approval well said lady constance as the procession withdrew giving up the lost cause if you won t marry ronald i suppose you won t that s about it agreed millicent pouring cream at any rate i am relieved to hear that there is no nonsense going on between you and this mr carmody that i could not have endured he s only moderately popular with you isn t he i dislike him extremely i wonder why i should have thought he was fairly all right as young men go uncle clarence likes him so does uncle gally lady constance had a high arched nose admirably adapted for sniffing she used it now to the limits of its power mr carmody she said is just the sort of young man your uncle galahad would like no doubt he reminds him of the horrible men he used to go about london with in his young days mr carmody isn t a bit like that indeed lady constance sniffed again well i dislike mentioning it to you millicent for i am old fashioned enough to think that young girls should be shielded from a knowledge of the world but i happen to know that mr carmody is not at all a nice young man i have it on the most excellent authority that he is entangled with some impossible chorus girl it is not easy to sit suddenly bolt upright in a deep garden chair but millicent managed the feat what lady allardyce told me so and how does she know her son vernon told her a girl of the name of brown vernon allardyce says that he used to see her repeatedly lunching and dining and dancing with mr carmody there was a long silence nice boy vernon said millicent he tells his mother everything that s what i meant i think it s so sweet of him millicent rose well i m going to take a short stroll she wandered off toward the rose garden iv a young man who has arranged to meet the girl he loves in the rose garden at six sharp naturally goes there at five twenty five so as not to be late hugo carmody had done this with the result that by three minutes to six he was feeling as if he had been marooned among roses since the beginning of the summer if anybody had told hugh carmody six months before that halfway through the following july he would be lurking in trysting places like this his whole being alert for the coming of a girl he would have scoffed at the idea he would have laughed lightly not that he had not been fond of girls he had always liked girls but they had been as it were the mere playthings so to speak of a financial giant s idle hour six months ago he had been the keen iron souled man of business all his energies and thoughts devoted to the management of the hot spot but now he stood shuffling his feet and starting hopefully at every sound while the leaden moments passed sluggishly on their way then his vigil was enlivened by a wasp which stung him on the back of the hand he was leaping to and fro licking his wounds when he perceived the girl of his dreams coming down the path ah cried hugo he ceased to leap and rushing forward would have clasped her in a fond embrace many people advocate the old fashioned blue bag for wasp stings but hugo preferred this treatment to his astonishment she drew back and she was not a girl who usually drew back on these occasions what s the matter he asked pained it seemed to him that a spanner had been bunged into a holy moment nothing hugo was concerned he did not like the way she was looking at him her soft blue eyes appeared to have been turned into stone i say he said i ve just been stung by a beastly great wasp good said millicent the way she was talking seemed to him worse than the way she was looking hugo s concern increased i say what s up the granite eye took on an added hardness you want to know what s up yes what s up i ll tell you what s up well what s up asked hugo he waited for enlightenment but she had fallen into a chilling silence you know said hugo breaking it i m getting pretty fed up with all this secrecy and general snakiness seeing you for an occasional odd five minutes a day and having to put on false whiskers and hide in bushes to manage that i know the keeble looks on me as a sort of cross between a leper and a nosegay of deadly nightshade but i m strong with the old boy i talk pig to him you might almost say i play on him as on a stringed instrument so what s wrong with going to him and telling him in a frank and manly way that we love each other and are going to get married the marble of millicent s face was disturbed by one of those quick sharp short bitter smiles that do nobody any good why should we lie to uncle clarence eh i say why should we tell him something that isn t true i don t get your drift i will continue snowing said millicent coldly i am not quite sure if i am ever going to speak to you again in this world or the next much will depend on how good you are as an explainer i have it on the most excellent authority that you are entangled with a chorus girl how about it hugo reeled but then st anthony himself would have reeled if a charge like that had suddenly been hurled at him the best of men require time to overhaul their consciences on such occasions a moment and he was himself again it s a lie name of brown not a word of truth in it i haven t set eyes on sue brown since i first met you no you ve been down here all the time and when i was setting eyes on her why dash it my attitude from start to finish was one of blameless innocent one hundred per cent brotherliness a wholesome friendship brotherly nothing more i liked dancing and she liked dancing and our steps fitted so occasionally we would go out together and tread the measure that s all there was to it pure brotherliness nothing more i looked on myself as a sort of brother brother eh absolutely a brother don t urged hugo earnestly go running away my dear old thing with any sort of silly notion that sue brown was something in the nature of a vamp she s one of the nicest girls you would ever want to meet nice is she a sweet girl a girl in a million a real good sort a sound egg pretty i suppose the native good sense of the carmodys asserted itself at the eleventh hour not pretty said hugo decidedly not pretty no not at all pretty far from pretty totally lacking in sex appeal poor girl but nice a good sort no nonsense about her sisterly millicent pondered h m she said nature paused listening birds checked their song insects their droning it was as if it had got about that this young man s fate hung in the balance and the returns would be in shortly well all right she said at length i suppose i ll have to believe you at s the way to talk but just you bear this in mind my lad any funny business from now on as if one more attack of that brotherly urge as though all right then hugo inhaled vigorously he felt like a man who has just dodged a wounded tigress banzai he said sweethearts still v blandings castle dozed in the twilight its various inmates were variously occupied clarence ninth earl of emsworth after many a longing lingering look behind had dragged himself away from the empress s boudoir and was reading his well thumbed copy of british pigs the hon galahad having fixed up the parsloe burper passage was skimming through his day s output with an artist s complacent feeling that this was the stuff to give em butler beach was pasting the hon galahad s photograph into his album millicent in her bedroom was looking a little thoughtfully into her mirror hugo in the billiard room was practising pensive cannons and thinking loving thoughts of his lady coupled with an occasional reflection that a short swift binge in london would be a great wheeze if he could wangle it and in her boudoir on the second floor lady constance keeble had taken pen in hand and was poising it over a sheet of notepaper dear mr baxter she wrote chapter ii i the brilliant sunshine which so enhanced the attractions of life at blandings castle had brought less pleasure to those of england s workers whose duties compelled them to remain in london in his offices on top of the regal theatre in shaftesbury avenue mr mortimer mason the stout senior partner in the firm of mason and saxby theatrical enterprises ltd was of opinion that what the country really needed was one of those wedge shaped depressions off the coast of iceland apart from making him feel like a gaffed salmon flaming july was ruining business only last night to cut down expenses he had had to dismiss some of the chorus from the show downstairs and he hated dismissing chorus girls he was a kind hearted man and having been in the profession himself in his time knew what it meant to get one s notice in the middle of the summer there was a tap on the door the human watchdog who guarded the outer offices entered well said mortimer mason wearily can you see miss brown sir which miss brown sue yes sir of course in spite of the heat mr mason brightened is she outside yes sir then pour her in mortimer mason had always felt a fatherly fondness for this girl sue brown he liked her for her own sake for her unvarying cheerfulness and the honest way she worked but what endeared her more particularly to him was the fact that she was dolly henderson s daughter london was full of elderly gentlemen who became pleasantly maudlin when they thought of dolly henderson and the dear old days when the heart was young and they had had waists he heaved himself from his chair then fell back again filled with a sense of intolerable injury my god he cried don t look so cool the rebuke was not undeserved on an afternoon when the asphalt is bubbling in the roadways and theatrical managers melting where they sit no girl has a right to resemble a dewy rose plucked from some old world garden and that mr mason considered was just what this girl was deliberately resembling she was a tiny thing mostly large eyes and a wide happy smile she had a dancer s figure and in every movement of her there was youth sorry pa she laughed and mr mason moaned faintly her laugh had reminded him for his was a nature not without its poetical side of ice tinkling in a jug of beer try not looking at me well sue what s on your mind come to tell me you re going to be married not at the moment i m afraid hasn t that young man of yours got back from biarritz yet he arrived this morning i had a note during the matin e i suppose he s outside now waiting for me want to have a look at him does it mean walking downstairs asked mr mason guardedly no he ll be in his car you can see him from the window mr mason was equal to getting to the window he peered down at the rakish sports model two seater in the little street below its occupant was lying on his spine smoking a cigarette in a long holder and looking austerely at certain children of the neighbourhood whom he seemed to suspect of being about to scratch his paint they re making fianc s very small this season said mr mason concluding his inspection he is small isn t he he s sensitive about it poor darling still i m small too so that s all right fond of him frightfully who is he anyway yes i know his name s fish and it doesn t mean a thing to me any money i believe he s got quite a lot only his uncle keeps it all lord emsworth he s ronnie s trustee or something emsworth i knew his brother years ago mr mason chuckled reminiscently old gally what a lad i ve got a scheme i d like to interest old gally in i wonder where he is now the prattler this week said he was down at blandings castle that s lord emsworth s place in shropshire ronnie s going down there this evening deserting you so soon mortimer mason shook his head i don t like this sue laughed well i don t said mr mason you be careful these lads will all bear watching don t worry pa he means to do right by our nell well don t say i didn t warn you so old gally is at blandings is he i must remember that i d like to get in touch with him and now what was it you wanted to see me about sue became grave i ve come to ask you a favour go ahead you know me it s about those girls you re getting rid of mr mason s genial face took on a managerial look got to get rid of them i know but one of them s sally field meaning what well sally s awfully hard up pa and what i came to ask said sue breathlessly was will you keep her on and let me go instead utter amazement caused mortimer mason momentarily to forget the heat he sat up gaping do what let me go instead let you go instead yes you re crazy no i m not come on pa be a dear is she a great friend of yours not particularly i m sorry for her i won t do it you must she s down to her last bean but i need you in the show what nonsense as if i made the slightest difference you do you ve got i don t know mr mason twiddled his fingers something your mother used to have it did you know i was the second juvenile in the first company she was ever in yes you told me and haven t you got on there s enough of you now to make two second juveniles well you will do it won t you mr mason reflected i suppose i ll have to if you insist he said at length if i don t you ll just hand your notice in anyway i know you you re a sportsman sue your mother was just the same but are you sure you ll manage all right i shan t be casting the new show till the end of august but i may be able to fix you up somewhere if i look round i don t see how you could look any rounder if you tried you poor darling do you realize pa that if you got up early every morning and did half an hour s swedish exercises if you don t want to be murdered stop it would do you all the good in the world you know well it s awfully sweet of you to bother about me pa but you mustn t you ve got enough to worry you already i shall be all right good bye you ve been an angel about sally it ll save her life if she s that cross eyed girl at the end of the second row who s always out of step i m not sure i want to save her life well you re going to do it anyway good bye don t run away i must ronnie s waiting he s going to take me to tea somewhere up the river i hope think how nice it will be there under the trees with the water rippling the only thing that stops me hitting you with this ruler said mr mason is the thought that i shall soon be getting out of this turkish bath myself i ve a show opening at the blackpool next week think how nice and cool it will be on the sands there with the waves splashing and you with your little spade and bucket paddling oh pa do send me a photograph well i can t stand here all day chatting over your vacation plans my poor darling ronnie must be getting slowly fried ii the process of getting slowly fried especially when you are chafing for a sight of the girl you love after six weeks of exile from her society is never an agreeable one after enduring it for some time the pink faced young man with the long cigarette holder had left his seat in the car and had gone for shade and comparative coolness to the shelter of the stage entrance where he now stood reading the notices on the call board he read them moodily the thought that after having been away from sue for all these weeks he was now compelled to leave her again and go to blandings castle was weighing on ronald overbury fish s mind sorely mac the guardian of the stage door leaned out of his hutch the matin e over he had begun to experience that solemn joy which comes to camels approaching an oasis and stage door men who will soon be at liberty to pop round the corner he endeavoured to communicate his happiness to ronnie won t be long now mr fish eh won t be long now sir ah said ronnie mac was concerned at his companion s gloom he liked smiling faces about him reflecting he fancied he could diagnose its cause i was sorry to hear about that mr fish eh i say i was sorry to hear about that sir about what about the hot spot sir that night club of yours busting up that way going west so prompt ronnie fish winced he presumed the man meant well but there are certain subjects one does not want mentioned when you have contrived with infinite pains to wheedle a portion of your capital out of a reluctant trustee and have gone and started a night club with it and have seen that night club flash into the receiver s hands like some frail eggshell engulfed by a whirlpool silence is best ah he said briefly to indicate this mac had many admirable qualities but not tact he was the sort of man who would have tried to cheer napoleon up by talking about the winter sports at moscow when i heard that you and mr carmody was starting one of those places i said to the fireman i give it two months i said and it was six weeks wasn t it sir seven six or seven immaterial which point is i m usually pretty right i said to the fireman it takes brains to run a night club i said brains and a certain what shall i say won me half a crown that did he searched in his mind for other topics to interest and amuse seen mr carmody lately sir no i ve been in biarritz he s down in shropshire he s got a job as secretary to an uncle of mine and i shouldn t wonder said mac cordially if he wouldn t make a mess of that he began to feel that the conversation was now going with a swing used to see a lot of mr carmody round here at one time the advance guard of the company appeared in the shape of a flock of musicians they passed out of the stage door first a couple of thirsty looking flutes then a group of violins finally an oboe by himself with a scowl on his face oboes are always savage in captivity yes sir came here a lot mr carmody did asking for miss brown great friends those two was oh said ronnie thickly used to make me laugh to see them together ronnie appeared to swallow something large and jagged why well him so tall and her so small but there said mac philosophically they say it s opposites that get on best i know i weigh seventeen stone and my missus looks like a ninepenny rabbit and yet we re as happy as can be ronnie s interest in the poundage of the stage door keeper s domestic circle was slight ah he said mac having got onto the subject of sue brown stayed there you see the flowers arrived all right sir eh the flowers you sent miss brown sir said mac indicating with a stubby thumb a bouquet on the shelf behind him i haven t given her them yet thought she d rather have them after the performance it was a handsome bouquet but ronnie fish stared at it with a sort of dumb horror his pink face had grown pinker and his eyes were glassy give me those flowers mac he said in a strangled voice right sir here you are sir now you look just like a bridegroom sir said the stage door keeper chuckling the sort of chuckle that goes with seventeen stone and a fat head this thought had struck ronnie also it was driven home a moment later by the displeasing behaviour of two of the chorus girls who came flitting past both looked at him in a way painful to a sensitive young man and one of them giggled ronnie turned to the door when miss brown comes tell her i m waiting outside in my car right sir you ll be in again i suppose sir no the sombre expression deepened on ronnie s face i ve got to go down to shropshire this evening be away long yes quite a time sorry to hear that sir well good bye sir thank you sir ronnie clutching the bouquet walked with leaden steps to the two seater there was a card attached to the flowers he read it frowned darkly and threw the bouquet into the car girls were passing now in shoals they meant nothing to ronnie fish he eyed them sourly marvelling why the papers talked about beauty choruses and then at last there appeared one at the sight of whom his heart parting from its moorings began to behave like a jumping bean it had reached his mouth when she ran up with both hands extended ronnie you precious angel lambkin sue to a young man in love however great the burden of sorrows beneath which he may be groaning the spectacle of the only girl in the world smiling up at him seldom fails to bring a temporary balm for the moment ronnie s gloom ceased to be he forgot that he had recently lost several hundred pounds in a disastrous commercial venture he forgot that he was going off that evening to live in exile he even forgot that this girl had just been sent a handsome bouquet by a ghastly bargee named p frobisher pilbeam belonging to the junior constitutional club these thoughts would return but for the time being the one that occupied his mind to the exclusion of all others was the thought that after six long weeks of separation he was once more looking upon sue brown i m so sorry i kept you waiting precious i had to see mr mason ronnie started what about a student of the motion pictures he knew what theatrical managers were just business did he ask you to lunch or anything no he just fired me fired you yes i ve lost my job said sue happily ronnie quivered i ll go and break his neck no you won t it isn t his fault it s the weather they have to cut down expenses when there s a heat wave it s all the fault of people like you for going abroad instead of staying in london and coming to the theatre she saw the flowers and uttered a delightful squeal for me a moment before ronnie had been all chivalrous concern a knight prepared to battle to the death for his lady love he now froze apparently he said coldly how do you mean apparently i mean they are you pet leap in ronnie s gloom was now dense and foglike once more he gestured fiercely at the clustering children and trod on the self starter the car moved smoothly round the corner into shaftesbury avenue opposite the monico there was a traffic block and he unloaded his soul in re those blooms they re lovely yes but i didn t send them you brought them much nicer what i m driving at said ronnie heavily is that they aren t from me at all they re from a blighter named p frobisher pilbeam sue s smile had faded she knew her ronald s jealousy so well it was the one thing about him which she could have wished changed oh she said dismally the crust of calm detachment from all human emotion built up by years of eton and cambridge cracked abruptly and there peeped forth a primitive ronald overbury fish who is this pilbeam he demanded pretty much the boy friend i take it what i ve never even met him but he sends you flowers i know he does wailed sue mourning for a golden afternoon now probably spoiled beyond repair he keeps sending me his beastly flowers and writing me his beastly letters ronnie gritted his teeth and i tell you i ve never set eyes on him in my life you don t know who he is one of the girls told me that he used to edit that paper society spice i don t know what he does now when he isn t sending you flowers you mean i can t help him sending me flowers i don t suppose you want to sue s eyes flickered realizing however that her ronnie in certain moods resembled a child of six she made a pathetic attempt to lighten the atmosphere it s not my fault if i get persecuted with loathsome addresses is it i suppose when you go to the movies you blame lillian gish for being pursued by the heavy ronnie was not to be diverted sometimes i ask myself he said darkly if you really care a hang for me oh ronnie yes i do repeatedly i look at you and i look at myself and that s what i ask myself what on earth is there about me to make a girl like you fond of a fellow i m a failure can t even run a night club no brains no looks you ve got a lovely complexion too pink much too pink and i m so damned short you re not a bit too short i am my uncle gally once told me i looked like the protoplasm of a minor jockey he ought to have been ashamed of himself why the dickens said ronnie laying bare his secret dreams i couldn t have been born a decent height like hugo he paused his hand shook on the steering wheel that reminds me that fellow mac at the stage door was saying that you and hugo used to be as thick as thieves always together he said sue sighed things were being difficult to day that was before i met you she explained patiently i used to like dancing with him he s a beautiful dancer you surely don t suppose for a minute that i could ever be in love with hugo i don t see why not hugo sue laughed there was something about hugo carmody that always made her want to laugh well i don t see why not he s better looking than i am taller not so pink plays the saxophone will you stop being silly about hugo well i fear that bird he s my best pal and i know his work he s practically handsome and lissom to boot a hideous thought smote ronnie like a blow did he ever he choked did he ever hold your hand which hand either hand how can you suggest such a thing cried sue shocked well will you swear there s nothing between him and you of course there isn t and nothing between this fellow pilbeam and you of course not ah said ronnie then i can go ahead as planned his was a mercurial temperament and it had lifted him in an instant from the depths to the heights the cloud had passed from his face the look of byronic despair from his eyes he beamed do you know why i m going down to blandings to night he asked no i only wish you weren t well i ll tell you i ve got to get round my uncle do what make myself solid with my uncle clarence if you ve ever had anything to do with trustees you ll know that the one thing they bar like poison is parting with money and i ve simply got to have another chunk of my capital and a good big one too without money how on earth can i marry you let me get hold of funds and we ll dash off to the registrar s the moment you say the word so now you understand why i ve got to get to blandings at the earliest possible moment and stay there till further notice yes i see and you re a darling tell me about blandings ronnie how do you mean well what sort of a place is it i want to imagine you there while you re away ronnie pondered he was not at his best as a word painter oh you know the kind of thing parks and gardens and terraces and immemorial elms and all that all the usual stuff any girls there my cousin millicent she s my uncle lancelot s daughter he s dead the family want millicent and me to get married to each other you mean what a perfectly horrible idea oh it s all right we re both against the scheme well that s some comfort what other girls will there be at blandings only one that i know of my mother met a female called schoonmaker at biarritz american pots of money i believe one of those beastly tall girls looked like something left over from dana gibson i couldn t stand her myself but my mother was all for her and i didn t at all like the way she seemed to be trying to shove her off onto me you know why don t you ring up myra schoonmaker ronnie i m sure she would like to go to the casino to night and then you could dance afterward sinister it seemed to me and she s going to blandings h m there s nothing to h m about i m not so sure oh well i suppose your family are quite right i suppose you ought really to marry some nice girl in your own set ronnie uttered a wordless cry and in his emotion allowed the mudguard of the two seater to glide so closely past an austin seven that sue gave a frightened squeak and the austin seven went on its way thinking black thoughts do be careful ronnie you old chump well what do you want to go saying things like that for i get enough of that from the family without having you start poor old ronnie i m sorry still you must admit that they d be quite within their rights objecting to me i m not so hot you know only a chorus girl just one of the ensemble ronnie said something between his teeth that sounded like juk what he meant was be her station never so humble a pure sweet girl is a fitting mate for the highest in the land and my mother was a music hall singer a what a music hall singer what they used to call a serio you know pink tights and rather risky songs this time ronnie did not say juk he merely swallowed painfully the information had come as a shock to him somehow or other he had never thought of sue as having encumbrances in the shape of relatives and he could not hide from himself the fact that a pink tighted serio might stir the family up quite a little he pictured something with peroxide hair who would call his uncle clarence dearie english do you mean on the halls here in london yes her stage name was dolly henderson never heard of her i dare say not but she was the rage of london twenty years ago i always thought you were american said ronnie aggrieved i distinctly recollect hugo when he introduced us telling me that you had just come over from new york so i had father took me to america soon after mother died oh your mother is er no longer with us no too bad said ronnie brightening my father s name was cotterleigh he was in the irish guards what ronnie s ecstatic cry seriously inconvenienced a traffic policeman in the exercise of his duties but this is fine this is the goods it doesn t matter to me of course one way or the other i d love you just the same if your father had sold jellied eels but think what an enormous difference this will make to my blasted family i doubt it but it will we must get him over at once and spring him on them or is he in london sue s brown eyes clouded he s dead eh oh sorry said ronnie he was dashed for a moment well at least let me tell the family about him he urged recovering let me dangle him before their eyes a bit if you like but they ll still object to me because i m in the chorus ronnie scowled he thought of his mother he thought of his aunt constance and reason told him that her words were true dash all this rot people talk about chorus girls he said they seem to think that just because a girl works in the chorus she must be a sort of animated champagne vat ugh spending her life dancing on supper tables with tight stockbrokers and not a bad way of passing an evening said sue meditatively i must try it some time with the result that when it s a question of her marrying anybody fellow s people look down their noses and kick like mules it s happened in our family before my uncle gally was in love with some girl on the stage back in the dark ages and they formed a wedge and bust the thing up and shipped him off to south africa or somewhere to forget her and look at him drew three sober breaths in the year nineteen hundred and then decided that was enough i expect i shall be the same if i don t take to drink cooped up at blandings a hundred miles away from you i shall be vastly surprised it s all a lot of silly nonsense i haven t any patience with it i ve a jolly good mind to go to uncle clarence to night and simply tell him that i m in love with you and intend to marry you and that if the family don t like it they can lump it i wouldn t ronnie simmered down perhaps you re right i m sure i am if he hears about me he certainly won t give you your money whereas if he doesn t he may what sort of a man is he uncle clarence oh a mild dreamy old boy mad about gardening and all that at the moment i hear he s wrapped up in his pig that sounds cosy i d feel a lot easier in my mind i can tell you going down there to tackle him if i were a pig i d expect a much warmer welcome you were rather a pig just now weren t you ronnie quivered remorse gnawed the throbbing heart beneath his beautifully cut waistcoat i m sorry i m frightfully sorry the fact is i m so crazy about you i get jealous of everybody you meet do you know sue if you ever let me down i d i don t know what i d do er sue hullo swear something what swear that while i m at blandings you won t go out with a soul not even to dance not even to dance no all right especially this man pilbeam i thought you were going to say hugo i m not worrying about hugo he s safe at blandings hugo at blandings yes he s secretarying for my uncle clarence i made my mother get him the job when the hot spot conked so you ll have him and millicent and miss schoonmaker there to keep you company how nice for you millicent it s all very well to say millicent like that if you ask me i think she s a menace she sounds coy and droopy i can see her taking you for walks by moonlight under those immemorial elms and looking up at you with big dreamy eyes looking down at me you mean she s about a foot taller than i am and anyway if you imagine there s a girl on earth who could extract so much as a kindly glance from me when i ve got you to think about you re very much mistaken i give you my honest word he became lyrical sue leaning back listened contentedly the cloud had been a threatening cloud blackening the skies for a while but it had passed the afternoon was being golden after all iii by the way said ronnie the flood of eloquence subsiding a thought occurs have you any notion where we re headed for heaven i mean at the moment i supposed you were taking me to tea somewhere but where we ve got right out of the tea zone what with one thing and another i ve just been driving at random to and fro as it were and we seem to have worked round to somewhere in the swiss cottage neighbourhood we d better switch back and set a course for the carlton or some place how do you feel about the carlton all right or the ritz whichever you like or gosh what s the matter sue i ve got an idea beginner s luck why not go to norfolk street to your home yes there s nobody there and our butler is a staunch bird he ll get us tea and say nothing i d like to meet a staunch butler then shall we i d love it you can show me all your little treasures and belongings and the photographs of you as a small boy ronnie shook his head it irked him to discourage her pretty enthusiasm but a man can not afford to take risks not those no love could stand up against the sight of me in a sailor suit at the age of ten i don t mind he said making a concession letting you see the one of me and hugo taken just before the public schools rackets competition my last year at school we were the eton pair did you win no at a critical moment in the semifinal that ass hugo foozled a shot a one armed cripple ought to have taken with his eyes shut it dished us awful said sue well if i ever had any impulse to love hugo that s killed it she looked about her i don t know this aristocratic neighbourhood at all how far is it to norfolk street next turning you re sure there s nobody in the house none of the dear old family not a soul he was right lady constance keeble was not actually in the house at the moment when he spoke she had just closed the front door behind her after waiting half an hour in the hope of her nephew s return she had left a note for him on the hall table and was going to claridge s to get a cup of tea it was not until he had drawn up immediately opposite the house that ronnie perceived what stood upon the steps having done so he blanched visibly oh my sainted aunt he said and seldom can the familiar phrase have been used with more appropriateness the sainted aunt was inspecting the two seater and its contents with a frozen stare her eyebrows were two marks of interrogation as she had told millicent she was old fashioned and when she saw her flesh and blood snuggled up to girls of attractive appearance in two seaters she suspected the worst good afternoon ronald er hullo aunt constance will you introduce me there is no doubt that peril sharpens the intellect his masters at school and his tutors at the university having had to do with ronald overbury fish almost entirely at times when his soul was at rest had classed him among the less keen witted of their charges had they seen him now in this crisis they would have pointed at him with pride and being the sportsmen and gentlemen that they were they would have hastened to acknowledge that they had grossly underestimated his ingenuity and initiative for after turning a rather pretty geranium tint and running a finger round the inside of his collar for an instant as if he found it too tight ronnie fish spoke the only two words in the language which could have averted disaster miss schoonmaker he said huskily sue at his side gave a little gasp these were unsuspected depths miss schoonmaker lady constance s resemblance to apollyon straddling right across the way had vanished abruptly remorse came upon her that she should have wronged her blameless nephew with unfounded suspicion miss schoonmaker my aunt lady constance keeble said ronnie going from strength to strength and speaking now quite easily and articulately sue was not the girl to sit dumbly by and fail a partner in his hour of need she smiled brightly how do you do lady constance she said she smiled again if possible even more brightly than before i feel i know you already lady julia told me so much about you at biarritz a momentary qualm lest in the endeavour to achieve an easy cordiality she had made her manner a shade too patronizing melted in the sunshine of the older woman s smile lady constance had become charming almost effusive she had always hoped that ronald and millicent would make a match of it but failing that this rich miss schoonmaker was certainly the next best thing and driving chummily about london together like this must surely she thought mean something even in these days when chummy driving is so prevalent between the sexes at any rate she hoped so so here you are in london yes you did not stay long in paris no when can you come down to blandings oh very soon i hope i am going there this evening i only ran up for the day i want you to drive me back ronald ronnie nodded silently the crisis passed a weakness had come upon him he preferred not to speak if speech could be avoided do try to come soon the gardens are looking delightful my brother will be so glad to see you i was just on my way to claridge s for a cup of tea won t you come too i d love to said sue but i really must be getting on ronnie was taking me shopping i thought you stayed in paris to do your shopping not all of it well i shall hope to see you soon oh yes at blandings thank you so much ronnie i think we ought to be getting along yes ronnie s mind was blurred but he was clear on that point yes getting along pushing off well i m so delighted to have seen you my sister told me so much about you in her letters after you have put your luggage on the car ronald will you come and pick me up at claridge s right ho i would like to make an early start if possible right ho well good bye for the present then right ho good bye lady constance good bye the two seater moved off and ronnie taking his right hand from the wheel as it turned the corner groped for a handkerchief found it and passed it over his throbbing brow so that was aunt constance said sue ronnie breathed deeply nice meeting one of whom i have heard so much ronnie replaced his hand on the wheel and twiddled it feebly to avoid a dog reaction had made him limp sue was gazing at him almost reverently what genius ronnie what ready wit what presence of mind if i hadn t heard it with my own ears i wouldn t have believed it why didn t you ever tell me you were one of those swift thinkers i didn t know it myself of course i m afraid it has complicated things a little eh ronnie started this aspect of the matter had not struck him how do you mean when i was a child they taught me a poem ronnie raised a suffering face to hers don t let s talk about your childhood now old thing he pleaded feeling rather shaken any other time it s all right i m not wandering from the subject i can only remember two lines of the poem they were oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practise to deceive you do see the web is a bit tangled don t you ronnie darling eh why everything looks pretty smooth to me aunt constance swallowed you without a yip and when the real miss schoonmaker arrives at blandings with her jewels and her twenty four trunks said sue gently the two seater swerved madly across grosvenor street gosh said ronnie sue s eyes were sparkling there s only one thing to do she said now you re in you ll have to go in deeper you ll have to put her off how send her a wire saying she mustn t come to blandings because scarlet fever or something has broken out i couldn t you must sign it in lady constance s name but suppose well suppose they do find out you won t be in any worse hole than you will be if she comes sailing up to the front door all ready to stay a couple of weeks and she will unless you wire that s true what it means said sue is that instead of having plenty of time to get that money out of lord emsworth you ll have to work quick she touched his arm here s a post office she said go in and send that wire before you weaken ronnie stopped the car you will have to do the most rapid bit of trustee touching in the history of the world i should think said sue reflectively do you think you can manage it i ll have a jolly good prod remember what it means i ll do that all right the only trouble is that in the matter of biting uncle clarence s ear i ve nothing to rely on but my natural charm and as far as i ve been able to make out said ronnie he hasn t noticed yet that i have any he strode into the post office thinking deeply chapter iii i it was the opinion of the poet calverley expressed in his immortal ode to tobacco that there is no heaviness of the soul which will not vanish beneath the influence of a quiet smoke ronnie fish would have disputed this theory it was the third morning of his sojourn at blandings castle and taking with him a tennis ball which he proposed to bounce before him in order to assist thought he had wandered out into the grounds smoking hard and tobacco though turkish and costly was not lightening his despondency at all it seemed to ronnie that the present was bleak and the future gray roaming through the sun flooded park he bounced his tennis ball and groaned in spirit on the credit side of the ledger one single item could be inscribed hugo was at the castle he had the consolation therefore of knowing that that tall and lissom young man was not in london exercising his fatal fascination on sue but when you had said this you had said everything after all even eliminating hugo there still remained in the metropolis a vast population of adult males all either acquainted with sue or trying to make her acquaintance the poison sac pilbeam for instance by now it might well be that that bacillus had succeeded in obtaining an introduction to her a devastating thought and even supposing he hadn t even supposing that sue as she had promised was virtuously handing the mitten to all the young thugs who surged around her with invitations to lunch and supper where did that get a chap what in other words of the future in coming to blandings castle ronnie was only too well aware he had embarked on an expedition the success or failure of which would determine whether his life through the years was to be roses roses all the way or a dreary desert and so far in his efforts to win the favour and esteem of his uncle clarence he seemed to have made no progress whatsoever on the occasions when he had found himself in lord emsworth s society the latter had looked at him sometimes as if he did not know he was there more often as if he wished he wasn t it was only too plain that the collapse of the hot spot had left his stock in bad shape there had been a general sagging of the market fish preferred taking the most sanguine estimate could scarcely be quoted at more than about thirty to thirty five plunged in thought and trying without any success to conjure up a picture of a benevolent uncle patting him on the head with one hand while writing checks with the other he had wandered some distance from the house and was passing a small spinney when he observed in a little dell to his left a peculiar object it was a large yellow caravan and what he asked himself was a caravan doing in the grounds of blandings castle to aid him in grappling with the problem he flung the tennis ball at it upon which the door opened and a spectacled head appeared hullo said the head hullo said ronnie hullo hullo the thing threatened to become a hunting chorus at this moment however the sun went behind a cloud and ronnie was enabled to recognize the head s proprietor until now the light shining on the other s glasses had dazzled him baxter he exclaimed the last person he would have expected to meet in the park of blandings he had heard all about that row a couple of years ago he knew that if his own stock with lord emsworth was low that of the efficient baxter was down in the cellar with no takers yet here the fellow was shoving his head out of caravans as if nothing had happened ah fish rupert baxter descended the steps a swarthy complexioned young man with a supercilious expression which had always been displeasing to ronnie what are you doing here asked ronnie i happened to be taking a caravan holiday in the neighbourhood and finding myself at market blandings last night i thought i would pay a visit to the place where i had spent so many happy days i see perhaps you could tell me where i could find lady constance i haven t seen her since breakfast she s probably about somewhere i will go and inquire if you meet her perhaps you would not mind mentioning that i am here the efficient baxter strode off purposeful as ever and ronnie having speculated for a moment as to how his uncle clarence would comport himself if he came suddenly round a corner and ran into this bit of the dead past and having registered an idle hope that when this happened he might be present with a camera inserted another cigarette in its holder and passed on his way ii five minutes later lord emsworth leaning pensively out of the library window and sniffing the morning air received an unpleasant shock he could have sworn he had seen his late secretary rupert baxter cross the gravel and go in at the front door bless my soul said lord emsworth the only explanation that occurred to him was that baxter having met with some fatal accident had come back to haunt the place to suppose the fellow could be here in person was absurd when you shoot a secretary out for throwing flower pots at you in the small hours he does not return to pay social calls a frown furrowed his lordship s brow the spectre of one of his ancestors he could have put up with but the idea of a blandings castle haunted by baxter he did not relish at all he decided to visit his sister constance in her boudoir and see what she had to say about it constance my dear lady constance looked up from the letter she was writing she clicked her tongue for it annoyed her to be interrupted at her correspondence well clarence i say constance a most extraordinary thing happened just now i was looking out of the library window and you remember baxter of course i remember mr baxter well his ghost has just walked across the gravel what are you talking about clarence i m telling you i was looking out of the library window and i suddenly saw mr baxter announced beach flinging open the door mr baxter good morning lady constance rupert baxter advanced with joyous camaraderie glinting from both lenses then he perceived his former employer and his exuberance diminished er good morning lord emsworth he said flashing his spectacles austerely upon him there was a pause lord emsworth adjusted his pince nez and regarded the visitor dumbly of the relief which was presumably flooding his soul at the discovery that rupert baxter was still on this side of the veil he gave no outward sign baxter was the first to break an uncomfortable silence i happened to be taking a caravan holiday in this neighbourhood lady constance and finding myself near market blandings last night i thought i would why of course we should never have forgiven you if you had not come to see us should we clarence eh i said should we should we what said lord emsworth who was still adjusting his mind lady constance s lips tightened and a moment passed during which it seemed always a fifty fifty chance that a handsome silver ink pot would fly through the air in the direction of her brother s head but she was a strong woman she fought down the impulse did you say you were travelling in a caravan mr baxter in a caravan i left it in the park well of course you must come and stay with us the castle she continued raising her voice a little to compete with a sort of wordless bubbling which had begun to proceed from her brother s lips is almost empty just now we shall not be having our first big house party till the middle of next month you must make quite a long visit i will send somebody over to fetch your things it is exceedingly kind of you it will be delightful having you here again won t it clarence eh i said won t it won t it what lady constance s hand trembled above the ink pot like a hovering butterfly she withdrew it will it not be delightful she said catching her brother s eye and holding it like a female ancient mariner having mr baxter back at the castle again i m going down to see my pig said lord emsworth a silence followed his departure such as would have fallen had a coffin just been carried out then lady constance shook off gloom oh mr baxter i m so glad you were able to come and how clever of you to come in a caravan it prevented your arrival seeming prearranged i thought of that you think of everything rupert baxter stepped to the door opened it satisfied himself that no listeners lurked in the passage and returned to his seat are you in any trouble lady constance your letter seemed so very urgent i am in dreadful trouble mr baxter if rupert baxter had been a different type of man and lady constance keeble a different type of woman he would probably at this point have patted her hand as it was he merely hitched his chair an inch closer to hers if there is anything i can do there is nobody except you who can do anything but i hardly like to ask you ask me whatever you please and if it is in my power oh it is rupert baxter gave his chair another hitch tell me lady constance hesitated it seems such an impossible thing to ask of anyone please well you know my brother baxter seemed puzzled then an explanation of the peculiar question presented itself oh you mean mr yes yes yes of course i wasn t referring to lord emsworth my brother galahad i have met him oddly enough though he visited the castle twice during the period when i was lord emsworth s secretary i was away both times on my holiday is he here now yes finishing his reminiscences i saw in some paper that he was writing the history of his life and if you know what a life his has been you will understand why i am distracted certainly i have heard stories said baxter guardedly lady constance performed that movement with her hands which came so close to wringing the book is full from beginning to end of libellous anecdotes mr baxter about all our best friends if it is published we shall not have a friend left galahad seems to have known everybody in england when they were young and foolish and to remember everything particularly foolish and disgraceful that they did so so you want me to get hold of the manuscript and destroy it lady constance stared stunned by this penetration she told herself that she might have known that she would not have to make long explanations to rupert baxter his mind was like a searchlight darting hither and thither lighting up whatever it touched yes she gasped she hurried on it does seem i know an extraordinary thing to not at all but lord emsworth refuses to do anything i see you know how he is in the face of any emergency yes i do indeed so supine so helpless so vague and altogether incompetent precisely mr baxter you are my only hope baxter removed his spectacles polished them and put them back again i shall be delighted lady constance to do anything to help you that lies in my power and to obtain possession of this manuscript should be an easy task but is there only one copy of it in existence yes yes yes i am sure of that galahad told me that he was waiting till it was finished before sending it to the typist then you need have no further anxiety it was a moment when lady constance keeble would have given much for eloquence she sought for words that should adequately express her feelings but could find none oh mr baxter she said ronnie fish s aimlessly wandering feet had taken him westward it was not long accordingly before there came to his nostrils a familiar and penetrating odour and he found that he was within a short distance of the detached residence employed by empress of blandings as a combined bedroom and restaurant a few steps and he was enabled to observe that celebrated animal in person with her head tucked well down and her tail wiggling with pure joie de vivre the empress was hoisting in a spot of lunch everybody likes to see somebody eating ronnie leaned over the rail absorbed he poised the tennis ball and with an absent minded flick of the wrist bounced it on the silver medallist s back finding the pleasant ponging sound which resulted soothing to harassed nerves he did it again the empress made excellent bouncing she was not one of your razor backs she presented a wide and resistant surface for some minutes therefore the pair carried on according to plan she eating he bouncing until presently ronnie was thrilled to discover that this outdoor sport of his was assisting thought gradually mistily at first then assuming shape a plan of action was beginning to emerge from the murk of his mind how would this be for instance if there was one thing calculated to appeal to his uncle clarence to induce in his uncle clarence a really melting mood it was the announcement that somebody desired to return to the land he loved to hear of people returning to the land how then would this be go to the old boy state that one had seen the light and was in complete agreement with him that england s future depended on checking the drift to the towns and then ask for a good fat slice of capital with which to start a farm the project of starting a farm was one which was bound to half a minute another idea on the way yes here it came and it was a pippin not merely just an ordinary farm but a pig farm wouldn t uncle clarence leap in the air and shower gold on anybody who wanted to live in the country and breed pigs you bet your sunday cuffs he would and once the money was safely deposited to the account of ronald overbury fish in cox s bank then ho for the registrar s hand in hand with sue there was a musical plonk as ronnie bounced the ball for the last time on the empress s complacent back then no longer with dragging steps but treading on air he wandered away to sketch out the last details of the scheme before going indoors and springing it iii too often it happens that when you get these brain waves you take another look at them after a short interval and suddenly detect some fatal flaw no such disappointment came to mar the happiness of ronnie fish i say uncle clarence he said prancing into the library some half hour later lord emsworth was deep in the current issue of a weekly paper of porcine interest it seemed to ronnie as he looked up that his eye was not any too chummy this however did not disturb him that eye he was confident would melt anon if at the moment lord emsworth could hardly have sat for his portrait in the r le of a benevolent uncle there would ronnie felt be a swift change of demeanour in the very near future i say uncle clarence you know that capital of mine that what my capital my money the money you re trustee of and a jolly good trustee said ronnie handsomely well i ve been thinking things over and i want you if you will to disgorge a segment of it for a sort of venture i ve got in mind he had not expected the eye to melt yet and it did not seen through the glass of his uncle s pince nez it looked like an oyster in an aquarium you wish to start another night club lord emsworth s voice was cold and ronnie hastened to disabuse him of the idea no no nothing like that night clubs are a mug s game i ought never to have touched them as a matter of fact uncle clarence london as a whole seems to me a bit of a washout these days i m all for the country what i feel is that the drift to the towns should be checked what england wants is more blokes going back to the land that s the way it looks to me ronnie fish began to experience the first definite twinges of uneasiness this was the point at which he had been confident that the melting process would set in yet watching the eye he was dismayed to find it as oysterlike as ever he felt like an actor who has been counting on a round of applause and goes off after his big speech without a hand the idea occurred to him that his uncle might possibly have grown a little hard of hearing to the land he repeated raising his voice more blokes going back to the land so i want a dollop of capital to start a farm he braced himself for the supreme revelation i want to breed pigs he said reverently something was wrong there was no blinking the fact any longer so far from leaping in the air and showering gold his uncle merely stared at him in an increasingly unpleasant manner lord emsworth had removed his pince nez and was wiping them and ronnie thought that his eye looked rather less agreeable in the nude than it had done through glass pigs he cried fighting against a growing alarm pigs pigs you wish to breed pigs that s right bellowed ronnie pigs and from somewhere in his system he contrived to dig up and fasten on his face an ingratiating smile lord emsworth replaced his pince nez and i suppose he said throatily quivering from his head to his roomy shoes that when you ve got em you ll spend the whole day bouncing tennis balls on their backs ronnie gulped the shock had been severe the ingratiating smile lingered on his lips as if fastened there with pins but his eyes were round and horrified eh he said feebly lord emsworth rose so long as he insisted on wearing an old shooting jacket with holes in the elbows and letting his tie slip down and show the head of a brass stud he could never hope to be completely satisfactory as a figure of outraged majesty but he achieved as imposing an effect as his upholstery would permit he drew himself up to his full height which was considerable and from this eminence glared balefully down on his nephew i saw you i was on my way to the piggery and i saw you bouncing your infernal tennis balls on my pig s back tennis balls fire seemed to stream from the pince nez are you aware that empress of blandings is an excessively nervous highly strung animal only too ready on the lightest provocation to refuse her meals you might have undone the work of months with your idiotic tennis ball i m sorry what s the good of being sorry i never thought you never do that s what s the trouble with you pig farm said lord emsworth vehemently his voice soaring into the upper register you couldn t manage a pig farm you aren t fit to manage a pig farm you aren t worthy to manage a pig farm if i had to select somebody out of the whole world to manage a pig farm i would choose you last ronnie fish groped his way to the table and supported himself on it he had a sensation of dizziness on one point he was reasonably clear viz that his uncle clarence did not consider him ideally fitted to manage a pig farm but apart from that his mind was in a whirl he felt as if he had stepped on something and it had gone off with a bang here what is all this it was the hon galahad who had spoken and he had spoken peevishly working in the small library with the door ajar he had found the babble of voices interfering with literary composition and justifiably annoyed had come to investigate can t you do your reciting some time when i m not working clarence he said what s all the trouble about lord emsworth was still full of his grievance he bounced tennis balls on my pig the hon galahad was not impressed he did not register horror do you mean to tell me he said sternly that all this fuss ruining my morning s work was simply about that blasted pig of yours i refuse to allow you to call the empress a blasted pig good heavens cried lord emsworth passionately can none of my family appreciate the fact that she is the most remarkable animal in great britain no pig in the whole annals of the shropshire agricultural show has ever won the silver medal two years in succession and that if only people will leave her alone and refrain from incessantly pelting her with tennis balls is what the empress is quite certain to do it is an unheard of feat the hon galahad frowned he shook his head reprovingly it was all very well he felt a stable being optimistic about its nominee but he was a man who could face facts in a long and checkered life he had seen so many good things unstuck besides he had his superstitions and one of them was that counting your chickens in advance brought bad luck don t be too cocksure my boy he said gravely i looked in at the emsworth arms the other day for a glass of beer and there was a fellow in there offering three to one on an animal called pride of matchingham offering it freely tall red haired fellow with a squint slightly bottled lord emsworth forgot ronnie forgot tennis balls forgot in the shock of this announcement everything except that deeper wrong which so long had been poisoning his peace pride of matchingham belongs to sir gregory parsloe he said and i have no doubt that the man offering such ridiculous odds was his pig man wellbeloved as you know the fellow used to be in my employment but parsloe lured him away from me by the promise of higher wages lord emsworth s expression had now become positively ferocious the thought of george cyril wellbeloved that perjured pig man always made the iron enter into his soul it was a most abominable and unneighbourly thing to do the hon galahad whistled so that s it is it parsloe s pig man going about offering three to one against the form book i take it most decidedly pride of matchingham was awarded second prize last year but it is a quite inferior animal to the empress then you look after that pig of yours clarence the hon galahad spoke earnestly i see what this means parsloe s up to his old games and intends to queer the empress somehow queer her nobble her or if he can t do that steal her you don t mean that i do mean it the man s as slippery as a greased eel he would nobble his grandmother if it suited his book let me tell you i ve known young parsloe for thirty years and i solemnly state that if his grandmother was entered in a competition for fat pigs and his commitments made it desirable for him to get her out of the way he would dope her bran mash and acorns without a moment s hesitation god bless my soul said lord emsworth deeply impressed let me tell you a little story about young parsloe one or two of us used to meet at the black footman in gossiter street in the old days they ve pulled it down now and match our dogs against rats in the room behind the bar well i put my towser an admirable beast up against young parsloe s banjo on one occasion for a hundred pounds a side and when the night came and he was shown the rats i m dashed if he didn t just give a long yawn and roll over and go to sleep i whistled him called him towser towser no good fast asleep and my firm belief has always been that young parsloe took him aside just before the contest was to start and gave him about six pounds of steak and onions couldn t prove anything of course but i sniffed the dog s breath and it was like opening the kitchen door of a soho chophouse on a summer night that s the sort of man young parsloe is galahad fact you ll find the story in my book lord emsworth was tottering to the door god bless my soul i never realized i must see pirbright at once i didn t suspect it never occurred the door closed behind him the hon galahad preparing to return to his labours was arrested by the voice of his nephew ronald uncle gally the young man s pink face had flamed to a bright crimson his eyes gleamed strangely well you don t really think sir gregory will try to steal the empress i certainly do known him for thirty years i tell you but how could he go to her sty at night of course and take her away and hide her somewhere yes but an animal of that size rather like looking in at the zoo and pocketing one of the elephants what don t talk like an idiot she s got a ring through her nose hasn t she you mean sir gregory would catch hold of the ring and she would breeze along quite calmly certainly puffy benger and i stole old wivenhoe s pig the night of the bachelors ball at hammers easton in the year we put it in plug basham s bedroom there was no difficulty about the thing whatsoever a little child could have led it he withdrew into the small library and ronnie slid limply into the chair which lord emsworth had risen from so majestically he felt the need of sitting the inspiration which had just come to him had had a stunning effect the brilliance of it almost frightened him that idea about starting a pig farm had shown that this was one of his bright mornings but he had never foreseen that he would be as bright as this golly said ronnie could he well why not suppose no the thing was impossible was it why why was it impossible suppose he had a stab at it suppose following his uncle galahad s expert hints he were to creep out to night abstract the empress from her home hide her somewhere for a day or two and then spectacularly restore her to her bereaved owner what would be the result would uncle clarence sob on his neck or would he not would he feel that no reward was too good for his benefactor or wouldn t he most decidedly he would fish preferred would soar immediately that little matter of the advance of capital would solve itself money would stream automatically from the emsworth coffers but could it be done ronnie forced himself to examine the scheme dispassionately with a mind alert for snags he could detect none a suitable hiding place occurred to him immediately that disused gamekeeper s cottage in the west wood nobody ever went there it would be as good as a safe deposit risk of detection why should there be any risk of detection who would think of connecting ronald fish with the affair feeding the animal ronnie s face clouded yes here at last was the snag this did present difficulties he was vague as to what pigs ate but he knew that they needed a lot of whatever it was it would be no use restoring to lord emsworth a skeleton empress the cuisine must be maintained at its existing level or the thing might just as well be left undone for the first time he began to doubt the quality of his recent inspiration scanning the desk with knitted brows he took from the book rest the volume entitled pigs and how to make them pay a glance at page and his misgivings were confirmed myes said ronnie having skimmed through all the stuff about barley meal and maize meal and linseed meal and potatoes and separated milk or buttermilk this he now saw clearly was no one man job it called not only for a dashing principal but a zealous assistant and what assistant hugo no in many respects the ideal accomplice for an undertaking of this nature hugo carmody had certain defects that automatically disqualified him to enrol hugo as his lieutenant would mean revealing to him the motives that lay at the back of the venture and if hugo knew that he ronnie was endeavouring to collect funds in order to get married the thing would be all over shropshire in a couple of days short of putting it on the front page of the daily mail or having it broadcast over the wireless the surest way of obtaining publicity for anything you wanted kept dark was to confide it to hugo carmody a splendid chap but the real genuine human colander no not hugo then who ah ronnie fish sprang from his chair threw his head back and uttered a yodel of joy so loud and penetrating that the door of the small library flew open as if he had touched a spring a tousled literary man emerged stop that damned noise how the devil can i write with a row like that going on sorry uncle i was just thinking of something well think of something else how do you spell intoxicated one x thanks said the hon galahad and vanished again iv in his pantry in shirt sleeved ease beach the butler sat taking the well earned rest of a man whose silver is all done and who has no further duties to perform till lunch time a bullfinch sang gaily in a cage on the window sill but it did not disturb him for he was absorbed in the racing intelligence page of the morning post suddenly he rose palpitating a sharp rap had sounded on the door and he was a man who reacted nervously to sudden noises there entered his employer s nephew mr ronald fish hullo beach sir busy no sir just thought i d look in yes sir for a chat very good sir although the butler spoke with his usual smooth courtesy he was far from feeling easy in his mind he did not like ronnie s looks it seemed to him that his young visitor was feverish the limbs twitched the eyes gleamed the blood pressure appeared heightened and there was a supernormal pinkness in the epidermis of the cheek long time since we had a cosy talk beach yes sir when i was a kid i used to be in and out of this pantry of yours all day long yes sir a mood of extreme sentimentality now appeared to grip the young man he sighed like a centenarian recalling far off happy things those were the days beach yes sir no problems then no worries and even if i had worries i could always bring them to you couldn t i yes sir remember the time i hid in here when my uncle gally was after me with a whangee for putting tin tacks on his chair yes sir it was a close call but you saved me you were staunch and true a man in a million i ve always thought that if there were more people like you in the world it would be a better place i do my best to give satisfaction sir and how you succeed i shall never forget your kindness in those dear old days beach extremely good of you to say so sir later as the years went by i did my best to repay you by sharing with you such snips as came my way remember the time i gave you blackbird for the manchester november handicap yes sir you collected a packet it did prove a remarkably sound investment sir yes and so it went on i look back through the years and i seem to see you and me standing side by side each helping each each doing the square thing by the other you certainly always did the square thing by me i trust i shall always continue to do so sir i know you will beach it isn t in you to do otherwise and that said ronnie beaming on him lovingly is why i feel so sure that when i have stolen my uncle s pig you will be there helping to feed it till i give it back the butler s was not a face that registered nimbly it took some time for a look of utter astonishment to cover its full acreage such a look had spread to perhaps two thirds of its surface when ronnie went on you see beach strictly between ourselves i have made up my mind to sneak the empress away and keep her hidden in that gamekeeper s cottage in the west wood and then when uncle clarence is sending out s o s s and offering large rewards i shall find it there and return it thus winning his undying gratitude and putting him in the right frame of mind to yield up a bit of my money that i want to get out of him you get the idea the butler blinked he was plainly endeavouring to conquer a suspicion that his mind was darkening ronnie nodded kindly at him as he fought for speech it s the scheme of a lifetime you were going to say you re quite right it is but it s one of these schemes that call for a sympathetic fellow worker you see pigs like the empress beach require large quantities of food at frequent intervals i can t possibly handle the entire commissariat department myself that s where you re going to help me like the splendid fellow you are and always have been the butler had now begun to gargle slightly he cast a look of agonized entreaty at the bullfinch but the bird had no comfort to offer it continued to chirp reflectively to itself like a man trying to remember a tune in his bath an enormous quantity of food they need proceeded ronnie you d be surprised here it is in this book i took from my uncle s desk at least six pounds of meal a day not to mention milk or buttermilk and bran made sloppy with swill speech at last returned to the butler it took the form at first of a faint sound like the cry of a frightened infant then words came but mr ronald ronnie stared at him incredulously he seemed to be wrestling with an unbelievable suspicion don t tell me you re thinking of throwing me down beach you my friend since i was so high he laughed he could see now how ridiculous the idea was of course you aren t you couldn t apart from wanting to do me a good turn you ve gathered by this time with that quick intelligence of yours that there s money in the thing ten quid down beach the moment you give the nod and nobody knows better than yourself that ten quid invested on baby bones for the medbury selling plate at the current odds means considerably more than a hundred in your sock on settling day but sir it s impossible i couldn t dream if ever it was found out really i don t think you ought to ask me mr ronald beach yes but really sir ronnie fixed him with a compelling eye think well beach who gave you creole queen for the lincolnshire but mr ronald who gave you mazawattee for the jubilee stakes beach what a beauty a tense silence fell upon the pantry even the bullfinch was hushed and it may interest you to know said ronnie that just before i left london i heard of something really hot for the goodwood cup a low gasp escaped beach all butlers are sportsmen and beach had been a butler for eighteen years mere gratitude for past favours might not have been enough in itself to turn the scale but this was different on the subject of form for the goodwood cup he had been quite unable to reach a satisfying decision it had baffled him for days he had been groping in the darkness jujube sir he whispered not jujube ginger george not ginger george it s no use your trying to guess for you ll never do it only two touts and the stable cat know this one but you shall know it beach the minute i give that pig back and claim my reward and that pig needs to be fed beach how about it for a long minute the butler stared before him silent then as if he felt that some simple symbolic act of the sort was what this moment demanded he went to the bullfinch s cage and put a green baize cloth over it tell me just what it is you wish me to do mr ronald he said v the dawn of another day crept upon blandings castle hour by hour the light grew stronger till piercing the curtains of ronnie s bedroom it woke him from a disturbed slumber he turned sleepily on the pillow he was dimly conscious of having had the most extraordinary dream all about stealing pigs in this dream he sat up with a jerk like cold water dashed in his face had come the realization that it had been no dream gosh said ronnie blinking few things have such a tonic effect on a young man accustomed to be a little heavy on waking in the morning as the discovery that he has stolen a prize pig overnight usually at this hour ronnie was more or less of an inanimate mass till kindly hands brought him his early cup of tea but to day he thrilled all down his pajama clad form with a novel alertness not since he had left school had he sprung out of bed but he did so now bed generally so attractive to him had lost its fascination he wanted to be up and about he had bathed shaved and was slipping into his trousers when his toilet was interrupted by the arrival of his old friend hugo carmody on hugo s face there was an expression which it was impossible to misread it indicated as plainly as a label that he had come bearing news and ronnie guessing the nature of this news braced himself to be suitably startled ronnie well heard what s happened what you know that pig of your uncle s what about it it s gone gone gone said hugo rolling the word round his tongue i met the old boy half a minute ago and he told me it seems he went down to the pig bin for a before breakfast look at the animal and it wasn t there wasn t there wasn t there how do you mean wasn t there well it wasn t wasn t there at all it had gone gone gone its room was empty and its bed had not been slept in well i m dashed said ronnie he was feeling pleased with himself he felt he had played his part well just the right incredulous amazement changing just soon enough into stunned belief you don t seem very surprised said hugo ronnie was stung the charge was monstrous yes i do he cried i seem frightfully surprised i am surprised why shouldn t i be surprised all right just as you say spring about a bit more though another time when i bring you these sensational items well i ll tell you one thing said hugo with satisfaction out of evil cometh good it s an ill wind that has no turning for me this startling occurrence has been a life saver i ve got thirty six hours leave out of it the old boy is sending me up to london to get a detective a what a detective a detective ronnie was conscious of a marked spasm of uneasiness he had not bargained for detectives from a place called the argus enquiry agency ronnie s uneasiness increased this thing was not going to be so simple after all he had never actually met a detective but he had read a lot about them they nosed about and found clues for all he knew he might have left a hundred clues naturally i shall have to stay the night in town and much as i like this place said hugo there s no denying that a night in town won t hurt i ve got fidgety feet and a spot of dancing will do me all the good in the world bring back the roses to my cheeks whose idea was it getting down this blighted detective demanded ronnie he knew he was not being nonchalant but he was disturbed mine yours eh all mine i suggested it you did did you said ronnie he directed at his companion a swift glance of a kind that no one should have directed at an old friend oh he said morosely well buzz off i want to dress vi a morning spent in solitary wrestling with a guilty conscience had left ronnie fish thoroughly unstrung by the time the clock over the stable struck the hour of one his mental condition had begun to resemble that of the late eugene aram he paced the lower terrace with bent head starting occasionally at the sudden chirp of a bird and longed for sue five minutes of sue he felt would make him a new man it was perfectly foul mused ronnie this being separated from the girl he loved there was something about sue he couldn t describe it but something that always seemed to act on a fellow s whole system like a powerful pick me up she was the human equivalent of those pink drinks you went and got or rather which you used to go and get before a good woman s love had made you give up all that sort of thing at that chemist s at the top of the haymarket after a wild night on the moors it must have been with a girl like sue in mind he felt that the poet had written those lines when something something something brow a ministering angel thou at this point in his meditations a voice from immediately behind him spoke his name i say ronnie it was only his cousin millicent he became calmer for an instant so deep always is a criminal s need for a confidant he had a sort of idea of sharing his hideous secret with this girl between whom and himself there had long existed a pleasant friendship then he abandoned the notion his secret was not one that could be lightly shared momentary relief of mind was not worth purchasing at the cost of endless anxiety ronnie have you seen mr carmody anywhere hugo he went up to london on the ten thirty went up to london what for he s gone to a place called the argus enquiry agency to get a detective what to investigate this business of the empress yes millicent laughed the idea tickled her i d like to be there to see old man argus s face when he finds that all he s wanted for is to track down missing pigs i should think he would beat hugo over the head with a bloodstain her laughter trailed away there had come into her face the look of one suddenly visited by a displeasing thought ronnie she said hullo do you know what what this looks fishy to me how do you mean well i don t know how it strikes you but this argus enquiry agency is presumably on the phone why didn t uncle clarence just ring them up and ask them to send down a man probably didn t think of it whose idea was it anyway getting down a man hugo s he suggested that he should run up to town yes i thought as much said millicent darkly what do you mean millicent s eyes narrowed she kicked moodily at a passing worm i don t like it she said it s fishy too much zeal it looks very much to me as if our mr carmody had a special reason for wanting to get up to london for the night and i think i know what the reason was did you ever hear of a girl named sue brown the start which ronnie gave eclipsed in magnitude all the other starts he had given that morning and they had been many and severe it isn t true what isn t true that there s anything whatever between hugo and sue brown oh well i had it from an authoritative source it was not the worm s lucky morning it had now reached ronnie and he kicked at it too the worm had the illusion that it had begun to rain shoes i ve got to go in and make a phone call said millicent abruptly ronnie scarcely noticed her departure he had supposed himself to have been doing some pretty tense thinking all the morning but compared with its activity now his brain hitherto had been stagnant it couldn t be true he told himself sue had said definitely that it wasn t and she couldn t have been lying to him girls like sue didn t lie and yet the sound of the luncheon gong floated over the garden well one thing was certain it was simply impossible to remain here at blandings castle getting his mind poisoned with doubts and speculations which for the life of him he could not keep out of it if he took the two seater and drove off in it the moment this infernal meal was over he could be in london before eight he could call at sue s flat receive her assurance once more that hugo carmody tall and lissom though he might be expert on the saxophone though he admittedly was meant nothing to her take her out to dinner and while dining ease his mind of that which weighed upon it then fortified with comfort and advice he could pop into the car and be back at the castle by lunch time on the following day it wasn t of course that he didn t trust her implicitly nevertheless ronnie went in to lunch chapter iv i if you go up beeston street in the southwestern postal division of london and follow the pavement on the right hand side you come to a blind alley called hayling court if you enter the first building on the left of this blind alley and mount a flight of stairs you find yourself facing a door on the ground glass of which is the legend argus enquiry agency ltd and below it to one side the smaller legend p frobisher pilbeam mgr and if at about the hour when ronnie fish had stepped into his two seater in the garage of blandings castle you had opened this door and gone in and succeeded in convincing the gentlemanly office boy that yours was a bona fide visit having nothing to do with the sale of life insurance proprietary medicines or handsomely bound sets of dumas you would have been admitted to the august presence of the manager himself p frobisher pilbeam was seated at his desk reading a telegram which had arrived during his absence at lunch this is peculiarly an age of young men starting out in business for themselves of rare unfettered spirits chafing at the bonds of employment and refusing to spend their lives working forty eight weeks in the year for a salary quite early in his career pilbeam had seen where the big money lay and decided to go after it as editor of that celebrated weekly scandal sheet society spice percy pilbeam had had exceptional opportunities of discovering in good time the true bent of his genius with the result that after three years of nosing out people s discreditable secrets on behalf of the mammoth publishing company his employers he had come to the conclusion that a man of his gifts would be doing far better for himself nosing out such secrets on his own behalf considerably to the indignation of lord tilbury the mammoth s guiding spirit he had borrowed some capital handed in his portfolio and was now in an extremely agreeable financial position the telegram over which he sat brooding with wrinkled forehead was just the sort of telegram an inquiry agent ought to have been delighted to receive being thoroughly cryptic and consequently a pleasing challenge to his astuteness as a detective but percy pilbeam in his ten minutes acquaintance with it had come to dislike it heartily he preferred his telegrams easier it ran as follows be sure send best man investigate big robbery it was unsigned what made the thing particularly annoying was that it was so tantalizing a big robbery probably meant jewels with a correspondingly big fee attached to their recovery but you can not scour england at random asking people if they have had a big robbery in their neighbourhood reluctantly he gave the problem up and producing a pocket mirror began with the aid of a pen nib to curl his small and revolting moustache his thoughts had drifted now to sue they were not altogether sunny thoughts for the difficulty of making sue s acquaintance was beginning to irk percy pilbeam he had written her notes he had sent her flowers and nothing had happened she ignored the notes and what she did with the flowers he did not know she certainly never thanked him for them brooding upon these matters he was interrupted by the opening of the door the gentlemanly office boy entered pilbeam looked up annoyed how many times have i told you not to come in here without knocking he asked sternly the office boy reflected seven he replied what would you have done if i had been in conference with an important client gone out again said the office boy working in a private enquiry agency you drop into the knack of solving problems well go out now very good sir i merely wished to say that while you were absent at lunch a gentleman called eh who was he the office boy who liked atmosphere and hoped some day to be promoted to the company of mr murphy and mr jones the two active assistants who had their lair on the ground floor thought for a moment of saying that beyond the obvious facts that the caller was a freemason left handed a vegetarian and a traveller in the east he had made no deductions from his appearance he perceived however that his employer was not in the vein for that sort of thing a mr carmody sir mr hugo carmody ah pilbeam displayed interest did he say he would call again he mentioned the possibility sir well if he does inform mr murphy and tell him to be ready when i ring the office boy retired and pilbeam returned to his thoughts of sue he was quite certain now that he did not like her attitude her attitude wounded him another thing he deplored was the reluctance of stage door keepers to reveal the private addresses of the personnel of the company really there seemed to be no way of getting to know the girl at all eight respectful knocks sounded on the door the office boy though occasionally forgetful was conscientious he had restored the average well mr carmody to see you sir pilbeam once more relegated sue to the hinterland of his mind business was business show him in this way sir said the office boy with a graceful courtliness which even taking into account the fact that he suffered from adenoids had an old world flavour and hugo sauntered across the threshold hugo felt and was looking quietly happy he seemed to bring the sunshine with him nobody could have been more wholeheartedly attached than he to blandings castle and the society of his millicent but he was finding london revisited singularly attractive and this if i mistake not watson is our client now said hugo genially such was his feeling of universal benevolence that he embraced with his goodwill even the repellent looking young man who had risen from the desk percy pilbeam s eyes were too small and too close together and he marcelled his hair in a manner distressing to right thinking people but to day he had to be lumped in with the rest of the species as a man and a brother so hugo bestowed a dazzling smile upon him he still thought pilbeam should not have been wearing pimples with a red tie one or the other if he liked but not both nevertheless he smiled upon him fine day he said quite said pilbeam very jolly the smell of the asphalt and carbonic gas quite some people might call london a shade on the stuffy side on an afternoon like this but not hugo carmody no no h carmody finds it just what the doctor ordered he sat down well sleuth he said to business i called before lunch but you were out yes but here i am again and i suppose you want to know what i ve come about when you re ready to get round to it said pilbeam patiently hugo stretched his long legs comfortably well i know you detective blokes always want a fellow to begin at the beginning and omit no detail for there is no saying how important some seemingly trivial fact may be omitting birth and early education then i am at the moment private secretary to lord emsworth at blandings castle in shropshire and said hugo i maintain a jolly good secretary others may think differently but that is my view blandings castle a thought had struck the proprietor of the argus enquiry agency he fumbled in his desk and produced the mysterious telegram yes as he had fancied it had been handed in at a place called market blandings do you know anything about this he asked pushing it across the desk hugo glanced at the document the old boy must have sent that after i left he said the absence of signature is no doubt due to mental stress lord emsworth is greatly perturbed a twitter shaken to the core you might say about this robbery exactly it has got right in amongst him pilbeam reached for pen and paper there was a stern set bloodhound sort of look in his eyes kindly give me the details hugo pondered for a moment it was a dark and stormy night no i m a liar the moon was riding serenely in the sky this big robbery tell me about it hugo raised his eyebrows big the telegram says big these telegraph operators will try to make sense you can t stop them editing the word should be pig lord emsworth s pig has been stolen pig cried percy pilbeam hugo looked at him a little anxiously you know what a pig is surely if not i m afraid there is a good deal of tedious spade work ahead of us the roseate dreams which the proprietor of the argus had had of missing jewels broke like bubbles he was deeply affronted a man of few ideals the one deep love of his life was for the inquiry agency which he had created and nursed to prosperity through all the dangers and vicissitudes which beset inquiry agencies in their infancy and the thought of being expected to apply its complex machinery to a search for lost pigs cut him as millicent had predicted to the quick does lord emsworth seriously suppose that i have time to waste looking for stolen pigs he demanded shrilly i never heard such nonsense in my life almost the exact words which all the other hawkshaws used finding you not at home explained hugo i spent the morning going round to other agencies i think i visited six in all and every one of them took the attitude you do i am not surprised nevertheless it seemed to me that they like you lacked vision this pig you see is a prize pig don t picture to yourself something with a kink in its tail sporting idly in the mud imagine rather a favourite daughter kidnapped from her ancestral home this is heavy stuff i assure you restore the animal in time for the agricultural show and you may ask of lord emsworth what you will even unto half his kingdom percy pilbeam rose he had heard enough i will not trouble lord emsworth the argus enquiry agency does not detect pigs i feared as much well well so be it and now said hugo affably may i take advantage of the beautiful friendship which has sprung up between us to use your telephone without waiting for permission for which indeed he would have had to wait some time he drew the instrument to him and gave a number he then began to chat again you seem a knowledgable sort of bloke he said perhaps you can tell me where the village swains go these days when they want to dance upon the green i have been absent for some little time from the centre of the vortex and i have become as a child in these matters what is the best that london has to offer to a young man with his blood up and the vine leaves more or less in his hair pilbeam was a man of business he had no wish to converse with this client who had disappointed him and wounded his finest feelings but it so happened that he had recently bought shares in a rising restaurant mario s he replied promptly it s the only place hugo sighed once he had dreamed that the answer to a question like that would have been the hot spot but where was the hot spot now gone like the flowers that wither in the first frost the lion and the lizard kept the courts where jamshyd gloried and after hours unfortunately which had started all the trouble drank deep ah well life was pretty complex a voice from the other end of the wire broke in on his reverie he recognized it as that of the porter of the block of flats where sue had her tiny abode hullo bashford mr carmody speaking will you make a long arm and haul miss brown to the instrument eh miss sue brown of course no other browns are any use to me whatsoever right ho i ll wait the astute detective never permits himself to exhibit emotion pilbeam turned his start of surprise into a grave distrait nod as if he were thinking out deep problems he took up his pen and drew three crosses and a squiggle on the blotting paper he was glad that no gentlemanly instinct had urged him to leave his visitor alone to do his telephoning mario s eh said hugo what s the band like it s leopard s good enough for me said hugo with enthusiasm he hummed a bar or two and slid his feet dreamily about the carpet i m shockingly out of practice dash it well that s that touching this other matter you re sure you won t come to blandings quite nice place gravel soil spreading views well laid out pleasure ground company s own water i would strongly advise you to bring your magnifying glass and spend the summer however if you really feel sue hullo ullo ullo this is hugo yes just up in town for the night on a mission of extraordinary secrecy and delicacy which i am not empowered to reveal speaking from the argus enquiry agency by courtesy of proprietor i was wondering if you would care to come out and help me restore my lost youth starting at about eight thirty eh a silence had fallen at the other end of the wire what was happening was that in the hall of the block of flats sue s conscience was fighting a grim battle against heavy odds ranged in opposition to it were her loneliness her love of dancing and her desire once more to see hugo who though he was not a man one could take seriously always cheered her up and made her laugh and she had been needing a laugh for days hugo thought he had been cut off hullo ullo ullo ullo ullo ullo he barked peevishly don t yodel like that said sue you ve nearly made me deaf sorry dear heart i thought the machine had conked well how do you react is it a bet i do want to see you again said sue hesitatingly you shall in person clean shirt white waistcoat the carmody studs and everything well a psychically gifted bystander standing in the hall of the block of flats would have heard at this moment a faint moan it was sue s conscience collapsing beneath an unexpected flank attack she had just remembered that if she went to dine with hugo she would learn all the latest news about ronnie it put the whole thing in an entirely different light surely ronnie himself could have no objection to the proposed feast if he knew that all she was going for was to talk about him she might dance a little of course but purely by the way her real motive in accepting the invitation she now realized quite clearly was to hear all about ronnie all right she said where mario s they tell me it s the posh spot these days mario s yes m for mange a for asthma r for rheumatism oh you ve got it all right then at eight thirty hugo put the receiver back once more he allowed his dazzling smile to play upon the argus s proprietor much obliged for use of instrument he said thank you thank you said pilbeam well i ll be pushing along ring us up if you change your mind market blandings x if you don t take on the job no one will i suppose there are other sleuths in london besides the bevy i ve interviewed to day but i m not going to see them i consider that i have done my bit and am through he looked about him make a good thing out of this business he asked for he was curious on these points and was never restrained by delicacy from seeking information quite what does the work consist of i ve often wondered measuring footprints and putting the tips of your fingers together and all that i suppose we are frequently asked to follow people and report on their movements hugo laughed amusedly well don t go following me and reporting on my movements much trouble might ensue bung oh good bye said percy pilbeam he pressed a bell on the desk and moved to the door to show his visitor out ii leopard s justly famous band its cheeks puffed out and its eyeballs rolling was playing a popular melody with lots of stomp in it and for the first time since she had accepted hugo s invitation to the dance sue gliding round the floor was conscious of a spiritual calm her conscience quieted by the moaning of the saxophones seemed to have retired from business it realized no doubt the futility of trying to pretend that there was anything wrong in a girl enjoying this delightful exercise how absurd she felt ronnie s objections were it was considered sue becoming analytical as if she were to make a tremendous fuss because he played tennis and golf with girls dancing was just a game like those two pastimes and it so happened that you had to have a man with you or you couldn t play it to get all jealous and throaty just because one went out dancing was simply ridiculous on the other hand placid though her conscience now was she had to admit that it was a relief to feel that he would never know of this little outing men were such children when they were in love sue found herself sighing over the opposite sex s eccentricities if they were only sensible how simple life would be it amazed her that ronnie could ever have any possible doubt however she might spend her leisure hours that her heart belonged to him alone she marvelled that he should suppose for a moment that even if she danced all night and every night with every other man in the world it would make any difference to her feelings toward him all the same holding the peculiar views he did he must undoubtedly be humoured you won t breathe a word to ronnie about our coming here will you hugo she said repeating an injunction which had been her opening speech on arriving at the restaurant not a syllable i can trust you implicitly telegraphic address discretion market blandings ronnie s funny you see one long scream i mean he wouldn t understand no great surprise it was to me said hugo doing complicated things with his feet to hear that you and the old leper had decided to team up you could have knocked me down with a feather odd he never confided in his boyhood friend well it wouldn t do for it to get about are you suggesting that hugo carmody is a babbler you do like gossipping you know you do i know nothing of the sort said hugo with dignity if i were asked to give my opinion i should say that i was essentially a strong silent man he made a complete circle of the floor in that capacity his taciturnity surprised sue what s the matter she asked dudgeon said hugo what i m sulking that remark of yours rankles that totally unfounded accusation that i can not keep a secret it may interest you to know that i too am secretly engaged and have never so much as mentioned it to a soul hugo yes betrothed and so at long last came a day when love wound his silken fetters about hugo carmody who s the unfortunate girl there is no unfortunate girl the lucky girl was that your foot yes sorry i haven t got the hang of these new steps yet the lucky girl i was saying is miss millicent threepwood as if stunned by the momentousness of the announcement the band stopped playing and chancing to be immediately opposite their table the man who never revealed secrets led his partner to her chair she was gazing at him ecstatically you don t mean that i do mean that what did you think i meant i never heard anything so wonderful in my life good news i m simply delighted i m pleased too said hugo i ve been trying not to admit it to myself but i was very scared about millicent ronnie told me the family wanted him and her to marry and you never know what may happen when families throw their weight about and now it s all right quite all right the music had started again but sue remained in her seat not said hugo astonished not just yet i want to talk you don t realize what this means to me besides your dancing s gone off hugo you re not the man you were i need practice he lighted a cigarette and tapped a philosophical vein of thought eying the gyrating couples meditatively it s the way they re always introducing new steps that bothers the man who has been living out in the woods i have become a rusty rustic i didn t mean you were bad only you used to be such a marvel dancing with you was like floating on a pink cloud above an ocean of bliss a very accurate description i should imagine agreed hugo but don t blame me blame these amalgamated professors of the dance or whatever they call themselves the birds who get together every couple of weeks or so to decide how they can make things more difficult amazing thing that they won t leave well alone you must have change i disagree with you said hugo no other walk in life is afflicted by a gang of thugs who are perpetually altering the rules of the game when you learn to play golf the professional doesn t tell you to bring the club up slowly and keep the head steady and roll the forearms and bend the left knee and raise the left heel and keep your eye on the ball and not sway back and a few more things and then after you ve sweated yourself to the bone learning all that suddenly add of course you understand that this is merely intended to see you through till about three weeks from next thursday after that the supreme grand council of consolidated divot shifters will scrap these methods and invent an entirely new set is this more dudgeon no not dudgeon it sounds like dudgeon i believe your little feelings are hurt because i said your dancing wasn t as good as it used to be not at all we welcome criticism well get your mind off it and tell me all about you and millicent and when i was about five resumed hugo removing his cigarette from the holder and inserting another i attended my first dancing school i m a bit shaky on some of the incidents of the days when i was trailing clouds of glory but i do remember that dancing school at great trouble and expense i was taught to throw up a rubber ball with my left hand and catch it with my right keeping the small of the back rigid and generally behaving in a graceful and attractive manner it doesn t sound a likely sort of thing to learn at a dancing school but i swear to you that that s what the curriculum was now the point i am making did you fall in love with millicent right away or was it gradual the point i am making is this i became very good at throwing and catching that rubber ball i dislike boasting but i stood out conspicuously among a pretty hot bunch people would nudge each other and say who is he behind their hands i don t suppose when i was feeling right i missed the rubber ball more than once in twenty goes but what good does it do me now absolutely none long before i got a chance of exhibiting my accomplishment in public and having beautiful women fawn on me for my skill the society of amalgamated professors of the dance decided that the rubber ball glide or whatever it was called was out of date is she very pretty and what i say is that all this chopping and changing handicaps a chap i am perfectly prepared at this moment to step out on that floor and heave a rubber ball about but it simply isn t being done nowadays people wouldn t understand what i was driving at in other words all the time and money and trouble that i spent on mastering the rubber ball shimmy is a dead loss i tell you if the amalgamated professors want to make people cynics they re going the right way to work i wish you would tell me all about millicent in a moment dancing they taught me at school dates back to the early egyptians who ascribed the invention to the god thoth the phrygian corybantes danced in honour of somebody whose name i ve forgotten and every time the festival of rhea silvia came round the ancient roman hoofers were there with their hair in a braid but what was good enough for the god thoth isn t good enough for these blighted amalgamated professors oh no and it s been the same all through the ages i don t suppose there has been a moment in history when some poor well meaning devil with ambition at one end of him and two left feet at the other wasn t getting it in the neck and all this said sue because you trod on my foot for just one half second hugo carmody dislikes to tread on women s feet even for half a second he has his pride ever hear of father mariana no mariana george born twelve hundred and something educated privately and at leipsic university hobbies fishing illuminating vellum and mangling the wurzel you must have heard of old pop mariana i haven t and i don t want to i want to hear about millicent it was the opinion of father mariana that dancing was a deadly sin he was particularly down i may mention on the saraband he said the saraband did more harm than the plague i know just how he felt i ll bet he had worked like a dog at twenty five pazazas the complete course of twelve lessons guaranteed to teach the fandango and just when his instructor had finally told him that he was fit to do it at the next saturday night social along came the amalgamated brothers with their new fangled saraband and where was pop leaning against the wall with the other foot and mouth diseasers trying to pretend dancing bored him did i hear you say you wanted a few facts about millicent you did sweetest girl on earth really absolutely it s well known all over shropshire and she really loves you between you and me said hugo confidentially i don t wonder you speak in that amazed tone if you saw her you d be still more surprised i am a man who thinks before he speaks i weigh my words and i tell you solemnly that that girl is too good for me but you re a sweet darling precious pet i know i m a sweet darling precious pet nevertheless i still maintain that she is too good for me she is the nearest thing to an angel that ever came glimmering through the laurels in the quiet evenfall in the garden by the turrets of the old manorial hall hugo i d no idea you were so poetical enough to make a chap poetical loving a girl like that and you really do love her hugo took a feverish gulp of champagne and rolled his eyeballs as if he had been a member of leopold s justly famous band madly devotedly and when i think how i have deceived her my soul sickens have you deceived her not yet but i m going to in about five minutes i put in a phone call to blandings just now and when i get through i shall tell her i m speaking from my hotel bedroom where i am on the point of going to bed you see said hugo confidentially millicent though practically perfect in every other respect is one of those girls who might misunderstand this little night out of mine did it but come to her ears speaking of which you ought to see them like alabaster shells i know what you mean ronnie s like that hugo stared ronnie yes you mean to sit there and tell me that ronnie s ears are like alabaster shells no i meant that he would be furious if he knew that i had come out dancing and oh i do love dancing so sighed sue he must never know no that s why i asked you just now not to tell him i won t secrecy and silence thank goodness there s nobody who could tell millicent even if they wanted to ah this must be the bringer of glad tidings come to say my call is through all set he asked the page boy who had threaded his way through the crowd to their table yes sir hugo rose amuse yourself somehow till i return i shan t be dull said sue she watched him disappear then leaned back in her seat watching the dancers her eyes were bright and hugo s news had brought a flush to her cheeks percy pilbeam who had been hovering in the background hoping for such an opportunity ever since his arrival at the restaurant thought he had never seen her looking prettier he edged between the tables and took hugo s vacated chair there are men who approaching a member of the other sex wait for permission before sitting down and men who sit down without permission pilbeam was one of the latter good evening he said she turned and was aware of a nasty looking little man at her elbow he seemed to have materialized from nowhere may i introduce myself miss brown said this blot my name is pilbeam at the same moment there appeared in the doorway and stood there raking the restaurant with burning eyes the flannel suited figure of ronald overbury fish iii ronnie fish s estimate of the time necessary for reaching london from blandings castle in a sports model two seater had been thrown out of gear by two mishaps halfway down the drive the car had developed some mysterious engine trouble which had necessitated taking it back to the stables and having it overhauled by lord emsworth s chauffeur it was not until nearly an hour later that he had been able to resume his journey and a blow out near oxford had delayed him still further he arrived at sue s flat just as sue and hugo were entering mario s ringing sue s front door bell produced no result ronnie regretted that in the stress of all the other matters that occupied his mind he had forgotten to send her a telegram he was about to creep away and have a bite of dinner at the drones club a prospect which pleased him not at all for the drones at dinner time was always full of hearty eggs who talked much too loud for a worried man s nerves and might even go so far as to throw bread at him when descending the stairs into the hall he came upon bashford the porter bashford who knew ronnie well said ullo mr fish and ronnie said hullo bashford and bashford said the weather seemed to keep up and ronnie said yes that s right it did and it was at this point that the porter uttered these memorable and as events proved epoch making words if you re looking for miss brown mr fish i ve an idea she s gone to a place called mario s he poured further details into ronnie s throbbing ear mr carmody had rung up on the phone might have been ar parse four and he bashford not listening but happening to hear had thought he had caught something said about this place mario s mario s said ronnie thanks bashford mario s eh right the porter for eton and cambridge train their sons well found nothing in the way mr fish spoke to cause a thrill totally unaware that he had been conversing with othello s younger brother he went back to his den in the basement and sat down with a good appetite to steak and chips and ronnie quivering from head to foot started the car and drove off jealousy said shakespeare and he was about right is a green eyed monster which doth mock the meat he feeds on by the time ronald overbury fish pushed through the swinging door that guards the revelry at mario s from the gaze of the passer by he was like the othello he so much resembled perplexed in the extreme he felt hot all over then cold all over then hot again and the waiter who stopped him on the threshold of the dining room to inform him that evening dress was indispensable on the dancing floor and that flannel suits must go up to the balcony was running a risk which would have caused his insurance company to purse its lips and shake its head fortunately for him ronnie did not hear he was scanning the crowd before him in an effort to find sue plenty of room in the balcony sir urged the waiter continuing to play with fire this time ronnie did become dimly aware that somebody was addressing him and he was about to turn and give the man one look when halfway down a grove of black coats and gaily coloured frocks he suddenly saw what he was searching for the next moment he was pushing a path through the throng treading on the toes of brave men and causing fair women to murmur bitterly that this sort of thing ought to be prevented by the management five yards from sue s table ronnie fish would have said that his cup was full and could not possibly be made any fuller but when he had covered another two and pushed aside a fat man who was standing in the fairway he realized his mistake it was not hugo who was sue s companion but a reptilian looking squirt with narrow eyes and his hair done in ridges and as he saw him something seemed to go off in ronnie s brain like a released spring a waiter pausing with a tray of glasses pointed out to him that on the dancing floor evening dress was indispensable gentlemen in flannel suits he added could be accommodated in the balcony plenty of room in the balcony sir said the waiter ronnie reached the table pilbeam at the moment was saying that he had wanted for a long time to meet sue he hoped she had got his flowers all right it was perhaps a natural desire to look at anything but this odious and thrusting individual who had forced his society upon her that caused sue to raise her eyes raising them she met ronnie s and as she saw him her conscience which she had supposed lulled for the night sprang to life more vociferous than ever it had but been crouching the better to spring ronnie she started up pilbeam also rose the waiter with the glasses pressed the edge of his tray against ronnie s elbow in a firm but respectful manner and told him that on the dancing floor evening dress was indispensable gentlemen in flannel suits however would find ample accommodation in the balcony ronnie did not speak and it would have been better if sue had not done so for at this crisis some subconscious instinct of the kind which is always waiting to undo us at critical moments suggested to her dazed mind that when two men who do not know each other are standing side by side in a restaurant one ought to introduce them mr fish mr pilbeam murmured sue only the ringing of the bell that heralds the first round of a heavy weight championship fight could have produced more instant and violent results through ronnie s flannel clad body a sort of galvanic shock seemed to pass pilbeam he had come expecting hugo and hugo would have been bad enough but pilbeam the man she had said she didn t even know the man she hadn t met the man whose gifts of flowers she had professed to resent in person in the flesh hobnobbing with her in a restaurant by god he meant to say by george good gosh his fists clenched eton was forgotten cambridge not even a memory he inhaled so sharply that a man at the next table who was eating a mousse of chicken stabbed himself in the chin with his fork he turned on pilbeam with a hungry look and at this moment the waiter raising his voice a little for he was beginning to think that ronnie s hearing was slightly affected mentioned as an interesting piece of information that the management of mario s preferred to reserve the dancing floor exclusively for clients in evening dress but there was a bright side gentlemen in flannel suits could be accommodated in the balcony it was the waiter who saved percy pilbeam just as a mosquito may divert for an instant a hunter who is about to spring at and bite in the neck a tiger of the jungle so did this importunate waiter divert ronnie fish what it was all about he was too overwrought to ascertain but he knew that the man was annoying him pestering him trying to chat with him when he had business elsewhere with all the force of a generous nature sorely tried he plugged the waiter in the stomach with his elbow there was a crash which even leopold s band could not drown the man who had stabbed himself with the fork had his meal still further spoiled by the fact that it suddenly began to rain glass and as regards the other occupants of the restaurant the word sensation about sums the situation up ronnie and the management of mario s now formed two sharply contrasted schools of thought to ronnie the only thing that seemed to matter was this pilbeam this creeping slinking cuckoo in the nest pilbeam the lothario who had lowered all speed records in underhand villainy by breaking up his home before he had got one he concentrated all his faculties to the task of getting round the table to the other side of which the object of his dislike had prudently withdrawn and showing him in no uncertain manner where he got off to the management on the other hand the vital issue was all this broken glassware the waiter had risen from the floor but the glasses were still there and scarcely one of them was in a condition ever to be used again for the refreshment of mario s customers the head waiter swooping down on the fray like some god in the iliad descending from a cloud was endeavouring to place this point of view before ronnie assisting him with word and gesture were two inferior waiters waiter a and waiter b ronnie was in no mood for abstract debate he hit the head waiter in the abdomen waiter a in the ribs and was just about to dispose of waiter b when his activities were hampered by the sudden arrival of re enforcements from all parts of the room other waiters had assembled to name but a few waiters c d e f g and h and he found himself hard pressed it seemed to him that he had dropped into a waiters convention as far as the eye could reach the arena was crammed with waiters and more coming pilbeam had disappeared altogether and so busy was ronnie now that he did not even miss him he had reached that condition of mind which the old vikings used to call berserk and which among modern malays is termed running amok ronnie fish in the course of his life had had many ambitions as a child he had yearned some day to become an engine driver at school it had seemed to him that the most attractive career the world had to offer was that of the professional cricketer later he had hoped to run a prosperous night club but now in his twenty sixth year all these desires were cast aside and forgotten the only thing in life that seemed really worth while was to massacre waiters and to this task he addressed himself with all the energy and strength at his disposal matters now began to move briskly waiter c who rashly clutched the sleeve of ronnie s coat reeled back with a hand pressed to his right eye waiter d a married man contented himself with standing on the outskirts and talking italian but waiter e made of sterner stuff hit ronnie rather hard with a dish containing omelette aux champignons and it was as the latter reeled beneath this buffet that there suddenly appeared in the forefront of the battle a figure wearing a gay uniform and almost completely concealed behind a vast moustache waxed at the ends it was the commissionaire from the street door and anybody who has ever been bounced from a restaurant knows that commissionaires are heavy metal this one whose name was mcteague and who had spent many lively years in the army before retiring to take up his present duties had a grim face made of some hard kind of wood and the muscles of a village blacksmith a man of action rather than words he clove his way through the press in silence only when he reached the centre of the maelstrom did he speak this was when ronnie leaping onto a chair the better to perform the operation hit him on the nose on receipt of this blow he uttered the brief monosyllable ho and then without more delay scooped ronnie into an embrace of steel and bore him toward the door through which was now moving a long large leisurely policeman iv it was some few minutes later that hugo carmody emerging from the telephone booth on the lower floor where the cocktail bar is sauntered back into the dancing room and was interested to find waiters massaging bruised limbs other waiters replacing fallen tables and leopold s band playing in a sort of hushed undertone like a band that has seen strange things hullo said hugo anything up he eyed sue inquiringly she looked to him like a girl who has had some sort of a shock not or his eyes deceived him at all her old bright self what s up he asked take me home hugo hugo stared home already with the night yet young oh hugo take me home quick just as you say assented hugo agreeably he was now pretty certain that something was up one second to settle the bill and then homeward ho and on the way you shall tell me all about it for i jolly well know said hugo who prided himself on his keenness of observation that something is or has been up chapter v the law of great britain is a remorseless machine which once set in motion ignores first causes and takes into account only results it will not accept shattered dreams as an excuse for shattering glassware nor will you get far by pleading a broken heart in extenuation of your behaviour in breaking waiters haled on the morrow before the awful majesty of justice at bosher street police court and charged with disorderly conduct in a public place to wit mario s restaurant and resisting an officer to wit p c murgatroyd in the execution of his duties ronald fish made no impassioned speeches he did not raise clenched fists aloft and call upon heaven to witness that he was a good man wronged experience dearly bought in the days of his residence at the university had taught him that when the law gripped you with its talons the only thing to do was to give a false name say nothing and hope for the best shortly before noon accordingly on the day following the painful scene just described edwin jones of nasturtium villas cricklewood poorer by the sum of five pounds was being conveyed in a swift taxicab to his friend hugo carmody s hotel there to piece together his broken life and try to make a new start on the part of the man jones himself during the ride there was a disposition toward silence he gazed before him bleakly and gnawed his lower lip hugo carmody on the other hand was inclined to be rather jubilant it seemed to hugo that after a rocky start things had panned out pretty well a nice smooth job he said approvingly i was scanning the beak s face closely during the summing up and i couldn t help fearing for a moment that it was going to be a case of fourteen days without the option as it is here you are a free man and no chance of your name being in the paper a moral victory i call it ronnie released his lower lip in order to bare his teeth in a bitter sneer i wouldn t care if my name were in every paper in london oh come old loofah the honoured name of fish what do i care about anything now hugo was concerned this morbid strain he felt was unworthy of a nasturtium villas jones aren t you rather tending to make a bit too much heavy weather over this heavy weather i think you are after all when you come right down to it what has happened you find poor little sue don t call her poor little sue you find the party of the second part amended hugo at a dance place well why not what if you follow me of it where s the harm in her going out to dance with a man she swore she didn t know well at the time when you asked her probably she didn t know him things move quickly in a great city i wish i had a quid for every girl i ve been out dancing with whom i hadn t known from eve a couple of days before she promised me she wouldn t go out with a soul ah but with a merry twinkle in her eye no doubt i mean to say you can t expect a girl nowadays to treat a promise like that seriously i mean dash it be reasonable and with that little worm of all people hugo cleared his throat he was conscious of a slight embarrassment he had not wished to touch on this aspect of the affair but ronnie s last words gave a carmody and a gentleman no choice as a matter of fact ronnie old man he said you are wrong in supposing that she went to mario s with the above pilbeam she went with me blameless hugo what i mean more like a brother than anything ronnie declined to be comforted i don t believe you my dear chap i suppose you think you re damned clever trying to smooth things over she was at mario s with pilbeam i took her there you may have taken her but she was dining with pilbeam nothing of the kind do you think i can t believe my own eyes it s no use your saying anything hugo i m through with her she s let me down less than a week i ve been away said ronnie his voice trembling and she lets me down well it serves me right for being such a fool as to think she ever cared a curse for me he relapsed into silence and hugo after turning over in his mind a few specimen remarks decided not to make them the cab drew up before the hotel and ronnie getting out uttered a wordless exclamation no let me said hugo considerately a bit rough on a man he felt after coughing up five quid to the hellhounds of the law to be expected to pay the cab he produced money and turned to the driver it was some moments before he turned back again for the driver by the rules of the taxi chauffeurs union kept his petty cash tucked into his underclothing when he did so he was considerably astonished to find that ronnie while his back was turned had in some unaccountable manner become sue the changeling was staring unhappily at him from the exact spot where he had left his old friend hullo he said ronnie s gone said sue gone yes he walked off as quick as he could round the corner when he saw me he sue s voice broke he didn t say a word how did you get here asked hugo there were other matters of course to be discussed later but he felt he must get this point cleared up first i thought you would bring him back to your hotel and i thought that if i could see him i could say something hugo was alarmed he was now practically certain that this girl was going to cry and if there was one thing he disliked it was being with crying girls in a public spot he would not readily forget the time when a female named yvonne something had given way to a sudden twinge of neuralgia in his company not far from piccadilly circus and an old lady had stopped and said that it was brutes like him who caused all the misery in the world come inside he urged quickly come and have a cocktail or a cup of tea or a bun or something i say he said as he led the way into the hotel lobby and found two seats in a distant corner i m frightfully sorry about all this i can t help feeling it s my fault oh no if i hadn t asked you to dinner it isn t that that s the trouble ronnie might have been a little cross for a minute or two if he had found you and me together but he would soon have got over it it was finding me with that horrid little man pilbeam you see i told him and it was quite true that i didn t know him yes so he was saying to me in the cab did he what did he say well he plainly resented the pilbeam i m afraid his manner when touching on the pilbeam was austere i tried to drive into his head that that was just an accidental meeting and that you had come to mario s with me but he would have none of it i fear old thing there s nothing to be done but leave the whole binge to time the great healer a page boy was making a tour of the lobby he seemed to be seeking a mr gargery if only i could get hold of him and make him listen i haven t been given a chance to explain you think you could explain even if given a chance i could try surely he couldn t help seeing that i really loved him if we had a real talk and the trouble is you re here and he ll be back at blandings in a few hours difficult said hugo shaking his head complex mr carmody chanted the page boy coming nearer mr carmody hi cried hugo mr carmody wanted on the telephone sir hugo s face became devout and saintlike awfully sorry to leave you for an instant he said but do you mind if i rush it must be millicent she s the only person who knows i m here he sped away and sue watching him found herself choking with sudden tears it seemed to emphasize her forlornness so this untimely evidence of another love story that had not gone awry she seemed to be listening to that telephone conversation hearing hugo s delighted yelps as the voice of the girl he loved floated to him over the wire she pulled herself together beastly of her to be jealous of hugo just because he was happy sue sat up abruptly she had had an idea it was a breath taking idea but simple it called for courage for audacity for a reckless disregard of consequences but nevertheless it was simple hugo she cried as that lucky young man returned and dropped into the chair at her side hugo listen i say said hugo i ve suddenly thought i say said hugo do listen i say said hugo that was millicent on the phone was it how nice listen hugo speaking from blandings yes but and she has broken off the engagement what broken off the bally engagement repeated hugo he signalled urgently to a passing waiter get me a brandy and soda will you he said his face was pale and set a stiffish brandy and soda please brandy and soda sir yes said hugo stiffish chapter vi sue stared at him bewildered broken off the engagement broken off the engagement in moments of stress the foolish question is always the one that comes uppermost in the mind are you sure hugo emitted a sound which resembled the bursting of a paper bag he would have said himself if asked that he was laughing mirthlessly sure not much doubt about it but why she knows all all what everything you poor fish said hugo forgetting in a strong man s agony the polish of the carmodys she s found out that i took you to dinner last night what she has but how the paper bag exploded again a look of intense bitterness came into hugo s face if ever i meet that slimy slinking marcelle waved by product pilbeam again he said let him commend his soul to god if he has time he added he took the brandy and soda from the waiter and eyed sue dully anything on similar lines for you no thanks just as you like it s not easy for a man in my position to realize said hugo drinking deeply that refusing a brandy and soda is possible i shouldn t have said offhand that it could be done sue was a warm hearted girl in the tragedy of this announcement she had almost forgotten that she had troubles herself tell me all about it hugo he put down the empty glass i came up from blandings yesterday he said to interview the argus enquiry agency on the subject of sending a man down to investigate the theft of lord emsworth s pig sue would have liked to hear more about this pig but she knew that this was no time for questions i went to the argus and saw this wen pilbeam who runs it again sue would have liked to speak once more she refrained she felt as if she were at a sick bed hearing a dying man s last words on such occasions one does not interrupt meanwhile proceeded hugo tonelessly millicent suspecting and i am surprised at her having a mind like that i always looked on her as a pure white soul suspecting that i might be up to something in london got the argus on the long distance telephone and told them to follow my movements and report to her and apparently just before she called me up she had been talking to them on the wire and getting their statement all this she revealed to me in short burning sentences and then she said that if i thought we were still engaged i could have three more guesses but to save me trouble she would tell me the right answer viz no wedding bells for me and to think said hugo picking up the glass and putting it down again after inspection with a hurt and disappointed look that i actually rallied this growth pilbeam on the subject of following people and reporting on their movements yes i assure you rallied him blithely just as i was leaving his office we kidded merrily back and forth and then i went out into the world happy and care free little knowing that my every step was dogged by a blasted bloodhound well all i can say is that if ronnie wants this pilbeam s gore and i gather that he does he will jolly well have to wait till i ve helped myself sue womanlike blamed the woman i don t think millicent can be a very nice girl she said primly an angel said hugo always was celebrated for it i don t blame her i do i don t i do well have it your own way said hugo handsomely he beckoned to the waiter another of the same please this settles it said sue her eyes were sparkling her chin had a resolute tilt settles what while you were at the telephone i had an idea i have had ideas in my time said hugo many of them at the moment i have but one to get within arm s length of the yam pilbeam and twist his greasy neck till it comes apart in my hands what do you do here i said measure footprints we follow people and report on their movements said he ha ha i laughed carelessly ha ha laughed he general mirth and jollity and all the while hugo will you listen and this is the bitter thought that now strikes me what chance have i of scooping out the man s inside with my bare hands i ve got to go back to blandings on the two fifteen or i lose my job leaving him unscathed in his bally lair chuckling over my downfall and following some other poor devil s movements hugo the broken man passed a weary hand over his forehead you spoke i ve been speaking for the last ten minutes only you won t listen say on said hugo listlessly starting on the second restorative have you ever heard of a miss schoonmaker i seem to know the name who is she me hugo lowered his glass pained don t talk drip to a broken hearted man he begged what do you mean when ronnie was driving me in his car we met lady constance keeble a blister said hugo always was generally admitted all over shropshire she thought i was this miss schoonmaker why because ronnie said i was hugo sighed hopelessly complex complex my god how complex it was quite simple and natural ronnie had just been telling me about this girl how he had met her at biarritz and that she was coming to blandings and so on and when he saw lady constance looking at me with frightful suspicion it suddenly occurred to him to say that i was her that you were lady constance no idiot miss schoonmaker and now i m going to wire her lady constance not miss schoonmaker in case you were going to ask saying that i m coming to blandings right away pretending to be this miss schoonmaker yes hugo shook his head imposs why absolutely out of the q why lady constance is expecting me do be sensible i m being sensible all right but somebody is gibbering and naming no names it s you don t you realize that just as you reach the front door this miss schoonmaker will arrive in person dishing the whole thing no she won t why won t she because ronnie sent her a telegram in lady constance s name saying that there s scarlet fever or something at blandings and she wasn t to come hugo s air of the superior critic fell from him like a garment he sat up in his chair so moved was he that he spilled his brandy and soda and did not give it so much as a look of regret he let it soak into the carpet unheeded sue once i m at blandings i shall be able to see ronnie and make him be sensible that s right and then you ll be able to tell millicent that there couldn t have been much harm in my being out with you last night because i m engaged to ronnie that s right too can you see any flaws not a flaw i suppose as a matter of fact you ll give the whole thing away in the first five minutes by calling me sue hugo waved an arm buoyantly don t give the possibility another thought he said if i do i ll cover it up adroitly by saying i meant schoo short for schoonmaker and now go and send her another telegram keep on sending telegrams leave nothing to chance send a dozen and pitch it strong say that blandings castle is ravaged with disease not merely scarlet fever scarlet fever and mumps not to mention housemaid s knee diabetes measles shingles and the botts we re onto a big thing my susan let us push it along chapter vii i sunshine calling to all right thinking men to come out and revel in its heartening warmth poured in at the windows of the great library of blandings castle but to clarence ninth earl of emsworth much as he liked sunshine as a rule it brought no cheer his face drawn his pince nez askew his tie drooping away from its stud like a languorous lily he sat staring sightlessly before him he looked like something that had just been prepared for stuffing by a taxidermist a moralist watching lord emsworth in his travail would have reflected smugly that it cuts both ways this business of being a peer of the realm with large private means and a good digestion unalloyed prosperity he would have pointed out in his offensive way tends to enervate and in this world of ours full of alarms and uncertainties where almost anything is apt to drop suddenly on top of your head without warning at almost any moment what one needs is to be tough and alert when some outstanding disaster happens to the ordinary man it finds him prepared years of missing the eight forty five taking the dog for a run on rainy nights endeavouring to abate smoky chimneys and coming down to breakfast and discovering that they have burned the bacon again have given his soul a protective hardness so that by the time his wife s relations arrive for a long visit he is ready for them lord emsworth had had none of this salutary training fate hitherto had seemed to spend its time thinking up ways of pampering him he ate well slept well and had no money troubles he grew the best roses in shropshire he had won a first prize for pumpkins at that county s agricultural show a thing no earl of emsworth had ever done before and just previous to the point at which this chronicle opens his younger son frederick had married the daughter of an american millionaire and had gone to live three thousand miles away from blandings castle with lots of good deep water in between him and it he had come to look on himself as fate s spoiled darling can we wonder then that in the agony of this sudden treacherous blow he felt stunned and looked eviscerated is it surprising that the sunshine made no appeal to him may we not consider him justified as he sat there in swallowing a lump in his throat like an ostrich gulping down a brass door knob the answer to these questions in the order given is no no and yes the door of the library opened revealing the natty person of his brother galahad lord emsworth straightened his pince nez and looked at him apprehensively knowing how little reverence there was in the hon galahad s composition and how tepid was his interest in the honourable struggles for supremacy of fat pigs he feared that the other was about to wound him in his bereavement with some jarring flippancy then his gaze softened and he was conscious of a soothing feeling of relief there was no frivolity in his brother s face only a gravity which became him well the hon galahad sat down hitched up the knees of his trousers cleared his throat and spoke in a tone that could not have been more sympathetic or in better taste bad business this clarence appalling my dear fellow what are you going to do about it lord emsworth shrugged his shoulders hopelessly he generally did when people asked him what he was going to do about things i am at a loss he confessed i do not know how to act what young carmody tells me has completely upset all my plans carmody i sent him to the argus enquiry agency in london to engage the services of a detective it is a firm that sir gregory parsloe once mentioned to me in the days when we were on better terms he said in rather a meaning way i thought that if ever i had any trouble of any sort that needed expert and tactful handling these were the people to go to i gathered that they had assisted him in some matter the details of which he did not confide to me and had given complete satisfaction parsloe said the hon galahad and sniffed so i sent young carmody to london to approach them about finding the empress and now he tells me that his errand proved fruitless they were firm in their refusal to trace missing pigs just as well what do you mean save you a lot of unnecessary expense there s no need for you to waste money employing detectives i thought that possibly the trained mind i can tell you who s got the empress i ve known it all along what certainly galahad it s as plain as the nose on your face lord emsworth felt his nose is it he said doubtfully i ve just been talking to constance constance lord emsworth opened his mouth feebly she hasn t got my pig i ve just been talking to constance repeated the hon galahad and she called me some very unpleasant names she does sometimes even as a child i remember most unpleasant names a senile mischief maker among others and a meddling old penguin and all because i told her that the man who had stolen empress of blandings was young gregory parsloe parsloe parsloe surely it s obvious i should have thought it would have been clear to the meanest intelligence from boyhood up lord emsworth had possessed an intelligence about as mean as an intelligence can be without actually being placed under restraint nevertheless he found his brother s theory incredible parsloe don t keep saying parsloe but my dear galahad it stands to reason you don t really think so of course i think so have you forgotten what i told you the other day yes said lord emsworth he always forgot what people told him the other day about young parsloe said the hon galahad impatiently about his nobbling my dog towser lord emsworth started it all came back to him a hard expression crept into the eyes behind the pince nez which emotion had just jerked crooked again to be sure towser your dog i remember he nobbled towser and he s nobbled the empress dash it clarence use your intelligence who else except young parsloe had any interest in getting the empress out of the way and if he hadn t known there was some dirty work being planned would that pig man of his brotherhood or whatever his name is have been going about offering three to one on pride of matchingham i told you at the time it was fishy the evidence was damning and yet lord emsworth found himself once more a prey to doubt of the blackness of sir gregory parsloe parsloe s soul he had of course long been aware but could the man actually be capable of the crime of the century a fellow landowner a justice of the peace a man who grew pumpkins a baronet but galahad a man in parsloe s position what do you mean a man in his position do you suppose a fellow changes his nature just because a cousin of his dies and he comes into a baronetcy haven t i told you a dozen times that i ve known young parsloe all his life known him intimately he was always as hot as mustard and as wide as leicester square ask anybody who used to go around town in those days when they saw young parsloe coming strong men winced and hid their valuables he hadn t a penny except what he could get by telling the tale and he always did himself like a prince when i knew him first he was living down on the river at shepperton his old father the dean had made an arrangement with the keeper of the pub there to give him breakfast and bed and nothing else if he wants dinner he must earn it the old boy said and do you know how he used to earn it he trained that mongrel of his banjo to go and do tricks in front of parties that came to the place in steam launches and then he would stroll up and hope his dog was not annoying them and stand talking till they went in to dinner and then go in with them and pick up the wine list and before they knew what was happening he would be bursting with their champagne and cigars that s the sort of fellow young parsloe was but even so i remember him running up to me outside that pub one afternoon the jolly miller it was called his face shining with positive ecstasy come in quick he said there s a new barmaid and she hasn t found out yet i m not allowed credit but galahad and if young parsloe thinks i ve forgotten a certain incident that occurred in the early summer of the year he s very much mistaken he met me in the haymarket and took me into the two goslings for a drink there s a hat shop now where it used to be and after we d had it he pulls a sort of dashed little top affair out of his pocket a thing with numbers written round it said he d found it in the street and wondered who thought of these ingenious little toys and insisted on our spinning it for half crowns you take the odd numbers i ll take the even says young parsloe and before i could fight my way out into the fresh air i was ten pounds seven and sixpence in the hole and i discovered next morning that they make those beastly things so that if you push the stem through and spin them the wrong way up you re bound to get an even number and when i asked him the following afternoon to show me that top again he said he d lost it that s the sort of fellow young parsloe was and you expect me to believe that inheriting a baronetcy and settling down in the country has made him so dashed pure and high minded that he wouldn t stoop to nobbling a pig lord emsworth uncoiled himself cumulative evidence had done its work his eyes glittered and he breathed stertorously the scoundrel tough nut always was what shall i do do why go to him right away and tax him tax him yes look him squarely in the eye and tax him with his crime i will immediately i ll come with you look him squarely in the eye and tax him and tax him lord emsworth had reached the hall and was peering agitatedly to right and left where the devil s my hat i can t find my hat somebody s always hiding my hat i will not have my hats hidden you don t need a hat to tax a man with stealing a pig said the hon galahad who was well versed in the manners and rules of good society ii in his study at matchingham hall in the neighbouring village of much matchingham sir gregory parsloe parsloe sat gazing at the current number of a weekly paper we have seen that weekly paper before on that occasion it was in the plump hands of beach and oddly enough what had attracted sir gregory s attention was the very item which had interested the butler the hon galahad threepwood brother of the earl of emsworth a little bird tells us that gally is at blandings castle shropshire the ancestral seat of the family busily engaged in writing his reminiscences as every member of the old brigade will testify they ought to be as warm as the weather if not warmer but whereas beach perusing this had chuckled sir gregory parsloe parsloe shivered like one who on a country ramble suddenly perceives a snake in his path sir gregory parsloe parsloe of matchingham hall seventh baronet of his line was one of those men who start their lives well skid for a while and then slide back onto the straight and narrow path and stay there that is to say he had been up to the age of twenty a blameless boy and from the age of thirty one when he had succeeded to the title a practically blameless bart so much so that now in his fifty second year he was on the eve of being accepted by the local unionist committee as their accredited candidate for the forthcoming by election in the bridgeford and shifley parliamentary division of shropshire but there had been a decade in his life that dangerous decade of the twenties when he had accumulated a past so substantial that a less able man would have been compelled to spread it over a far longer period it was an epoch in his life to which he did not enjoy looking back and years of irreproachable barthood had enabled him as far as he personally was concerned to bury the past and now it seemed this pestilential companion of his youth was about to dig it up again the years had turned sir gregory into a man of portly habit and as portly men do in moments of stress he puffed but puff he never so shrewdly he could not blow away that paragraph it was still there looking up at him when the door opened and the butler announced lord emsworth and mr galahad threepwood sir gregory s first emotion on seeing the taxing party file into the room was one of pardonable surprise aware of the hard feelings which george cyril wellbeloved s transference of his allegiance had aroused in the bosom of that gifted pig man s former employer he had not expected to receive a morning call from the earl of emsworth as for the hon galahad he had ceased to be on cordial terms with him as long ago as the winter of the year nineteen hundred and six then following quickly on the heels of surprise came indignation that the author of the reminiscences should be writing scurrilous stories about him with one hand and strolling calmly into his private study with so to speak the other occasioned him the keenest resentment he drew himself up and was in the very act of staring haughtily when the hon galahad broke the silence young parsloe said the hon galahad speaking in a sharp unpleasant voice your sins have found you out it had been the baronet s intention to inquire to what he was indebted for the pleasure of this visit and to inquire it icily but at this remarkable speech the words halted on his lips eh he said blankly the hon galahad was regarding him through his monocle rather as a cook eyes a black beetle on discovering it in the kitchen sink it was a look which would have aroused pique in a slug and once more the squire of matchingham s bewilderment gave way to wrath what the devil do you mean he demanded see his face asked the hon galahad in a rasping aside i m looking at it now said lord emsworth guilt written upon it plainly agreed lord emsworth the hon galahad who had folded his arms in a menacing manner unfolded them and struck the desk a smart blow be very careful parsloe think before you speak and when you speak speak the truth i may say by way of a start that we know all how low an estimate sir gregory parsloe had formed of his visitors collective sanity was revealed by the fact that it was actually to lord emsworth that he now turned as the more intelligent one of the pair emsworth explain what the deuce are you doing here and what the devil is that old image talking about lord emsworth had been watching his brother with growing admiration the latter s spirited opening of the case for the prosecution had won his hearty approval you know he said curtly i should say he dashed well does know said the hon galahad parsloe produce that pig sir gregory pushed his eyes back into their sockets a split second before they would have bulged out of his head beyond recovery he did his best to think calm soothing thoughts he had just remembered that he was a man who had to be careful about his blood pressure pig pig did you say pig pig what pig he says what pig i heard him said lord emsworth sir gregory parsloe again had trouble with his eyes i don t know what you are talking about the hon galahad unfolded his arms again and smote the desk a blow that unshipped the cover of the inkpot parsloe you sheep faced shambling exile from hell he cried disgorge that pig immediately my empress added lord emsworth precisely empress of blandings the pig you stole last night sir gregory parsloe parsloe rose slowly from his chair the hon galahad pointed an imperious finger at him but he ignored the gesture his blood pressure was now hovering around the hundred and fifty mark do you mean to tell me that you seriously accuse parsloe sit down sir gregory choked i always knew emsworth that you were as mad as a coot as a what whispered his lordship coot said the hon galahad curtly sort of duck he turned to the defendant again vituperation will do you no good young parsloe we know that you have stolen that pig i haven t stolen any damned pig what would i want to steal a pig for the hon galahad snorted what did you want to nobble my dog towser for in the back room of the black footman in the spring of the year he said to queer the favourite that s why you did it and that s what you re after now trying to queer the favourite again oh we can see through you all right young parsloe we read you like a book sir gregory had stopped worrying about his blood pressure no amount of calm soothing thoughts could do it any good now you re crazy both of you stark staring mad parsloe will you or will you not cough up that pig i have not got your pig that is your last word is it i haven t seen the creature why a coot asked lord emsworth who had been brooding for some time in silence very well said the hon galahad if that is the attitude you propose to adopt there is no course before me but to take steps and i ll tell you the steps i m going to take young parsloe i see now that i have been foolishly indulgent i have allowed my kind heart to get the better of me often and often when i ve been sitting at my desk i ve remembered a good story that simply cried out to be put into my reminiscences and every time i ve said to myself no i ve said that would wound young parsloe good as it is i can t use it i must respect young parsloe s feelings well from now on there will be no more forbearance unless you restore that pig i shall insert in my book every dashed thing i can remember about you starting with our first meeting when i came into romano s and was introduced to you while you were walking round the supper table with a soup tureen on your head and stick of celery in your hand saying that you were a sentry outside buckingham palace the world shall know you for what you are the only man who was ever thrown out of the caf de l europe for trying to raise the price of a bottle of champagne by raffling his trousers at the main bar and what s more i ll tell the full story of the prawns a sharp cry escaped sir gregory his face had turned a deep magenta in these affluent days of his middle age he always looked rather like a regency buck who has done himself well for years among the fleshpots he now resembled a regency buck who in addition to being on the verge of apoplexy has been stung in the leg by a hornet i will said the hon galahad firmly the full true and complete story of the prawns omitting nothing what was the story of the prawns my dear fellow asked lord emsworth interested never mind i know and young parsloe knows and if empress of blandings is not back in her sty this afternoon you will find it in my book but i keep telling you cried the suffering baronet that i know nothing whatever about your pig ha i ve not seen the animal since last year s agricultural show ho i didn t know it had disappeared till you told me the hon galahad stared fixedly at him through the black rimmed monocle then with a gesture of loathing he turned to the door come clarence he said are we going yes said the hon galahad with quiet dignity there is nothing more that we can do here let us get away from this house before it is struck by a thunderbolt iii the gentlemanly office boy who sat in the outer room of the argus enquiry agency read the card which the stout visitor had handed to him and gazed at the stout visitor with respect and admiration a polished lad he loved the aristocracy he tapped on the door of the inner office a gentleman to see me asked percy pilbeam a baronet to see you sir corrected the office boy sir gregory parsloe parsloe matchingham hall salop show him in immediately said pilbeam with enthusiasm he rose and pulled down the lapels of his coat things he felt were looking up he remembered sir gregory parsloe one of his first cases he had been able to recover for him some letters which had fallen into the wrong hands he wondered as he heard the footsteps outside if his client had been indulging in correspondence again from the baronet s sandbagged expression as he entered such might well have been the case it is the fate of sir gregory parsloe parsloe to come into this chronicle puffing and looking purple he puffed and looked purple now i have called to see you mr pilbeam he said after the preliminary civilities had been exchanged and he had lowered his impressive bulk into a chair because i am in a position of serious difficulty i am sorry to hear that sir gregory and because i remember with what discretion and resource you once acted on my behalf pilbeam glanced at the door it was closed he was now convinced that his visitor s little trouble was the same as on that previous occasion and he looked at the indefatigable man with frank astonishment didn t these old bucks he was asking himself ever stop writing compromising letters you would have thought they would get writer s cramp if there is any way in which i can assist you sir gregory perhaps you will tell me the facts from the beginning the beginning sir gregory pondered well let me put it this way at one time mr pilbeam i was younger than i am to day quite poorer no doubt and less respectable and during that period of my life i unfortunately went about a good deal with a man named threepwood galahad threepwood you know him said sir gregory surprised pilbeam chuckled reminiscently i know his name i wrote an article about him once when i was editing a paper called society spice number one of the thriftless aristocrats series the snappiest thing i ever did in my life they tell me he called twice at the office with a horsewhip wanting to see me sir gregory exhibited concern you have met him then i have not you are probably not familiar with the inner workings of a paper like society spice sir gregory but i may tell you that it is foreign to the editorial policy ever to meet visitors who call with horsewhips would he have heard your name no there was a very strict rule in the spice office that the names of the editorial staff were not to be divulged ah said sir gregory relieved his relief gave place to indignation there was an inconsistency about the hon galahad s behaviour which revolted him he cut up rough did he because you wrote things about him in your paper and yet he doesn t seem to mind writing things himself about other people damn him that s quite another matter a different thing altogether oh yes does he write i didn t know he s writing his reminiscences at this very moment he s down at blandings castle finishing them now and the book s going to be full of stories about me that s why i ve come to see you dashed infernal damaging stories which ll ruin my reputation in the county there s one about some prawns words failed sir gregory he sat puffing pilbeam nodded gravely he understood the position now as to what his client expected him to do about it however he remained hazy but if these stories you speak of are libellous what has that got to do with it they re true the greater the truth the greater the oh i know all about that interrupted sir gregory impatiently and a lot of help it s going to be to me a jury could give me the heaviest damages on record and it wouldn t do me a bit of good what about my reputation in the county what about knowing that every damned fool i met was laughing at me behind my back what about the unionist committee i may tell you mr pilbeam apart from any other consideration that i am on the point of being accepted by our local unionist committee as their candidate at the next election and if that old pest s book is published they will drop me like a hot coal now do you understand pilbeam picked up a pen and with it scratched his chin thoughtfully he liked to take an optimistic view with regard to his clients affairs but he could not conceal from himself that sir gregory appeared to be out of luck he is determined to publish this book it s the only object he s got in life the miserable old fossil and he is resolved to include the stories he called on me this morning expressly to tell me so and i caught the next train to london to put the matter in your hands pilbeam scratched his left cheek bone h m he said well in the circumstances i really don t see what is to be done except get hold of the manuscript and destroy it you were about to say exactly that s precisely what i ve come to ask you to do for me pilbeam opened his mouth startled he had not been about to say anything of the kind what he had been intending to remark was that the situation being as described there appeared no course to pursue but to fold the hands set the teeth and await the inevitable disaster like a man and a briton he gazed blankly at this lawless bart baronets are proverbially bad but surely felt percy pilbeam there was no excuse for them to be as bad as all that steal the manuscript only possible way but that s rather a tall order isn t it sir gregory not replied the baronet ingratiatingly for a clever young fellow like you the flattery left pilbeam cold his distant unenthusiastic manner underwent no change however clever a man is he was thinking he can not very well abstract the manuscript of a book of reminiscences from a house unless he is first able to enter that house how could i get into the place i should have thought you would have found a dozen ways not even one pilbeam assured him look how you recovered those letters of mine that was easy you told them you had come to inspect the gas meter i could scarcely go to blandings castle and say i had come to inspect the gas meter and hope to be invited to make a long visit on the strength of it you do not appear to realize sir gregory that the undertaking you suggest would not be a matter of a few minutes i might have to remain in the house for quite a considerable time sir gregory found his companion s attitude damping he was a man who since his accession to the baronetcy and its accompanying wealth had grown accustomed to seeing people jump smartly to it when he issued instructions he became peevish why couldn t you go there as a butler or something percy pilbeam s only reply to this was a tolerant smile he raised the pen and scratched his head with it scarcely feasible he said and again that rather pitying smile flitted across his face the sight of it brought sir gregory to the boil he felt an irresistible desire to say something to wipe it away it reminded him of the smiles he had seen on the faces of bookmakers in his younger days when he had suggested backing horses with them on credit and in a spirit of mutual trust well have it your own way he snapped but it may interest you to know that to get that manuscript into my possession i am willing to pay a thousand pounds it did as he had foreseen interest pilbeam extremely so much so that in his emotion he jerked the pen wildly inflicting a nasty scalp wound a thuth he stammered sir gregory a prudent man in money matters perceived that he had allowed his sense of the dramatic to carry him away well five hundred he said rather quickly and five hundred pounds is a lot of money mr pilbeam the point was one which he had no need to stress percy pilbeam had grasped it without assistance and his face grew wan with thought the day might come when the proprietor of the argus enquiry agency would remain unmoved by the prospect of adding five hundred pounds to his bank balance but it had not come yet a check for five hundred the moment that old weasel s manuscript is in my hands said sir gregory insinuatingly nature had so arranged it that in no circumstances could percy pilbeam s face ever become really beautiful but at this moment there stole into it an expression which did do something to relieve to a certain extent its normal unpleasantness it was an expression of rapture of joy of almost beatific happiness the look in short of a man who sees his way clear to laying his hands on five hundred pounds there is about the mention of any substantial sum of money something that seems to exercise a quickening effect on the human intelligence a moment before pilbeam s mind had been an inert mass now abruptly it began to function like a dynamo get into blandings castle why of course he could get into blandings castle and not sneak in either with a trousers seat itching in apprehension of the kick that should send him out again but bowl proudly up to the front door in his two seater and hand his suitcase to the butler and be welcomed as the honoured guest until now he had forgotten for he had deliberately set himself to forget the outrageous suggestion of that young idiot whose name escaped him that he should come to blandings and hunt about for lost pigs it had wounded his self respect so deeply at the time that he had driven it from his thoughts when he had found himself thinking about hugo he had immediately pulled himself together and started thinking about something else now it all came back to him and hugo s parting words he recalled had been that if ever he changed his mind the commission would still be open i will take this case sir gregory he said woof you may rely on my being at blandings castle by to morrow evening at the latest i have thought of a way of getting there he rose from his desk and paced the room with knitted brows that agile brain had begun to work under its own steam he paused once to look in a distrait manner out of the window and when sir gregory cleared his throat to speak jerked an impatient shoulder at him he could not have baronets even with hyphens in their names interrupting him at a moment like this sir gregory he said at length the great thing in matters like this is to be prepared with a plan i have a plan woof said sir gregory this time he meant that he had thought all along that his companion would get one after pacing like that when you arrive home i want you to invite mr galahad threepwood to dinner to morrow night the baronet shook like a jelly wrath and amazement fought within him ask the man to dinner after what had occurred as many others of the blandings castle party as you think fit of course but mr threepwood without fail once he is out of the house my path will be clear wrath and amazement died away the baronet had grasped the idea the beauty and simplicity of the stratagem stirred his admiration but was it not he felt a simpler matter to issue such an invitation than to get it accepted a vivid picture rose before his eyes of the hon galahad as he had last seen him then there came to him the blessed healing thought of lady constance keeble he would send the invitation to her and yes dash it he would tell her the full facts put his cards on the table and trust to her sympathy and proper feeling to enlist her in the cause he had long been aware that her attitude towards the reminiscences resembled his own he could rely on her to help him he could also rely on her somehow by what strange feminine modes of coercion he being a bachelor could only guess at to deliver the hon galahad threepwood at matchingham hall in time for dinner women he knew had this strange power over their near relations splendid he said excellent capital woof i ll see it s done then you can leave the rest to me you think if i can get him out of the house you will be able to secure the manuscript certainly sir gregory rose and extended a trembling hand mr pilbeam he said with deep feeling coming to see you was the wisest thing i ever did in my life quite said percy pilbeam chapter viii having reread the half dozen pages which he had written since luncheon the hon galahad threepwood attached them with a brass paper fastener to the main body of his monumental work and placed the manuscript in its drawer lovingly like a young mother putting her first born to bed the day s work was done rising from the desk he yawned and stretched himself he was ink stained but cheerful happiness as solid thinkers have often pointed out comes from giving pleasure to others and the little anecdote that he had just committed to paper would he knew give great pleasure to a considerable number of his fellow men all over england they would be rolling out of their seats when they read it true their enjoyment might possibly not be shared to its fullest extent by sir gregory parsloe parsloe of matchingham hall for what the hon galahad had just written was the story of the prawns but the first lesson an author has to learn is that he can not please everybody he left the small library which he had commandeered as a private study and descending the broad staircase observed beach in the hall below the butler was standing mountainously beside the tea table staring in a sort of trance at a plateful of anchovy sandwiches and it struck the hon galahad not for the first time in the last few days that he appeared to have something on his mind a strained haunted look he seemed to have as if he had done a murder and was afraid somebody was going to find the body a more practised physiognomist would have been able to interpret that look it was the one that butlers always wear when they have allowed themselves to be persuaded against their better judgment into becoming accessories before the fact in the theft of their employers pigs beach he said speaking over the banisters for he had just remembered that there was a question he wanted to ask the man about the somewhat eccentric major general magnus in whose employment he had once been what s the matter with you he added with some irritation for the butler jerked from his reverie had jumped a couple of inches and shaken all over in a manner that was most trying to watch a butler felt the hon galahad is a butler and a startled fawn is a startled fawn he disliked the blend of the two in a single body why on earth do you spring like that when anyone speaks to you i ve noticed it before he leaps he said complainingly to his niece millicent who now came down the stairs with slow listless steps when addressed he quivers like a harpooned whale oh said millicent dully she had drooped into a chair and picked up a book she looked like something that might have occurred to ibsen in one of his less frivolous moments i am extremely sorry mr galahad no use being sorry thing is not to do it if you are practising the shimmy for the servants ball be advised by an old friend and give it up you haven t the build i think i may have caught a chill sir take a stiff whisky toddy put you right in no time what s the car doing out there her ladyship ordered it sir i understand that she and mr baxter are going to market blandings to meet the train arriving at four forty somebody expected the american young lady sir miss schoonmaker of course yes i remember she arrives to day does she yes sir schoonmaker i used to know old johnny schoonmaker well a great fellow mixed the finest mint juleps in america have you ever tasted a mint julep beach not to my recollection sir oh you d remember all right if you had insidious things they creep up to you like a baby sister and slide their little hands into yours and the next thing you know the judge is telling you to pay the clerk of the court fifty dollars seen lord emsworth anywhere his lordship is at the telephone sir don t do it i tell you said the hon galahad petulantly for once again the butler had been affected by what appeared to be a kind of palsy i beg your pardon mr galahad it was something i was suddenly reminded of there was a gentleman just after luncheon who desired to communicate with you on the telephone i understood him to say that he was speaking from oxford being on his way from london to blackpool in his automobile knowing that you were occupied with your literary work i refrained from disturbing you and till i mentioned the word telephone the matter slipped my mind who was he i did not get the gentleman s name sir the wire was faulty but he desired me to inform you that his business had to do with a dramatic entertainment a play yes sir said beach plainly impressed by this happy way of putting it i took the liberty of advising him that you might be able to see him later in the afternoon he said that he would call after tea the butler passed from the hall with heavy haunted steps and the hon galahad turned to his niece i know who it is he said he wrote to me yesterday it s a theatrical manager fellow i used to go about with years ago man named mason he s got a play adapted from the french and he s had the idea of changing it into the period of the nineties and getting me to put my name to it oh on the strength of my book coming out at the same time not a bad notion either galahad threepwood s a name that s going to have box office value pretty soon the house ll be sold out for weeks to all the old buffers who ll come flocking up to london to see if i ve put anything about them into it oh said millicent the hon galahad frowned he sensed a lack of interest and sympathy what s the matter with you he demanded nothing then why are you looking like that like what pale and tragic as if you d just gone into tattersall s and met a bookie you owed money to i am perfectly happy the hon galahad snorted yes radiant i ve seen fogs that were cheerier what s that book you re reading it belongs to aunt constance millicent glanced wanly at the cover it seems to be about theosophy theosophy fancy a young girl in the springtime of life what the devil has happened to everybody in this house there s some excuse perhaps for clarence if you admit the possibility of a sane man getting so attached to a beastly pig he has a right to be upset but what s wrong with all the rest of you ronald goes about behaving like a bereaved tomato beach springs up and down when you speak to him and that young fellow carmody i am not interested in mr carmody this morning said the hon galahad aggrieved i told that boy one of the most humorous limericks i ever heard in my life about an old man of however that is neither here nor there and he just gaped at me with his jaw dropping like a spavined horse looking over a fence there are mysteries afoot in this house and i don t like em the atmosphere of blandings castle has changed all of a sudden from that of a normal happy english home into something edgar allan poe might have written on a rainy sunday it s getting on my nerves let s hope this girl of johnny schoonmaker s will cheer us up if she s anything like her father she ought to be a nice lively girl but i suppose when she arrives it ll turn out that she s in mourning for a great aunt or brooding over the situation in russia or something i don t know what young people are coming to nowadays gloomy introspective the old gay spirit seems to have died out altogether in my young days a girl of your age would have been upstairs making an apple pie bed for somebody instead of lolling on chairs reading books about theosophy snorting once more the hon galahad disappeared into the smoking room and millicent tight lipped returned to her book she had been reading for some minutes when she became aware of a long limp drooping figure at her side hullo said hugo for this ruin of a fine young man was he millicent s ear twitched but she did not reply reading said hugo he had been standing on his left leg with a sudden change of policy he now shifted and stood on his right interesting book millicent looked up i beg your pardon only said is that an interesting book very said millicent hugo decided that his right leg was not a success he stood on his left again what s it about transmigration of souls a thing i m not very well up on one of the many i should imagine said the haughty girl every day you seem to know less and less about more and more she rose and made for the stairs her manner suggested that she was disappointed in the hall of blandings castle she had supposed it a nice place for a girl to sit and study the best literature and now it appeared it was overrun by the underworld if you re really anxious to know what transmigration means it s simply that some people believe that when you die your soul goes into something else rum idea said hugo becoming more buoyant he began to draw hope from her chattiness she had not said as many consecutive words as this to him for quite a time into something else eh odd notion what do you suppose made them think of that yours for instance would probably go into a pig and then i would come along and look into your sty and i d say good gracious why there s hugo carmody he hasn t changed a bit the spirit of the carmodys had been a good deal crushed by recent happenings but at this it flickered into feeble life i call that a beastly thing to say do you yes i do i oughtn t to have said it no you oughtn t well i wouldn t have if i could have thought of anything worse and when you let a little thing like what happened the other night rot up a great love like ours i well i call it a bit rotten you know perfectly well that you re the only girl in the world i ever shall i tell you something what you make me sick hugo breathed passionately through his nose so all is over is it you can jolly well bet all is over and if you re interested in my future plans i may mention i intend to marry the first man who comes along and asks me and you can be a page at the wedding if you like you couldn t look any sillier than you do now even in a frilly shirt and satin knickerbockers hugo laughed raspingly is that so it is and once you said there wasn t another man like me in the world well i should hate to think there was said millicent and as the celebrated james thomas beach procession had entered with cakes and gate leg tables and her last word seemed about as good a last word as a girl might reasonably consider herself entitled to she passed proudly up the stairs james withdrew thomas withdrew beach remained gazing with a hypnotized eye at the cake beach said hugo sir curse all women very good sir said beach he watched the young man disappear through the open front door heard his footsteps crunch on the gravel and gave himself up to meditation again how gladly he was thinking if it had not been for upsetting mr ronald s plans would he have breathed in his employer s ear as he filled his glass at dinner the pig is in the gamekeeper s cottage in the west wood your lordship thank you your lordship but it was not to be his face twisted as if with sudden pain and he was aware of the hon galahad emerging from the smoking room just remembered something i wanted to ask you beach you were with old general magnus weren t you some years ago before you came here yes mr galahad then perhaps you can tell me the exact facts about that trouble in i know the old chap chased young mandeville three times round the lawn in his pajamas but did he merely try to stab him with the bread knife or did he actually get home i could not say sir he did not honour me with his confidence infernal nuisance said the hon galahad i like to get these things right he eyed the butler discontentedly as he retired more than ever was he convinced that the fellow had something on his mind the very way he walked showed it he was about to return to the smoking room when his brother clarence came into the hall and there was in lord emsworth s bearing so strange a gaiety that he stood transfixed it seemed to the hon galahad years since he had seen anyone looking cheerful in blandings castle good god clarence what s happened what my dear fellow you re wreathed in smiles dash it and skipping like the high hills found that pig under the drawing room sofa or something lord emsworth beamed i have had the most cheering piece of news galahad that detective the one i sent young carmody to see the argus man you know he has come after all he drove down in his car and is at this moment in market blandings at the emsworth arms i have been speaking to him on the telephone he rang up to ask if i still required his services well you don t certainly i do galahad i consider his presence vital he can t tell you any more than you know already there s only one man who can have stolen that pig and that s young parsloe precisely yes quite true but this man will be able to collect evidence and bring the thing home and er bring it home he has the trained mind i consider it most important that the case should be in the hands of a man with a trained mind we should be seeing him very shortly he is having what he describes as a bit of a snack at the emsworth arms when he has finished he will drive over i am delighted ah constance my dear lady constance keeble attended by the efficient baxter had appeared at the foot of the stairs his lordship eyed her a little warily the chatelaine of blandings was apt sometimes to react unpleasantly to the information that visitors not invited by herself were expected at the castle constance my dear a friend of mine is arriving this evening to spend a few days i forgot to tell you well we have plenty of room for him replied lady constance with surprising amiability there is something i forgot to tell you too we are dining at matchingham to night matchingham lord emsworth was puzzled he could think of no one who lived in the village of matchingham except sir gregory parsloe parsloe with whom sir gregory of course who else do you suppose it could be what i had a note from him after luncheon it is short notice of course but that doesn t matter in the country he took it for granted that we would not be engaged constance lord emsworth swelled slightly constance i will not dash it i will not dine with that man and that s final lady constance smiled a sort of lion tamer s smile she had foreseen a reaction of this kind she had expected sales resistance and was prepared to cope with it not readily she knew would her brother become parsloe conscious please do not be absurd clarence i thought you would say that i have already accepted for you galahad myself and millicent you may as well understand at once that i do not intend to be on bad terms with our nearest neighbour even if a hundred of your pig men leave you and go to him your attitude in the matter has been perfectly childish from the very start if sir gregory realizes that there has been a coolness and has most sensibly decided to make the first move toward a reconciliation we can not possibly refuse the overture indeed and what about my friend arriving this evening he can look after himself for a few hours i should imagine abominable rudeness he ll think it this line of attack had occurred to lord emsworth quite suddenly he found it good almost an inspiration it seemed to him i invite my friend pilbeam here to pay us a visit and the moment he arrives we meet him at the front door dash it and say ah here you are pilbeam well amuse yourself pilbeam we re off and this miss er this american girl what will she think did you say pilbeam asked the hon galahad it is no use talking clarence dinner is at eight and please see that your dress clothes are nicely pressed ring for beach and tell him now last night you looked like a scarecrow once and for all i tell you at this moment an unexpected ally took the arena on lady constance s side of course we must go clarence said the hon galahad and lord emsworth spinning round to face this flank attack was surprised to see a swift meaning wink come and go on his brother s face nothing gained by having unpleasantness with your neighbours in the country always a mistake never pays exactly said lady constance a little dazed at finding this saul among the prophets but glad of the helping hand in the country one is quite dependent on one s neighbours and young parsloe not such a bad chap clarence lots of good in parsloe we shall have a pleasant evening i am relieved to find that you at any rate have sense galahad said lady constance handsomely i will leave you to try and drive some of it into clarence s head come mr baxter we shall be late the sound of the car s engine had died away before lord emsworth s feelings found relief in speech but galahad my dear fellow the hon galahad patted his shoulder reassuringly it s all right clarence my boy i know what i m doing i have the situation well in hand dine with parsloe after what has occurred after what occurred yesterday it s impossible why on earth the man is inviting us i can t understand i suppose he thinks that if he gives us a dinner i shall relent and omit the prawn story oh i see parsloe s motive all right a clever move not that it ll work but what do you want to go for the hon galahad raked the hall with a conspiratorial monocle it appeared to be empty nevertheless he looked under a settee and going to the front door swiftly scanned the gravel shall i tell you something clarence he said coming back something that ll interest you certainly my dear fellow certainly most decidedly something that ll bring the sparkle to your eyes by all means i should enjoy it you know what we re going to do to night after dining with parsloe and sending constance back in the car no the hon galahad placed his lips to his brother s ear we re going to steal his pig my boy what it came to me in a flash while constance was talking parsloe stole the empress very well we ll steal pride of matchingham then we ll be in a position to look young parsloe squarely in the eye and say what about it lord emsworth swayed gently his brain never a strong one had tottered perceptibly on its throne galahad only thing to do reprisals recognized military man uvre but how galahad how can it be done easily if young parsloe stole the empress why should we have any difficulty in stealing his animal you show me where he keeps it my boy and i ll do the rest puffy benger and i stole old wivenhoe s pig at hammers easton in the year we put it in plug basham s bedroom and we ll put parsloe s pig in a bedroom too in a bedroom well a sort of bedroom where are we to hide the animal that s what you ve been asking yourself is it i ll tell you we re going to put it in that caravan that your flower pot throwing friend baxter arrived in nobody s going to think of looking there then we ll be in a position to talk terms to young parsloe and i think he will very soon see the game is up lord emsworth was looking at his brother almost devoutly he had always known that galahad s intelligence was superior to his own but he had never realized it could soar to quite such lofty heights as this it was he supposed the result of the life his brother had lived he himself sheltered through the peaceful uneventful years at blandings castle had allowed his brain to become comparatively atrophied but galahad battling through these same years with hostile skittle sharps and the sort of man that used to be a member of the old pelican club had kept his clear and vigorous you really think it would be feasible trust me by the way clarence this man pilbeam of yours do you know if he was ever anything except a detective i have no idea my dear fellow i know nothing of him i have merely spoken to him on the telephone why oh nothing i ll ask him when he arrives where are you going into the garden it s raining i have my mackintosh i really i feel i really must walk about after what you have told me i am in a state of considerable excitement well work it off before you see constance again it won t do to have her start suspecting there s something up if there s anything you want to ask me about you ll find me in the smoking room for some twenty minutes the hall of blandings castle remained empty then beach appeared at the same moment from the gravel outside there came the purring of a high powered car and the sound of voices beach posed himself in the doorway looking as he always did on these occasions like the spirit of blandings welcoming the lucky guest chapter ix leave the door open beach said lady constance very good your ladyship i think the smell of the wet earth and the flowers is so refreshing don t you the butler did not he was not one of your fresh air men rightly conjecturing however that the question had been addressed not to him but to the girl in the beige suit who had accompanied the speaker up the steps he forbore to reply he cast an appraising bulging eyed look at this girl and decided that she met with his approval smaller and slighter than the type of woman he usually admired he found her nevertheless even by his own exacting standards of criticism noticeably attractive he liked her face and he liked the way she was dressed her frock was right her shoes were right her stockings were right and her hat was right as far as beach was concerned sue had passed the censor her demeanour pleased him too from the flush on her face and the sparkle in her eyes she seemed to be taking her first entry into blandings castle in quite the proper spirit of reverential excitement to be at blandings plainly meant something to her was an event in her life and beach who after many years of residence within its walls had come to look on the castle as a piece of personal property felt flattered and gratified i don t think this shower will last long said lady constance no said sue smiling brightly and now you must be wanting some tea after your journey yes said sue smiling brightly it seemed to her that she had been smiling brightly for centuries the moment she had alighted from the train and found her formidable hostess and this strangely sinister mr baxter waiting to meet her on the platform she had begun to smile brightly and had been doing it ever since usually we have tea on the lawn it is so nice there it must be when the rain is over mr baxter you must show miss schoonmaker the rose garden i shall be delighted said the efficient baxter he flashed gleaming spectacles in her direction and a momentary panic gripped sue she feared that already this man had probed her secret in his glance it seemed to her there shone suspicion such however was not the case it was only the combination of large spectacles and heavy eyebrows that had created the illusion although rupert baxter was a man who generally suspected everybody on principle it so happened that he had accepted sue without question the glance was an admiring almost a loving glance it would be too much to say that baxter had already fallen a victim to sue s charms but the good looks which he saw and the wealth which he had been told about were undeniably beginning to fan the hidden fire my brother is a great rose grower yes isn t he i mean i think roses are so lovely the spectacles were beginning to sap sue s morale they seemed to be eating into her soul like some sort of corrosive acid how nice and old everything is here she went on hurriedly what is that funny looking gargoyle thing over there what she actually referred to was a japanese mask which hung from the wall and it was unfortunate that the hon galahad should have chosen this moment to come out of the smoking room it made the question seem personal my brother galahad said lady constance her voice lost some of the kindly warmth of the hostess putting the guest at her ease and took on the cold disapproval which the author of the reminiscences always induced in her galahad this is miss schoonmaker really the hon galahad trotted briskly up is it bless my soul well well well how do you do said sue smiling brightly how are you my dear i know your father intimately the bright smile faded sue had tried to plan this venture of hers carefully looking ahead for all possible pitfalls but that she would encounter people who knew mr schoonmaker intimately she had not foreseen haven t seen him lately of course let me see must be twenty five years since we met yes quite twenty five years a warm and lasting friendship was destined to spring up between sue and the hon galahad threepwood but never in the whole course of it did she experience again quite the gush of whole hearted affection which surged over her at these words i wasn t born then she said the hon galahad was babbling on happily a great fellow old johnny you ll find some stories about him in my book i m writing my reminiscences you know fine sportsman old johnny great grief to him i remember when he broke his leg and had to go into a nursing home in the middle of the racing season however he made the best of it got the nurses interested in current form and used to make a book with them in fruit and cigarettes and things i recollect coming to see him one day and finding him quite worried he was a most conscientious man with a horror of not settling up when he lost and apparently one of the girls had had a suet dumpling on the winner of the three o clock race at fifteen to eight and he couldn t figure out what he had got to pay her sue laughing gratefully was aware of a drooping presence at her side my niece millicent said lady constance millicent my dear this is miss schoonmaker how do you do said sue smiling brightly how do you do said millicent like the silent tomb breaking its silence sue regarded her with interest so this was hugo s millicent the sight of her caused sue to wonder at the ardent nature of that young man s devotion millicent was pretty but she would have thought that one of hugo s exuberant disposition would have preferred something a little livelier she was startled to observe in the girl s eyes a look of surprise in a situation as delicate as hers was sue had no wish to occasion surprise to anyone ronnie s friend asked millicent the miss schoonmaker ronnie met at biarritz yes said sue faintly but i had the impression that you were very tall i m sure ronnie told me so i suppose almost anyone seems tall to that boy said the hon galahad sue breathed again she had had a return of the unpleasant feeling of being boneless which had come upon her when the hon galahad had spoken of knowing mr schoonmaker intimately but though she breathed she was still shaken life at blandings castle was plainly going to be a series of shocks she sat back with a sensation of dizziness baxter s spectacles seemed to her to be glittering more suspiciously than ever have you seen ronald anywhere millicent asked lady constance not since lunch i suppose he s out in the grounds somewhere i saw him half an hour ago said the hon galahad he came mooning along under my window while i was polishing up some stuff i wrote this afternoon i called to him but he just grunted and wandered off he will be surprised to find you here said lady constance turning to sue your telegram did not arrive till after lunch so he does not know that you were planning to come to day unless you told him galahad i didn t tell him never occurred to me that he knew miss schoonmaker forgot you d met him at biarritz what was he like then reasonably cheerful yes i think so didn t scowl and jump and gasp and quiver all over the place no then something must have happened when he went up to london it was after he came back that i remember noticing that he seemed upset about something ah the rain s stopped lady constance looked over her shoulder the sky still looks very threatening she said but you might be able to get out for a few minutes mr baxter she explained is going to show miss schoonmaker the rose garden no he isn t said the hon galahad who had been scrutinizing sue through his monocle with growing appreciation i am old johnny schoonmaker s little girl why there are a hundred things i want to discuss the last thing sue desired was to be left alone with the intimidating baxter she rose quickly i should love to come she said the prospect of discussing the intimate affairs of the schoonmaker family was not an agreeable one but anything was better than the society of the spectacles perhaps said the hon galahad as he led her to the door you ll be able to put me right about that business of old johnny and the mysterious woman at the new year s eve party as i got the story johnny suddenly found this female a perfect stranger mind you with her arms round his neck telling him in a confidential undertone that she had made up her mind to go straight back to des moines iowa and stick a knife into fred what he had done to win her confidence and who fred was and whether she ever did stick a knife into him your father hadn t found out by the time i left for home his voice died away and a moment later the efficient baxter starting as if a sudden thought had entered his powerful brain rose abruptly and made quickly for the stairs chapter x i the rose garden of blandings castle was a famous beauty spot most people who visited it considered it deserving of a long and leisurely inspection enthusiastic horticulturists frequently went pottering and sniffing about it for hours on end the tour through its fragrant groves personally conducted by the hon galahad threepwood lasted some six minutes well that s what it is you see he said as they emerged waving a hand vaguely roses and er roses and all that sort of thing you get the idea and now if you don t mind i ought to be getting back i want to keep in touch with the house it slipped my mind but i m expecting a man to call to see me at any moment on some rather important business sue was quite willing to return she liked her companion but she had found his company embarrassing the subject of the schoonmaker family history showed a tendency to bulk too largely in his conversation for comfort fortunately his practice of asking a question and answering it himself and then rambling off into some anecdote of the person or persons involved had enabled her so far to avoid disaster but there was no saying how long this happy state of things would last she was glad of the opportunity of being alone besides ronnie was somewhere out in these grounds at any moment if she went wandering through them she might come upon him and then she told herself all would be well surely he could not preserve his sullen hostility in the face of the fact that she had come all this way pretending dangerously to be miss schoonmaker of new york simply in order to see him her companion she found was still talking he wants to see me about a play this book of mine is going to make a stir you see and he thinks that if he can get me to put my name to the play sue s thoughts wandered again she gathered that the caller he was expecting had to do with the theatrical industry and wondered for a moment if it was anyone she had ever heard of she was not sufficiently interested to make inquiries she was too busy thinking of ronnie i shall be quite happy she said as the voice beside her ceased it s such a lovely place i shall enjoy just wandering about by myself the hon galahad seemed shocked at the idea wouldn t dream of leaving you alone clarence will look after you and i shall be back in a few minutes the name seemed to sue to strike a familiar chord then she remembered lord emsworth ronnie s uncle clarence the man who held ronnie s destinies in the hollow of his hand hi clarence called the hon galahad sue perceived pottering toward them a long stringy man of mild and benevolent aspect she was conscious of something of a shock in ronnie s conversation the earl of emsworth had always appeared in the light of a sort of latter day ogre a man at whom the stoutest nephew might well shudder she saw nothing formidable in this newcomer is that lord emsworth she asked surprised yes clarence this is miss schoonmaker his lordship had pottered up and was beaming amiably is it indeed oh ah yes to be sure delighted how are you how are you miss who schoonmaker daughter of my old friend johnny schoonmaker you knew she was arriving considering that you were in the hall when constance went to meet her oh yes the cloud was passing from what for want of a better word must be called lord emsworth s mind yes yes yes yes to be sure i ve got to leave you to look after her for a few minutes clarence certainly certainly take her about and show her things i wouldn t go too far from the house if i were you there s a storm coming up exactly precisely yes i will take her about and show her things are you fond of pigs sue had never considered this point before hers had been an urban life and she could not remember ever having come into contact with a pig on what might be termed a social footing but remembering that this was the man whom ronnie had described as being wrapped up in one of these animals she smiled her bright smile oh yes very mine has been stolen i m so sorry lord emsworth was visibly pleased at this womanly sympathy but i now have strong hopes that she may be recovered the trained mind is everything what i always say what it was that lord emsworth always said was unfortunately destined to remain unrevealed it would probably have been something good but the world was not to hear it for at this moment completely breaking his train of thought there came from above from the direction of the window of the small library an odd scrabbling sound something shot through the air and the next instant there appeared in the middle of a flower bed containing lobelias something that was so manifestly not a lobelia that he stared at it in stunned amazement speech wiped from his lips as with a sponge it was the efficient baxter he was on all fours and seemed to be groping about for his spectacles which had fallen off and got hidden in the undergrowth ii properly considered there is no such thing as an insoluble mystery it may seem puzzling at first sight when ex secretaries start falling as the gentle rain from heaven upon the lobelias beneath but there is always a reason for it that baxter did not immediately give the reason was due to the fact that he had private and personal motives for not doing so we have called rupert baxter efficient and efficient he was the word as we interpret it implies not only a capacity for performing the ordinary tasks of life with a smooth firmness of touch but in addition a certain alertness of mind a genius for opportunism a gift for seeing clearly thinking swiftly and doing it now with these qualities rupert baxter was pre minently equipped and it had been with him the work of a moment to perceive directly the hon galahad had left the house with sue that here was his chance of popping upstairs nipping into the small library and abstracting the manuscript of the reminiscences having popped and nipped as planned he was in the very act of searching the desk when the sound of a footstep outside froze him from his spectacles to the soles of his feet the next moment fingers began to turn the door handle you may freeze a baxter s body but you can not numb his active brain with one masterful lightning like flash of clear thinking he took in the situation and saw the only possible way out to reach the door leading to the large library he would have to circumnavigate the desk the window on the other hand was at his elbow so he jumped out of it all these things baxter could have explained in a few words refraining from doing so he rose to his feet and began to brush the mould from his knees baxter what on earth the ex secretary found the gaze of his late employer trying to nerves which had been considerably shaken by his fall the occasions on which he disliked lord emsworth most intensely were just these occasions when the other gaped at him open mouthed like a surprised halibut i overbalanced he said curtly overbalanced slipped slipped yes slipped how where it now occurred to baxter that by a most fortunate chance the window of the small library was not the only one that looked out onto this arena into which he had precipitated himself he might equally well have descended from the larger library which adjoined it i was leaning out of the library window why inhaling the air what for and i lost my balance lost your balance i slipped slipped baxter had the feeling it was one which he had often had in the old days when conversing with lord emsworth that an exchange of remarks had begun which might go on forever a keen desire swept over him to be and that right speedily in some other place he did not care where it was so long as lord emsworth was not there it would be paradise enow i think i will go indoors and wash my hands he said and face suggested the hon galahad my face also said rupert baxter coldly he started to move round the angle of the house but long before he had got out of hearing lord emsworth s high and penetrating tenor was dealing with the situation his lordship as so often happened on these occasions was under the impression that he spoke in a hushed whisper mad as a coot he said and the words rang out through the still summer air like a public oration they cut baxter to the quick they were not the sort of words to which a man with an inch and a quarter of skin off his left shin bone ought ever to have been called upon to listen with flushed ears and glowing spectacles the efficient baxter passed on his way statistics relating to madness among coots are not to hand but we may safely doubt whether even in the ranks of these notoriously unbalanced birds there could have been found at this moment one who was feeling half as mad as he was iii lord emsworth continued to gaze at the spot where his late secretary had passed from sight mad as a coot he repeated in his brother galahad he found a ready supporter madder said the hon galahad upon my word i think he s actually worse than he was two years ago then at least he never fell out of windows why on earth do you have that fellow here lord emsworth sighed it s constance my dear galahad you know what she is she insisted on inviting him well if you take my advice you ll hide the flower pots one of the things this fellow does when he gets these attacks explained the hon galahad taking sue into the family confidence is to go about hurling flower pots at people really said sue i assure you looking for me beach the careworn figure of the butler had appeared walking as one pacing behind the coffin of an old friend yes sir the gentleman has arrived mr galahad i looked in the small library thinking that you might possibly be there but you were not no i was out here yes sir that s why you couldn t find me show him up to the small library beach and tell him i ll be with him in a moment very good sir the hon galahad s temporary delay in going to see his visitor was due to his desire to linger long enough to tell sue to whom he had taken a warm fancy and whom he wished to shield as far as it was in his power from the perils of life what every girl ought to know about the efficient baxter never let yourself be alone with that fellow in a deserted spot my dear he counselled if he suggests a walk in the woods call for help been off his head for years ask clarence lord emsworth nodded solemnly and it looks to me went on the hon galahad as if his mania had now taken a suicidal turn overbalanced indeed how the deuce could he have overbalanced flung himself out bodily that s what he did i couldn t think who it was he reminded me of till this moment he s the living image of a man i used to know in the nineties the first intimation any of us had that this chap had anything wrong with him was when he turned up to supper at the house of a friend of mine george pallant you remember george clarence with a couple of days beard on him and when mrs george who had known him all her life asked him why he hadn t shaved shaved says this fellow surprised packleby his name was one of the leicestershire packlebys shaved dear lady he says well considering that they even hide the butter knife when i come down to breakfast for fear i ll try to cut my throat with it is it reasonable to suppose they d trust me with a razor quite stuffy about it he was and it spoiled the party look after miss schoonmaker clarence i shan t be long lord emsworth had little experience in the art of providing diversion for young girls left thus to his native inspiration he pondered a while if the empress had not been stolen his task would of course have been simple he could have given this miss schoonmaker a half hour of sheer entertainment by taking her down to the piggeries to watch that superb animal feed as it was he was at something of a loss perhaps you would care to see the rose garden he hazarded i should love it said sue are you fond of roses tremendously lord emsworth found himself warming to this girl her personality pleased him he seemed dimly to recall something his sister constance had said about her something about wishing that her nephew ronald would settle down with some nice girl with money like that miss schoonmaker whom julia had met at biarritz feeling so kindly toward her it occurred to him that a word in season opening her eyes to his nephew s true character might prevent the girl making a mistake which she would regret forever when it was too late i think you know my nephew ronald he said yes lord emsworth paused to smell a rose he gave sue a brief biography of it before returning to the theme that boy s an ass he said why said sue sharply she began to feel less amiable toward this stringy old man a moment before she had been thinking that it was rather charming that funny vague manner of his now she saw him clearly for what he was a dodderer and a class a dodderer at that why his lordship considered the point well heredity probably i should say his father old miles fish was the biggest fool in the brigade of guards he looked at her impressively through slanting pince nez as if to call her attention to the fact that this was something of an achievement the boy throws tennis balls at pigs he went on getting down to the ghastly facts sue was surprised the words if she had caught them correctly seemed to present a side of ronnie s character of which she had been unaware does what i saw him with my own eyes he threw a tennis ball at empress of blandings and not once but repeatedly the motherly instinct which all girls feel toward the men they love urged sue to say something in ronnie s defence but apart from suggesting that the pig had probably started it she could not think of anything they left the rose garden and began to walk back to the lawn lord emsworth still exercised by the thought of his nephew s shortcomings for one reason and another ronnie had always been a source of vague annoyance to him since boyhood there had even been times when he had felt that he would almost have preferred the society of his younger son frederick aggravating boy he said most aggravating always up to something or other started a night club the other day lost a lot of money over it just the sort of thing he would do my brother galahad started some kind of a club many years ago it cost my old father nearly a thousand pounds i recollect there is something about ronald that reminds me very much of galahad at the same age although sue had found much in the author of the reminiscences to attract her she was able to form a very fair estimate of the sort of young man he must have been in the middle twenties this charge accordingly struck her as positively libellous i don t agree with you lord emsworth but you never knew my brother galahad as a young man his lordship pointed out cleverly what is the name of that hill over there asked sue in a cold voice changing the unpleasant subject that hill oh that one it was the only one in sight it is called the wrekin oh said sue yes said lord emsworth ah said sue they had crossed the lawn and were on the broad terraces that looked out over the park sue leaned on the low stone wall that bordered it and gazed before her into the gathering dusk the castle had been built on a knoll of rising ground and on this terrace one had the illusion of being perched up at a great height from where she stood sue got a sweeping view of the park and of the dim misty vale of blandings that dreamed beyond in the park rabbits were scuttling to and fro in the shrubberies birds called sleepily from somewhere out across the fields there came the faint tinkling of sheep bells the lake shone like old silver and there was a river in the distance dull gray between the dull green of the trees it was a lovely sight age old orderly and english but it was spoiled by the sky the sky was overcast and looked bruised it seemed to be made of dough and one could fancy it pressing down on the world like a heavy blanket and it was muttering to itself a single heavy drop of rain splashed on the stone beside sue and there was a low growl far away as if some powerful and unfriendly beast had spied her she shivered she had been gripped by a sudden depression a strange foreboding that chilled the spirit that muttering seemed to say that there was no happiness anywhere and never could be any the air was growing close and clammy another drop of rain fell squashily like a toad and spread itself over her hand lord emsworth was finding his companion unresponsive his stream of prattle slackened and died away he began to wonder how he was to escape from a girl who though undeniably pleasing to the eye was proving singularly difficult to talk to raking the horizon in search of aid he perceived beach approaching a silver salver in his hand the salver had a card on it and an envelope for me beach the card your lordship the gentleman is in the hall lord emsworth breathed a sigh of relief you will excuse me my dear it is most important that i should see this fellow immediately my brother galahad will be back very shortly i have no doubt he will entertain you you don t mind he bustled away glad to go and sue became conscious of the salver thrust deferentially toward her for you miss for me yes miss moaned beach like a winter wind wailing through dead trees he inclined his head sombrely and was gone she tore open the envelope for one breath taking instant she had thought it might be from ronnie but the writing was not ronnie s familiar scrawl it was bold clear decisive writing the writing of an efficient man she looked at the last page yours sincerely r j baxter sue s heart was beating faster as she turned back to the beginning when a girl in the position in which she had placed herself has been stared at through steel rimmed spectacles in the way this r j baxter had stared at her through his spectacles her initial reaction to mysterious notes from the man behind the lenses can not but be a panic fear that all has been discovered the opening sentence dispelled her alarm purely personal motives it appeared had caused rupert baxter to write these few lines the mere fact that the letter began with the words dear miss schoonmaker was enough in itself to bring comfort at the risk of annoying you by the intrusion of my private affairs wrote the efficient baxter rather in the manner of one beginning an after dinner speech i feel that i must give you an explanation of the incident which occurred in the garden in your presence this afternoon from the observation in the grossest taste which lord emsworth let fall in my hearing i fear you may have placed a wrong construction on what took place i allude to the expression mad as a coot which i distinctly heard lord emsworth utter as i moved away the facts were precisely as i stated i was leaning out of the library window and chancing to lean too far i lost my balance and fell that i might have received serious injuries and was entitled to expect sympathy i overlook but the words mad as a coot i resent extremely had this incident not occurred i would not have dreamed of saying anything to prejudice you against your host as it is i feel that in justice to myself i must tell you that lord emsworth is a man to whose utterances no attention should be paid he is to all intents and purposes half witted life in the country with its lack of intellectual stimulus has caused his natural feebleness of mind to reach a stage which borders closely on insanity his relatives look on him as virtually an imbecile and have in my opinion every cause to do so in these circumstances i think i may rely on you to attach no importance to his remarks this afternoon yours sincerely r j baxter p s you will of course treat this as entirely confidential p p s if you are fond of chess and would care for a game after dinner i am a good player p p s s or bezique sue thought it a good letter neat and well expressed why it had been written she could not imagine it had not occurred to her that love or at any rate a human desire to marry a wealthy heiress had begun to burgeon in r j baxter s bosom with no particular emotions other than the feeling that if he was counting on playing bezique with her after dinner he was due for a disappointment she put the letter in her pocket and looked out over the park again the object of all good literature is to purge the soul of its petty troubles this she was pleased to discover baxter s letter had succeeded in doing recalling its polished phrases she found herself smiling appreciatively that muttering sky did not look so menacing now everything she told herself was going to be all right after all she did not ask much from fate just an uninterrupted five minutes with ronnie and if fate so far had denied her this very moderate demand all alone sue turned her heart beating quickly the voice speaking close behind her had had something of the effect of a douche of iced water down her back for restorative though baxter s letter had been it had not left her in quite the frame of mind to enjoy anything so sudden and jumpy as an unexpected voice it was the hon galahad back from his interview with the gentleman and the sight of him did nothing to calm her agitation he was eying her she thought with a strange and sinister intentness and though his manner as he planted himself beside her and began to talk seemed all that was cordial and friendly she could not rid herself of a feeling of uneasiness that look still lingered in her mind s eye with the air all heavy and woolly and the sky growling pessimistic prophecies it had been a look to alarm the bravest girl chattering amiably the hon galahad spoke of this and that of scenery and the weather of birds and rabbits of friends of his who had served terms in prison and of other friends who one would have said on the evidence had been lucky to escape then his monocle was up again and that look was back on his face the air was more breathless than ever you know said the hon galahad it s been a great treat to me meeting you my dear i haven t seen any of your people for a number of years but your father and i correspond pretty regularly he tells me all the news did you leave your family well quite well how was your aunt edna fine said sue feebly ah said the hon galahad then your father must have been mistaken when he told me she was dead but perhaps you thought i meant your aunt edith yes said sue gratefully she s all right i hope oh yes what a lovely woman yes you mean she still is oh yes remarkable she must be well over seventy by now no doubt you mean beautiful considering she is over seventy yes pretty active oh yes when did you see her last oh just before i sailed and you say she s active curious i heard two years ago that she was paralyzed i suppose you mean active for a paralytic the little puckers at the corners of his eyes deepened into wrinkles the monocle gleamed like the eye of a dragon he smiled genially confide in me miss brown he said what s the game chapter xi i sue did not answer when the solid world melts abruptly beneath the feet one feels disinclined for speech avoiding the monocle she stood looking with wide blank eyes at a thrush which hopped fussily about the lawn behind her the sky gave a low chuckle as if this was what it had been waiting for up there proceeded the hon galahad pointing to the small library is the room where i work and sometimes when i m not working i look out of the window i was looking out a short while back when you were down here talking to my brother clarence there was a fellow with me he looked out too his voice sounded blurred and far away a theatrical manager fellow i used to know very well in the old days a man named mason the thrush had flown away sue continued to gaze at the spot where it had been across the years for the mind works oddly in times of stress there had come to her vivid recollection of herself at the age of ten taken by her mother to the isle of man on her first steamer trip and just beginning to feel the motion of the vessel there had been a moment then just before the supreme catastrophe when she had felt exactly as she was feeling now we saw you and he said why there s sue i said sue sue who sue brown said this fellow mason he said you were one of the girls at his theatre he didn t seem particularly surprised to see you here he said he took it that everything had been fixed up all right and he was glad because you were one of the best he wanted to come and have a chat with you but i headed him off i thought you might prefer to talk over this little matter of your being miss sue brown alone with me which brings me back to my original question what miss brown is the game sue felt dizzy helpless hopeless i can t explain she said the hon galahad tut tutted protestingly you don t mean to say you propose to leave the thing as just another of those historic mysteries don t you want me ever to get a good night s sleep again oh it s so long we have the evening before us take it bit by bit a little at a time to begin with what did mason mean by saying that everything was all right i had told him about ronnie ronnie my nephew ronald yes and seeing me here he naturally took it for granted that lord emsworth and the rest of you had consented to the engagement and invited me to the castle engagement i used to be engaged to ronnie what that young fish yes good god said the hon galahad suddenly sue began to feel conscious of a slackening of the tension mysteriously the conversation was seeming less difficult in spite of the fact that reason scoffed at the absurdity of such an idea she felt just as if she were talking to a potential friend and ally the thought had come to her at the moment when looking up she caught sight of her companion s face it is an unpleasant thing to say of any man but there is no denying that the hon galahad s face when he was listening to the confessions of those who had behaved as they ought not to have behaved very frequently lacked the austerity and disapproval which one likes to see in faces on such occasions but however did pa mason come to be here asked sue he came to discuss some business in connection with never mind about that said the hon galahad calling the meeting to order kindly refrain from wandering from the point i m beginning to see daylight you are engaged to ronald you say i was but you broke it off he broke it off he did yes that s why i came here you see ronnie was here and i was in london and you can t put things properly in letters so i thought that if i could get down to blandings i could see him and explain and put everything right and i d met lady constance in london one day when i was with ronnie and he had introduced me as miss schoonmaker so that part of it was all right so well so i came if this chronicle has proved anything it has proved by now that the moral outlook of the hon galahad threepwood was fundamentally unsound a man to shake the head at a man to view with concern so felt his sister lady constance keeble and she was undoubtedly right if final evidence were needed his next words supplied it i never heard said the hon galahad beaming like one listening to a tale of virtue triumphant anything so dashed sporting in my life sue s heart leaped she had felt all along that reason in denying the possibility that this man could ever approve of what she had done had been mistaken these pessimists always are you mean she cried you won t give me away me said the hon galahad aghast at the idea of course i won t what do you take me for i think you re an angel the hon galahad seemed pleased at the compliment but it was plain that there was something that worried him he frowned a little what i can t make out he said is why you want to marry my nephew ronald i love him bless his heart no seriously protested the hon galahad do you know that he once put tin tacks on my chair and he throws tennis balls at pigs all the same i love him you can t i do how can you possibly love a fellow like that that s just what he always used to say said sue softly and i think that s why i love him the hon galahad sighed fifty years experience had taught him that it was no use arguing with women on this particular point but he had conceived a warm affection for this girl and it shocked him to think of her madly throwing herself away don t you go doing anything in a hurry my dear think it over carefully i ve seen enough of you to know that you re a very exceptional girl i don t believe you like ronnie i don t dislike him he s improved since he was a boy i ll admit that but he isn t worthy of you why not well he isn t she laughed it s funny that you of all people should say that lord emsworth was telling me just now that ronnie is exactly like what you used to be at his age what that s what he said the hon galahad stared incredulously that boy like me he spoke with indignation for his pride had been sorely touched ronald like me why i was twice the man he is how many policemen do you think it used to take to shift me from the alhambra to vine street when i was in my prime two sometimes three and one walking behind carrying my hat clarence ought to be more careful what he says dash it it s just this kind of loose talk that makes trouble the fact of the matter is he s gone and got his brain so addled with pigs he doesn t know what he is saying half the time he pulled himself together with a strong effort he became calmer what did you and that young poop quarrel about he asked he is not a poop he is it s astonishing to me that any one individual can be such a poop you d have thought it would have required a large syndicate how long have you known him about nine months well i ve known him all his life and i say he s a poop if he wasn t he wouldn t have quarrelled with you however we won t split straws what did you quarrel about he found me dancing what s wrong with that i had promised him i wouldn t and is that all the trouble it s quite enough for me the hon galahad made light of the tragedy i don t see what you re worrying about if you can t smooth a little thing like that over you re not the girl i take you for i thought i might be able to of course you ll be able to girls were always doing that sort of thing to me in my young days and i never held out for five minutes once the crying started go and sob on the boy s waistcoat how are you as a sobber not very good i m afraid well there are all sorts of other tricks you can try every girl knows a dozen falling on your knees fainting laughing hysterically going rigid all over scores of them i think it will be all right if i can just talk to him the difficulty is to get an opportunity the hon galahad waved a hand spaciously make an opportunity why i knew a girl years ago she s a grandmother now who had a quarrel with the fellow she was engaged to and a week or so later she found herself staying at the same country house with him heron s hill it was the matchelows place in sussex and she got him into her room one night and locked the door and said she was going to keep him there all night and ruin both their reputations unless he handed back the ring and agreed that the engagement was on again and she d have done it too her name was frederica something red haired girl i suppose you have to have red hair to do a thing like that i was thinking of a quiet meeting in the rose garden the hon galahad seemed to consider this tame but he let it pass well whatever you do you ll have to be quick about it my dear suppose old johnny schoonmaker s girl really turns up she said she was going to yes but i made ronnie send her a telegram signed with lady constance s name saying that there was scarlet fever at the castle and she wasn t to come one dislikes the necessity of perpetually piling up the evidence against the hon galahad threepwood to show ever more and more clearly how warped was his moral outlook nevertheless the fact must be stated that at these words he threw his head up and uttered a high piercing laugh that sent the thrush which had just returned to the lawn starting back as if a bullet had hit it it was a laugh which when it had rung out in days of yore in london s more lively night resorts had caused commissionaires to leap like war horses at the note of the bugle to spit on their hands feel their muscles and prepare for action it s the finest thing i ever heard cried the hon galahad it restores my faith in the younger generation and a girl like you seriously contemplates marrying a boy like oh well he said resignedly seeming to brace himself to make the best of a distasteful state of affairs it s your business i suppose you know your own mind best after all the great thing is to get you into the family a girl like you is what this family has been needing for years he patted her kindly on the shoulder and they started to walk toward the house as they did so two men came out of it one was lord emsworth the other was percy pilbeam ii there is about a place like blandings castle something which if you are not in the habit of visiting country houses planned on the grand scale tends to sap the morale at the moment when sue caught sight of him the proprietor of the argus enquiry agency was not feeling his brightest and best beach ushering him through the front door had started the trouble he had merely let his eye rest upon pilbeam but it had been enough the butler s eye through years of insufficient exercise and too hearty feeding had acquired in the process of time a sort of glaze which many people found trying when they saw it in pilbeam it created an inferiority complex of the severest kind he could not know that to this godlike man he was merely a blur to beach tortured by the pangs of a guilty conscience almost everything nowadays was merely a blur misinterpreting his gaze pilbeam had read into it a shocked contempt a kind of wincing agony at the thought that things like himself should be creeping into blandings castle he felt as if he had crawled out from under a flat stone and it was at this moment that somebody in the dimness of the hall had stepped forward and revealed himself as the young man name unknown who had showed such a lively disposition to murder him on the dancing floor of mario s restaurant and from the violent start which he gave it was plain that the young man s memory was as good as his own so far things had not broken well for percy pilbeam but now his luck turned there had appeared in the nick of time an angel from heaven effectively disguised in a shabby shooting coat and an old hat he had introduced himself as lord emsworth and he had taken pilbeam off with him into the garden looking back over his shoulder pilbeam saw that the young man was still standing there staring after him wistfully it seemed to him and he was glad as he followed his host out into the fresh air to be beyond the range of his eye between it and the eye of beach the butler there seemed little to choose relief however by the time he arrived on the terrace had not completely restored his composure that inferiority complex was still at work and his surroundings intimidated him at any moment he felt on a terrace like this there might suddenly appear to confront him and complete his humiliation some brilliant shattering creature indigenous to this strange and disturbing world a duchess perhaps a haughty hunting woman it might be the dashing daughter of a hundred earls possibly who would look at him as beach had looked at him and raising beautifully pencilled eyebrows in aristocratic disdain turn away with a murmured most extraordinary he was prepared for almost anything one of the few things he was not prepared for was sue and at the sight of her he leaped three clear inches and nearly broke a collar stud gaw he said i beg your pardon said lord emsworth he had not caught his companion s remark and hoped he would repeat it the lightest utterance of a detective with the trained mind is something not to be missed what did you say my dear fellow he too perceived sue and with a prodigious effort of the memory working by swift stages through schofield maybury coolidge and spooner recalled her name mr pilbeam miss schoonmaker he said galahad this is mr pilbeam of the argus you remember pilbeam how do you do pilbeam my brother said lord emsworth exerting himself to complete the introduction this is my brother galahad pilbeam said the hon galahad looking intently at the proprietor of the argus were you ever connected with a paper called society spice mr pilbeam the gardens of blandings castle seemed to the detective to rock gently there had he knew been a rigid rule in the office of that bright but frequently offensive paper that the editor s name was never to be revealed to callers but it now appeared only too sickeningly evident that a leakage had occurred underlings he realized too late can be bribed he swallowed painfully force of habit had come within a hair s breadth of making him say quite never he gasped certainly not no never a fellow of your name used to edit it uncommon name too relation perhaps distant well i m sorry you re not the man said the hon galahad regretfully i ve been wanting to meet him he wrote a very offensive thing about me once most offensive thing lord emsworth who had been according the conversation the rather meagre interest which he gave to all conversations that did not deal with pigs created a diversion i wonder he said if you would like to see some photographs it seemed to pilbeam in his disordered state strange that anyone should suppose that he was in a frame of mind to enjoy the family album but he uttered a strangled sound which his host took for acquiescence of the empress i mean of course they will give you some idea of what a magnificent animal she is they will he sought for the mot juste stimulate you i ll go to the library and get them out the hon galahad was now his old affable self again you doing anything after dinner he asked sue there was some talk said sue of a game of bezique with mr baxter don t dream of it said the hon galahad vehemently the fellow would probably try to brain you with the mallet i was thinking that if i hadn t got to go out to dinner i d like to read you some of my book i think you would appreciate it i wouldn t read it to anybody except you i somehow feel you ve got the right sort of outlook i let my sister constance see a couple of pages once and she was too depressing for words an author can t work if people depress him i ll tell you what i ll do i ll give you the thing to read which is your room the garden room i think it s called oh yes well i ll bring the manuscript to you before i leave he sauntered off there was a moment s pause then sue turned to pilbeam her chin was tilted there was defiance in her eye well she said iii percy pilbeam breathed a sigh of relief at the first moment of their meeting all that he had ever read about doubles had raced through his mind this question clarified the situation it put matters on a firm basis his head ceased to swim it was sue brown and no other who stood before him what on earth are you doing here he asked never mind what s the game never mind there s no need to be so dashed unfriendly well if you must know i came here to see ronnie and try to explain about that night at mario s there was a pause what was that name the old boy called you schoonmaker why did he call you that because that s who he thinks i am what on earth made you choose a name like that oh don t keep asking questions i don t believe there is such a name and when it comes to asking questions said pilbeam warmly what do you expect me to do i never got such a shock in my life as when i met you just now i thought i was seeing things do you mean to say you re here under a false name pretending to be somebody else yes well i m hanged and as friendly as you please with everybody yes everybody except me why should i be friendly with you you ve done your best to ruin my life eh oh never mind said sue impatiently there was another pause chatty said pilbeam wounded again he fidgeted his fingers along the wall the galahad fellow seems to look on you as a daughter or something we are great friends so i see and he s going to give you his book to read yes a keen purposeful argus enquiry agency sort of look shot into pilbeam s face well this is where you and i get together he said what do you mean i ll tell you what i mean do you want to make some money no said sue what of course you do everybody does now listen do you know why i m here i ve stopped wondering why you re anywhere you just seem to pop up she started to move away a sudden disturbing thought had come to her at any moment ronnie might appear on the terrace if he found her here closeted so to speak with the abominable pilbeam what would he think what rather would he not think where are you going into the house come back said pilbeam urgently i m going but i ve got something important to say well she stopped that s right said pilbeam approvingly now listen you ll admit that if i liked i could give you away and spoil whatever game it is that you re up to in this place well but i m not going to do it if you ll be sensible sensible pilbeam looked cautiously up and down the terrace now listen he said i want your help i ll tell you why i m here the old boy thinks i ve come down to find his pig but i haven t i ve come to get that book your friend galahad is writing what i thought you d be surprised yes that s what i m after there s a man living near here who s scared stiff that there s going to be a lot of stories about him in that book and he came to see me at my office yesterday and offered me he hesitated a moment offered me he went on a hundred pounds if i d get into the house somehow and snitch the manuscript and you being friendly with the old buster has made everything simple you think so easy he assured her especially now he s going to give you the thing to read all you have to do is hand it over to me and there s fifty quid for you for doing practically nothing sue s eyes lit up pilbeam had expected that they would he could not conceive of a girl whose eyes would not light up at such an offer oh said sue fifty quid said pilbeam i m going halves with you and if i don t do what you want i suppose you will tell them who i really am that s it said pilbeam pleased at her ready intelligence well i m not going to do anything of the kind what and if said sue you want to tell these people who i am go ahead and tell them i will do but just bear in mind that the moment you do i shall tell mr threepwood that it was you who wrote that thing about him in society spice percy pilbeam swayed like a sapling in the breeze the blow had unmanned him he found no words with which to reply i will said sue pilbeam continued speechless he was still trying to recover from this deadly thrust through an unexpected chink in his armour when the opportunity for speech passed millicent had appeared and was walking along the terrace toward them she wore her customary air of settled gloom on reaching them she paused hullo said millicent from the depths hullo said sue the library window framed the head and shoulders of lord emsworth pilbeam my dear fellow will you come up to the library i have found the photographs millicent eyed the detective s retreating back with a mournful curiosity who s he a man named pilbeam pill i should say is right what makes him waddle like that sue was unable to supply a solution to this problem millicent came and stood beside her and leaning on the stone parapet gazed disparagingly at the park she gave the impression of disliking all parks but this one particularly ever read schopenhauer she asked after a silence no you should great stuff she fell into a heavy silence again her eyes peering into the gathering gloom somewhere in the twilight world a cow had begun to emit long nerve racking bellows the sound seemed to sum up and underline the general sadness schopenhauer says that all the suffering in the world can t be mere chance must be meant he says life s a mixture of suffering and boredom you ve got to have one or the other his stuff s full of snappy cracks like that you d enjoy it well i m going for a walk you coming i don t think i will thanks just as you like schopenhauer says suicide s absolutely o k he says hindoos do it instead of going to church they bung themselves into the ganges and get eaten by crocodiles and call it a well spent day what a lot you seem to know about schopenhauer i ve been reading him up lately found a copy in the library schopenhauer says we are like lambs in a field disporting themselves under the eye of the butcher who chooses first one and then another for his prey sure you won t come for a walk no thanks really i think i ll go in just as you like said millicent liberty hall she moved off a few steps then returned sorry if i seem loopy she said something on my mind been giving it a spot of thought the fact is i ve just got engaged to be married to my cousin ronnie the trees that stood out against the banking clouds seemed to swim before sue s eyes an unseen hand had clutched her by the throat and was crushing the life out of her ronnie yes said millicent rather in the tone of voice which schopenhauer would have used when announcing the discovery of a caterpillar in his salad we fixed it up just now she wandered away and sue clung to the terrace wall that at least was solid in a world that rocked and crashed i say it was hugo she was looking at him through a mist but there was never any mistaking hugo carmody i say did she tell you sue nodded she s engaged sue nodded she s going to marry ronnie death where is thy sting said hugo and vanished in the direction taken by millicent chapter xii i the firm and dignified note in which rupert baxter had expressed his considered opinion of the earl of emsworth had been written in the morning room immediately upon the ex secretary s return to the house and delivered into beach s charge with hands still stained with garden mould only when this urgent task had been performed did he start to go upstairs in quest of the wash and brush up which he so greatly needed he was mounting the stairs to his bedroom and had reached the first floor when a door opened and his progress was arrested by what in a lesser woman would have been a yelp proceeding as it did from the lips of lady constance keeble we must call it an exclamation of surprise mr baxter she was standing in the doorway of her boudoir and she eyed his dishevelled form with such open mouthed astonishment that for an instant the ex secretary came near to including her with the head of the family in the impromptu commination service which was taking shape in his mind he was in no mood for wide eyed looks of wonder may i come in he said curtly he could explain all but did not wish to do so on the first floor landing of a house where almost anybody might be listening with flapping ears but mr baxter said lady constance he paused for a moment to grit his teeth then closed the door what have you been doing mr baxter jumping out of window jumping out of win dow he gave a brief synopsis of the events which had led up to his spirited act lady constance drew in her breath with a remorseful hiss oh dear she said how foolish of me i should have told you i beg your pardon even though she was in the safe retirement of her boudoir lady constance keeble looked cautiously over her shoulder in the stirring and complicated state into which life had got itself at blandings castle practically everybody in the place except lord emsworth had fallen into the habit nowadays of looking cautiously over his or her shoulder before he or she spoke sir gregory parsloe said in his note she explained that this man pilbeam who is coming here this evening is acting for him acting for him yes apparently sir gregory went to see him yesterday and has promised him a large sum of money if he will obtain possession of my brother galahad s manuscript that is why he has invited us to dinner to night to get galahad out of the house so there was no need for you to have troubled there was silence so there was no need repeated the efficient baxter slowly wiping from his eye the remains of a fragment of mould which had been causing him some inconvenience for me to have troubled i am so sorry mr baxter pray do not mention it lady constance his eye now that the mould was out of it was able to work again with its customary keenness his spectacles as he surveyed the remorseful woman before him had a cold steely look i see he said well it might perhaps have spared me some little inconvenience had you informed me of this earlier lady constance i have bruised my left shin somewhat severely and as you see made myself rather dirty i am so sorry furthermore i gathered from the remark he let fall that the impression my actions have made upon lord emsworth is that i am insane oh dear he even specified the precise degree of insanity as mad as a coot were his words he softened a little he reminded himself that this woman before him who was so nearly doing what is described as wringing the hands had always been his friend had always wished him well had never slackened her efforts to restore him to the secretarial duties which he had once enjoyed well it can not be helped he said the thing now is to think of some way of recovering the lost ground you mean if you could find the empress exactly oh mr baxter if you only could i can lady constance stared at his dark purposeful efficient face in dumb admiration to another man who had spoken those words she would have replied how or even how on earth but as they had proceeded from rupert baxter she merely waited silently for enlightenment have you given this matter any consideration lady constance yes to what conclusions have you come lady constance felt dull and foolish she felt like doctor watson almost like a scotland yard bungler i don t think i have come to any she said avoiding the spectacles guiltily of course she added i think it is absurd to suppose that sir gregory baxter waved aside the notion it was not even worth a tchah in any matter of this kind he said the first thing to do is to seek motive who is there in blandings castle who could have had a motive for stealing lord emsworth s pig lady constance would have given a year s income to have been able to make some reasonably intelligent reply but all she could do was look and listen baxter was not annoyed he would not have had it otherwise he preferred his audiences dumb and expectant carmody mr carmody precisely he is lord emsworth s secretary and a most inefficient secretary a secretary who stands hourly in danger of losing his position he sees me arrive at the castle a man who formerly held the post he holds he is alarmed he suspects he searches wildly about in his mind for means of consolidating himself in lord emsworth s regard then he has an idea the sort of wild motion picture bred idea which would come to a man of his stamp he thinks to himself that if he removes the pig and conceals it somewhere and then pretends to have found it and restores it to its owner lord emsworth s gratitude will be so intense that all danger of his dismissal will be at an end he removed his spectacles and wiped them lady constance uttered a low cry in anybody else it would have been a squeak baxter replaced his spectacles i have no doubt the pig is somewhere in the grounds at this moment he said but mr baxter the ex secretary raised a compelling hand but he would not have undertaken a thing like this single handed a secretary s time is not his own and it would be necessary to feed the pig at regular intervals he would require an accomplice and i think i know who that accomplice is beach this time not even the chronicler s desire to place lady constance s utterances in the best and most attractive light can hide the truth she bleated bee ee ee ee ech the spectacles raked her keenly have you observed beach closely of late she shook her head she was not a woman who observed butlers closely he has something on his mind he is nervous guilty conscience stricken he jumps when you speak to him does he jumps repeated the efficient baxter just now i gave him a i happened to address him and he sprang in the air he paused i have half a mind to go and question him oh mr baxter would that be wise rupert baxter s intention of interrogating the butler had been merely a nebulous one a sort of idle dream but these words crystallized it into a resolve he was not going to have people asking him if things would be wise a few searching questions should force him to reveal the truth but he ll give notice this interview had been dotted with occasions on which baxter might reasonably have said tchah but as we have seen until this moment he had refrained he now said it tchah said the efficient baxter there are plenty of other butlers and with this undeniable truth he stalked from the room the wash and brush up were still as necessary as they had been ten minutes before but he was too intent on the chase to think about washes and brushes up he hurried down the stairs he crossed the hall he passed through the green baize door that led to the quarters of the blandings castle staff and he was making his way along the dim passage to the pantry where at this hour beach might be supposed to be when its door opened abruptly and a vast form emerged it was the butler and from the fact that he was wearing a bowler hat it was plain that he was seeking the great outdoors baxter stopped in mid stride and remained on one leg watching then as his quarry disappeared in the direction of the back entrance he followed quickly out in the open it was almost as dark as it had been in the passage that gray threatening sky had turned black by now it was a swollen mass of inky clouds heavy with the thunder lightning and rain which so often come in the course of an english summer to remind the island race that they are hardy nordics and must not be allowed to get their fibre all sapped by eternal sunshine like the less favoured dwellers in more southerly climes it bayed at baxter like a bloodhound but it took more than dirty weather to quell the efficient baxter when duty called like the character in tennyson s poem who followed the gleam he followed the butler there was but one point about beach which even remotely resembled a gleam but it happened to be only one which at this moment really mattered he was easy to follow the shrubbery swallowed the butler a few seconds later it had swallowed the efficient baxter ii there are those who maintain and make a nice income by doing so in the evening papers that in these degenerate days the old hardy spirit of the briton has died out they represent themselves as seeking vainly for evidence of the survival of those qualities of toughness and endurance which once made englishmen what they were to such the spectacle of rupert baxter braving the elements could not have failed to bring cheer and consolation they would have been further stimulated by the conduct of hugo carmody it had not escaped hugo s notice as he left sue on the terrace and started out in the wake of millicent that the weather was hotting up for a storm he saw the clouds he heard the fast approaching thunder for neither did he give a hoot let it rain was hugo s verdict let it jolly well rain as much as it dashed well wanted to as if encouraged the sky sent down a fat wet drop which insinuated itself just between his neck and collar he hardly noticed it the information confided to him by his friend ronald fish had numbed his senses so thoroughly that water down the back of the neck was merely an incident he was feeling as he had not felt since the evening some years ago when boxing for his university in the light weight division he had incautiously placed the point of his jaw in the exact spot at the moment occupied by his opponent s right fist when you have done this or equally when you have just been told that the girl you love is definitely betrothed to another you begin to understand how anarchists must feel when the bomb goes off too soon in all the black days through which he had been living recently hugo had never really lost hope it had been dim sometimes but it had always been there it was his opinion that he knew women just as it was sue s idea that she knew men like sue he had placed his trust in the thought that true love conquers all obstacles that coldness melts that sundered hearts may at long last be brought together again by a little judicious pleading and reasoning even the fact that millicent stared at him when they met with large scornful eyes that went through him like stilettos unpleasant though it was had not caused him to despair he had looked forward to the moment when he should contrive to get her alone and do a bit of snappy talking along the right lines but this was final this was the end this put the tin hat on it she was engaged to ronnie soon she would be married to ronnie like a gadfly the hideous thought sent hugo carmody reeling on through the gloom it was so dark now that he could scarcely see before him and looking about him he discovered that the reason for this was that he had made his way into a wood of sorts the west wood he deduced dully taking into consideration the fact that there was no other in this particular part of the estate well he might just as well be in the west wood as anywhere he trudged on the ground beneath his feet was spongy and equipped with low lying brambles which pricked through his thin flannels and would have caused him discomfort if he had been in the frame of mind to notice brambles there were trees against which he bumped and logs over which he tripped and ahead of him in a small clearing there was a dilapidated looking cottage he noticed this because it seemed the sort of place where a man now that a warm gusty wind had sprung up might shelter and light a cigarette the need for tobacco had become imperative he was surprised to find that it was raining and had apparently from the state of his clothes been raining for quite some time it was also thundering the storm had broken and the boom of it seemed to be all round him a flash of lightning reminded him that he was in just the kind of place among all these trees where blokes get struck at dinner time they are missed and later on search parties come out with lanterns somebody stumbles over something soft and the rays of the lantern fall on a charred and blackened form here quickly we have found him where over here is that hugo carmody well well pick him up boys and bring him along he was a good chap once moody though of late some trouble about a girl wasn t it she will be sorry when she hears of this drove him to it you might almost say steady with that stretcher now when i say to me right there was something about this picture which quite cheered hugo up ajax defied the lightning hugo carmody rather encouraged it than otherwise he looked approvingly at a more than usually vivid flash that seemed to dart among the treetops like a snake all the same he was forced to reflect he was getting dashed wet no sense when you came right down to it in getting dashed wet after all a man could be struck by lightning just as well in that cottage sort of place over there ho for the cottage felt hugo and headed for it at a gallop he had just reached the door when it was flung open there was a noise rather like that made by a rising pheasant and the next moment something white had flung itself into his arms and was weeping emotionally on his chest hugo hugo darling reason told hugo it could scarcely be millicent who was clinging to him like this and speaking to him like this and yet millicent it most certainly appeared to be she continued to speak still in the same friendly even chatty strain hugo save me right ho i wur wur went in thur thur there to shush shush shelter from the rain and it s all pitch dark hugo squeezed her fondly and with the sort of relief that comes to men who find themselves squeezing where they had not thought to squeeze no need for that snappy bit of talking now no need for arguments and explanations for pleadings and entreaties no need for anything but a good biceps he was bewildered but mixed with his bewilderment had come a certain feeling of complacency there was no denying that it was enjoyable this exhibition of tremulous weakness in one who if she had had the shadow of a fault had always been inclined to matter of factness and the display of that rather hard bright self sufficiency which is so characteristic of the modern girl if this melting mood was due to the fact that millicent while in the cottage had seen a ghost hugo wanted to meet that ghost and shake its hand every man likes to be in a position to say there there little woman to the girl of his heart particularly if for the last few days she has been treating him like a more than ordinarily unpleasant worm and hugo carmody felt that he was in that position now there there he said not quite feeling up to risking the little woman it s all right but it tut tut tut it what said hugo puzzled it tut tut tut tisn t there s a man in there a man yes i didn t know there was anyone there and it was pitch dark and i heard something move and i said who s that and then he suddenly spoke to me in german in german yes hugo released her gently his face was determined i m going in to have a look hugo stop you ll be killed she stood there rigid the rain lashed about her but she did not heed it the lightning gleamed she paid it no attention for the minute that lasts an hour she waited straining her ears for sounds of the death struggle then a dim form appeared i say millicent hugo are you all right yes i m all right i say millicent do you know what no what a chuckle came to her through the darkness it s the pig it s what the pig who s a pig this is your friend in here it s empress of blandings as large as life come and have a look iii millicent had a look she came to the door of the cottage and peered in yes just as he had said there was the empress in the feeble light of the match that hugo was holding the noble animal s attractive face was peering up at her questioningly as if wondering if she might be the bearer of the evening snack which would be so exceedingly welcome the picture was one which would have set lord emsworth screaming with joy millicent merely gaped how on earth did she get here that s what i m going to find out said hugo one always knew she must be cached somewhere of course what is this place anyway it used to be a gamekeeper s cottage i believe well there seems to be a room up above said hugo striking another match i m going to go up there and wait it s quite likely that somebody will be along soon to feed the animal and i m going to see who it is yes that s what we ll do how clever of you not you you get back home i won t there was a pause a strong man would no doubt have asserted himself but hugo though feeling better than he had done for days was not feeling quite so strong as all that just as you like he shut the door well come on we d better be making a move the fellow may be here at any moment they climbed the crazy stairs and lowered themselves cautiously to a floor which smelled of mice and mildew below all was in darkness but there were holes through which it would be possible to look when the time should come for looking millicent could feel one near her face you don t think this floor will give way she asked rather nervously i shouldn t think so why well i don t want to break my neck you don t don t you well i would jolly well like to break mine said hugo speaking tensely in the darkness it had just occurred to him that now would be a good time for a heart to heart talk if you suppose i m keen on going on living with you and ronnie doing the wedding glide all over the place you re dashed well mistaken i take it you re aware that you ve broken my bally heart what oh hugo said millicent silence fell below the empress rustled aloft something scuttered oo cried millicent was that a rat i hope so what rats gnaw you explained hugo they cluster round and chew you to the bone and put an end to your misery there was silence again then millicent spoke in a small voice you re being beastly she said remorse poured over hugo in a flood i m frightfully sorry yes i know i am dash it but look here you know i mean all this getting engaged to ronnie a bit thick what you don t expect me to give three hearty cheers do you wouldn t want me to break into a few care free dance steps i can t believe it s really happened well how did it happen it sort of happened all of a sudden i was feeling miserable and very angry with you and and all that and i met ronnie and he took me for a stroll and we went down by the lake and started throwing little bits of stick at the swans and suddenly ronnie sort of grunted and said i say and i said hullo and he said will you marry me and i said all right and he said i ought to warn you i despise all women and i said and i loathe all men and he said right o i think we shall be very happy i see i only did it to score off you you succeeded a trace of spirit crept into millicent s voice you never really loved me she said you know jolly well you didn t is that so well what did you want to go sneaking off to london for then and stuffing that beastly girl of yours with food she isn t my girl and she isn t beastly she is well you seem to get on with her all right i saw you chatting on the terrace together as cosily as dammit what miss schoonmaker i don t know what you re talking about what s miss schoonmaker got to do with it miss schoonmaker isn t miss schoonmaker she s sue brown for a moment it seemed to millicent that the crack in her companion s heart had spread to his head futile though the action was she stared in the direction from which his voice had proceeded then suddenly his words took on a meaning she gasped she s followed you down here she hasn t followed me down here she s followed ronnie down here can t you get it into your nut said hugo with justifiable exasperation that you ve been making floaters and bloomers and getting everything mixed up all along sue brown has never cared a curse for me and i ve never thought anything about her except that she s a jolly girl and nice to dance with that s absolutely and positively the only reason i went out with her i hadn t had a dance for six weeks and my feet had begun to itch so that i couldn t sleep at night so i went to london and took her out and ronnie found her talking to that pestilence pilbeam and thought he had taken her out and she had told him she didn t even know the man which was quite true but ronnie cut up rough and said he was through with her and came down here and she wanted to get a word with him so she came down here pretending to be miss schoonmaker and the moment she gets here she finds ronnie is engaged to you a nice surprise for the poor girl millicent s head had begun to swim long before the conclusion of this recital but what is pilbeam doing down here pilbeam he was on the terrace talking to her a low snarl came through the darkness pilbeam here ah so he came after all did he he s the fellow lord emsworth sent me to about the empress he runs the argus enquiry agency it was pilbeam s minions that dogged my steps that night at your request so he s here is he well let him enjoy himself while he can let him sniff the country air while the sniffing is good a bitter reckoning awaits that bloke from the disorder of millicent s mind another point emerged insistently demanding explanation you said she wasn t pretty who sue brown nor is she you don t call her pretty she s fascinating not to me said hugo doggedly there s only one girl in the world that i call pretty and she s going to marry ronnie he paused if you haven t realized by this time that i love you and always shall love you and have never loved anybody else and never shall love anybody else you re a fathead if you brought me sue brown or any other girl in the world on a plate with watercress round her i wouldn t so much as touch her hand another rat unless it was an exceptionally large mouse had begun to make its presence felt in the darkness it seemed to be enjoying an early dinner off a piece of wood millicent did not even notice it she had reached out and her hand had touched hugo s arm her fingers closed on it desperately oh hugo she said the arm became animated it clutched her drew her along the mouse and mildew scented floor and time stood still hugo was the first to break the silence and to think that not so long ago i was wishing that a flash of lightning would strike me amidships he said the aroma of mouse and mildew had passed away violets seemed to be spreading their fragrance through the cottage violets and roses the rat a noisy feeder had changed into an orchestra of harps dulcimers and sackbuts that played soft music and then jarring upon these sweet strains there came the sound of the cottage door opening and a moment later light shone through the holes in the floor millicent gave hugo s arm a warning pinch they looked down on the floor below stood a lantern and beside it a man of massive build who from the golloping noises that floated upward appeared to be giving the empress those calories and proteids which a pig of her dimensions requires so often and in such large quantities this good samaritan had been stooping now he straightened himself and looked about him with an apprehensive eye he raised the lantern and its light fell upon his face and as she saw that face millicent forgetting prudence uttered in a high startled voice a single word beach cried millicent down below the butler stood congealed it seemed to him that the voice of conscience had spoken iv conscience besides having a musical voice appeared also to be equipped with feet beach could hear them clattering down the stairs and the volume of noise was so great that it seemed as if conscience must be a centipede but he did not stir it would have required at that moment a derrick to move him and there was no derrick in the gamekeeper s cottage in the west wood he was still standing like a statue when hugo and millicent arrived only when the identity of the newcomers impressed itself on his numbed senses did his limbs begin to twitch and show some signs of relaxing for he looked on hugo as a friend hugo he felt was one of the few people in his world who finding him in his present questionable position might be expected to take the broad and sympathetic view he nerved himself to speak good evening sir good evening miss what s all this said hugo years ago in his hot and reckless youth beach had once heard that question from the lips of a policeman it had disconcerted him then it disconcerted him now well sir he replied millicent was staring at the empress who after one courteous look of inquiry at the intruders had given a brief grunt of welcome and returned to the agenda you stole her beach you the butler quivered he had known this girl since her long hair and rompers days she had sported in his pantry he had cut elephants out of paper for her and taught her tricks with bits of string the shocked note in her voice seared him like vitriol to her he felt niece to the earl of emsworth and trained by his lordship from infancy in the best traditions of pig worship the theft of the empress must seem the vilest of crimes he burned to re stablish himself in her eyes there comes in the life of every conspirator a moment when loyalty to his accomplices wavers before the urge to make things right for himself we can advance no more impressive proof of the nobility of the butler s soul than that he did not obey this impulse millicent s accusing eyes were piercing him but he remained true to his trust mr ronald had sworn him to secrecy and even to square himself he could not betray him and as if by way of a direct reward from providence for this sterling conduct inspiration descended upon beach yes miss he replied oh beach yes miss it was i who stole the animal i did it for your sake miss hugo eyed him sternly beach he said this is pure apple sauce sir apple sauce i repeat why endeavour to swing the lead beach what do you mean you stole the pig for her sake yes said millicent why for my sake the butler was calm now he had constructed his story and he was going to stick to it in order to remove the obstacles in your path miss obstacles owing to the fact that you and mr carmody have frequently entrusted me with your may i say surreptitious correspondence i have long been cognizant of your sentiments toward one another miss i am aware that it is your desire to contract a union with mr carmody and i knew that there would be objections raised on the part of certain members of the family so far said hugo critically this sounds to me like drivel of the purest water but go on thank you sir and then it occurred to me that were his lordship s pig to disappear his lordship would on recovering the animal be extremely grateful to whoever restores it it was my intention to apprise you of the animal s whereabouts and suggest that you should inform his lordship that you had discovered it in his gratitude i fancied his lordship would consent to the union there could never be complete silence in any spot where empress of blandings was partaking of food but something as near silence as was possible followed this speech in the rays of the lantern hugo s eyes met millicent s in hers as in his there was a look of stunned awe they had heard of faithful old servitors they had read about faithful old servitors they had seen faithful old servitors on the stage but never had they dreamed that faithful old servitors could be as faithful as this oh beach said millicent she had used the words before but how different this oh beach was from that other earlier oh beach on that occasion the exclamation had been vibrant with reproach pain disillusionment now it contained gratitude admiration an affection almost too deep for speech and the same may be said of hugo s gosh beach cried millicent you re an angel thank you miss a topper agreed hugo thank you sir however did you get such a corking idea it came to me miss i ll tell you what it is beach said hugo earnestly when you hand in your dinner pail in due course of time and may the moment be long distant you ve got to leave your brain to the nation you ve simply got to have it pickled and put in the british museum because it s the outstanding brain of the century i never heard of anything so brilliant in my life of course the old boy will be all over us he ll do anything for us said millicent this is not merely a scheme it is more it is an egg pray silence for your chairman i want to think outside the storm had passed birds were singing far away the thunder still rumbled it might have been the sound of hugo s thoughts leaping and jostling one another i ve worked it all out said hugo at length some people might say rush to the old boy now and tell him we ve found his pig i say no in my opinion we ought to hold this pig for a rising market the longer we wait the more grateful he will be give him another forty eight hours i suggest and he will have reached the stage where he will deny us nothing but no act precipitately and we are undone don t forget that it is not merely a question of getting your uncle s consent to our union we ve got to break it to him that you aren t going to marry ronnie and the family have always been pretty keen on your marrying ronnie to my mind another forty eight hours at the very least is essential perhaps you re right i know i m right then we ll simply leave the empress here no said hugo decidedly this place doesn t strike me as safe if we found her here anybody might we require a new safe deposit and i know the very one it s beach came out of the silence his manner betrayed agitation if it is all the same to you sir i would much prefer not to hear it eh it would be a great relief to me sir to be able to expunge the entire matter from my mind i have been under a considerable mental strain of late sir and i really don t think i could bear any more of it besides supposing i were questioned sir it may be my imagination but i have rather fancied from the way he has looked at me occasionally that mr baxter harbours suspicions baxter always harbours suspicions about something said millicent yes miss but in this case they are well grounded and if it is all the same to you and mr carmody i would greatly prefer that he was not in a position to go on harbouring them all right beach said hugo after what you have done for us your lightest wish is law you can be out of this if you want to though i was going to suggest that if you cared to go on feeding the animal no sir really if you please right ho then come along millicent we must be shifting are you going to take her away now this very moment i pass this handkerchief through the handy ring which you observe in the nose and ho allez oop good bye beach it is a far far better thing that i do than i have ever done i think good bye beach said millicent i can t tell you how grateful we are i am glad to have given satisfaction miss i wish you every success and happiness sir left alone the butler drew in his breath till he swelled like a balloon then poured it out again in a long sighing puff he picked up the lantern and left the cottage his walk was the walk of a butler from whose shoulders a great weight has rolled v it is a fact not generally known for a nice sense of the dignity of his position restrained him from exercising it that beach possessed a rather attractive singing voice it was a mellow baritone in timbre not unlike that which might have proceeded from a cask of very old dry sherry had it had vocal chords and we can not advance a more striking proof of the lightness of heart which had now come upon him than by mentioning that as he walked home through the wood he broke his rigid rule and definitely warbled there s a light in thy bow er sang beach a light in thy bow er he felt more like a gay young second footman than a butler of years standing he listened to the birds with an uplifted heart upon the rabbits that sported about his path he bestowed a series of indulgent smiles the shadow that had darkened his life had passed away his conscience was at rest so completely was this so that when on reaching the house he was informed by footman james that lord emsworth had been inquiring for him and desired his immediate presence in the library he did not even tremble a brief hour ago and what menace this announcement would have seemed to him to hold but now it left him calm it was with some little difficulty that as he mounted the stairs he kept himself from resuming his song er beach your lordship the butler now became aware that his employer was not alone dripping in an unpleasant manner on the carpet for he seemed somehow to have got himself extremely wet stood the efficient baxter beach regarded him with a placid eye what was baxter to him or he to baxter now your lordship he said again for lord emsworth appeared to be experiencing some difficulty in continuing the conversation eh what what oh yes the ninth earl braced himself with a visible effort er beach your lordship i er i sent for you beach yes your lordship at this moment lord emsworth s eye fell on a volume on the desk dealing with diseases in pigs he seemed to draw strength from it beach he said in quite a crisp masterful voice i sent for you because mr baxter has made a remarkable charge against you most extraordinary i should be glad to be acquainted with the gravamen of the accusation your lordship the what asked lord emsworth starting if your lordship would be kind enough to inform me of the substance of mr baxter s charge oh the substance yes you mean the substance precisely quite so the substance yes to be sure quite so quite so yes exactly no doubt it was plain to the butler that his employer had begun to dodder left to himself this human cuckoo clock would go maundering on like this indefinitely respectfully but with the necessary firmness he called him to order what is it that mr baxter says your lordship eh oh tell him baxter yes tell him dash it the efficient baxter moved a step closer and began to drip on another part of the carpet his spectacles gleamed determinedly here was no stammering embarrassed peer of the realm but a man who knew his own mind and could speak it i followed you to the gamekeeper s cottage in the west wood just now beach sir you heard what i said undoubtedly sir but i fancied i must be mistaken i have not been to the spot you mention sir i saw you with my own eyes i can only repeat my asseveration sir said the butler with a saintly meekness lord emsworth who had taken another look at diseases in pigs became brisk again he says he peeped through the window dash it beach raised a respectful eyebrow it was as if he had said that it was not his place to comment on the pastimes of the castle s guests however childish if mr baxter wished to go out into the woods in the rain and play solitary games of peep bo that said the eyebrow was a matter that concerned mr baxter alone and you were in there he says feeding the empress your lordship and you were in there dash it you heard i beg your pardon your lordship but i really fail to comprehend well if you want it in a nutshell mr baxter says it was you who stole my pig there were few things in the world that the butler considered worth raising both eyebrows at this was one of the few he stood for a moment exhibiting them to lord emsworth then turned to baxter so that he could see them too this done he lowered them and permitted about three eighths of a smile to play for a moment about his lips might i speak frankly your lordship dash it man we want you to speak frankly that s the whole idea that s why i sent for you we want a full confession and the name of your accomplice and all that sort of thing i hesitate only because what i should like to say may possibly give offence to mr baxter your lordship which would be the last thing i should desire the prospect of offending the efficient baxter which caused such concern to beach appeared to disturb his lordship not at all get on say what you like well then your lordship i think it possible that mr baxter if he will pardon my saying so may have been suffering from a hallucination tchah said the efficient baxter you mean he s potty said lord emsworth struck with the idea in the excitement of his late secretary s information he had overlooked this simple explanation now there came surging back to him all the evidence that went to support such a theory those flower pots that leap from the library window he looked at baxter keenly there was a sort of wild gleam in his eyes the old coot glitter really lord emsworth oh i m not saying you are my dear fellow only it is quite obvious to me said baxter stiffly that this man is lying wait he continued raising a hand are you prepared to come with his lordship and me to the cottage now at this very moment and let his lordship see for himself no sir ha i should first said beach wish to go downstairs and get my hat quite right agreed lord emsworth cordially very sensible might catch a nasty cold in the head certainly get your hat beach and meet us at the front door very good your lordship a bystander observing the little party that was gathered some five minutes later on the gravel outside the great door of blandings castle would have noticed about it a touch of chill a certain restraint none of its three members seemed really in the mood for a ramble through the woods beach though courtly was not cordial the face under his bowler hat was the face of a good man misjudged baxter was eying the sullen sky as though he suspected it of something as for lord emsworth he had just become conscious that he was about to accompany through dark and deserted ways one who though on this afternoon s evidence the trend of his tastes seemed to be toward suicide might quite possibly become homicidal one moment said lord emsworth he scuttled into the house again and came out looking happier he was carrying a stout walking stick with an ivory knob on it chapter xiii i blandings castle basked in the afterglow of a golden summer evening only a memory now was the storm which two hours since had raged with such violence through its parks pleasure grounds and messuages it had passed leaving behind it peace and bird song and a sunset of pink and green and orange and opal and amethyst the air was cool and sweet and the earth sent up a healing fragrance little stars were peeping down from a rain washed sky to ronnie fish slumped in an armchair in his bedroom on the second floor the improved weather conditions brought no spiritual uplift he could see the sunset but it left him cold he could hear the thrushes calling in the shrubberies but did not think much of them it is in short in no sunny mood that we reintroduce ronald overbury fish to the reader of this chronicle the meditation of a man who has recently proposed to and been accepted by a girl some inches taller than himself for whom he entertains no warmer sentiment than a casual feeling that take her for all in all she isn t a bad sort of egg must of necessity tend toward the sombre and the surroundings in which ronnie had spent the latter part of the afternoon had not been of a kind to encourage optimism at the moment when the skies suddenly burst asunder and the world became a shower bath he had been walking along the path that skirted the wall of the kitchen garden and the only shelter that offered itself was a gloomy cave or dugout that led to the heating apparatus of the hothouses into this he had dived like a homing rabbit and here sitting on a heap of bricks he had remained for the space of fifty minutes with no company but one small green frog and his thoughts the place was a sort of sargasso sea into which had drifted all the flotsam and jetsam of the kitchen garden which adjoined there was a wheelbarrow lacking its wheel and lying drunkenly on its side there were broken pots in great profusion there were a heap of withered flowers a punctured watering can a rake with large gaps in its front teeth some potatoes unfit for human consumption and half a dead blackbird the whole effect was extraordinarily like hell and ronnie s spirits not high at the start had sunk lower and lower sobered by rain wheelbarrows watering cans rakes potatoes and dead blackbirds not to mention the steady supercilious eye of a frog which resembled that of a bishop at the athen um inspecting a shy new member ronnie had begun definitely to repent of the impulse which had led him to ask millicent to be his wife and now in the cosier environment of his bedroom he was regretting it more than ever like most people who have made a defiant and dramatic gesture and then have leisure to reflect he was oppressed by a feeling that he had gone considerably farther than was prudent samson as he heard the pillars of the temple begin to crack must have felt the same gestures are all very well while the intoxication lasts the trouble is that it lasts such a very little while in asking millicent to marry him he had gone he now definitely realized too far he had overdone it it was not that he had any objection to millicent as a wife he had none whatever provided she were somebody else s wife what was so unpleasant was the prospect of being married to her himself he groaned in spirit and became aware that he was no longer alone the door had opened and his friend hugo carmody was in the room he noted with a dull surprise that hugo was in the conventional costume of the english gentleman about to dine he had not supposed the hour so late hullo said hugo not dressed that gong s gone it now became clear to ronnie that he simply was not equal to facing his infernal family at the dinner table he supposed that millicent had spread the news of their engagement by this time and that meant discussion wearisome congratulations embraces from his aunt constance chaff of the vintage of from his uncle galahad in short fuss and gabble and he was in no mood for fuss and gabble pot luck with a tableful of trappist monks he might just have endured but not a hearty feed with the family i don t want any dinner no dinner no ill or something no but you don t want any dinner i see rummy however your affair of course it begins to look as if i should have to don the nosebag alone beach tells me that baxter also will be absent from the trough he s upset about something it seems and has asked for a snort and sandwiches in the smoking room and as for the pustule pilbeam said hugo grimly i propose to interview him at the earliest possible date and after that he won t want any dinner either where are the rest of them didn t you know said hugo surprised they re dining over at old parsloe s your aunt lord emsworth old galahad and millicent he coughed a moment of some slight embarrassment impended i say ronnie old man while on the subject of millicent well you know that engagement of yours what about it it s off off right off a washout she s changed her mind what yes she s going to marry me i may tell you we have been engaged for weeks one of those secret betrothals but we had a row row now over complete reconciliation so she asked me to break it to you gently that in the circs she proposes to return you to store a thrill of ecstasy shot through ronnie he felt as men on the scaffold feel when the messenger bounds in with the reprieve well that s the first bit of good news i ve had for a long time he said you mean you didn t want to marry millicent of course i didn t not so much of the of course laddie said hugo offended she s an awfully nice girl an angel shropshire s leading seraph but i m not in love with her any more than she s in love with me in that case said hugo with justifiable censure why propose to her a goofy proceeding it seems to me he clicked his tongue of course this is what happened you grabbed millicent to score off sue and she grabbed you to score off me and now i suppose you ve fixed it up with sue again very sound couldn t have made a wiser move she s obviously the girl for you ronnie winced the words had touched a nerve he had been trying not to think of sue but without success her picture insisted on rising before him not being able to exclude her from his thoughts he had tried to think of her bitterly i haven t he cried extraordinary how difficult it was even now to think bitterly of sue sue was sue that was the fundamental fact that hampered him try as he might to concentrate it on the tragedy of mario s restaurant his mind insisted on slipping back to earlier scenes of sunshine and happiness you haven t said hugo damped that ronnie could possibly be in ignorance of sue s arrival at the castle never occurred to him long ere this he took it for granted they must have met and he assumed from the equanimity with which his friend had received the news of the loss of millicent that sue and he must have had just such another heart to heart talk as had taken place in the room above the gamekeeper s cottage the dour sullenness of ronnie s face made his kindly heart sink you mean you haven t fixed things up no ronnie writhed sue in his car sue up the river sue in his arms to the music of sweet saxophones sue laughing sue smiling sue in the springtime with the little breezes ruffling her hair he forced his mind away from these weakening visions sue at mario s that was better sue letting him down sue hobnobbing with the blister pilbeam that was much better i think you re being very hard on that poor little girl ronnie don t call her a poor little girl i will call her a poor little girl said hugo firmly to me she is a poor little girl and i don t care who knows it i don t mind telling you that my heart bleeds for her bleeds profusely and i must say i should have thought i don t want to talk about her after her doing what she has done i don t want to talk about her i tell you hugo sighed he gave it up the situation was what they called an impasse too bad his best friend and a dear little girl like that parted forever two jolly good eggs sundered for all eternity oh well that was life if you want to talk about anything said ronnie you had much better talk about this engagement of yours only too glad old man was afraid it might bore you or would have touched more freely on subject i suppose you realize the family will squash it flat oh no they won t you think my aunt constance is going to leap about and bang the cymbals the keeble i admit said hugo with a faint shiver may make her presence felt to some extent but i rely on the ninth earl s support and patronage before long i shall be causing the ninth to look on me as a son how for a moment hugo almost yielded to the temptation to confide in this friend of his youth then he realized the unwisdom of such a course by an odd coincidence he was thinking exactly the same of ronnie as ronnie at an earlier stage of this history had thought of him ronnie he considered though a splendid chap was not fitted to be a repository of secrets a babbler a sieve the sort of fellow who would spread a secret hither and thither all over the place before nightfall never mind he said i have my methods what are they just methods said hugo and jolly good ones well i ll be pushing off i m late sure you won t come down to dinner then i ll be going it is imperative that i get hold of pilbeam with all possible speed don t want the sun to go down on my wrath all has ended happily in spite of him but that s no reason why he shouldn t be massacred i look on myself as a man with a public duty for some minutes after the door had closed ronnie remained humped in his chair then in spite of everything there began to creep upon him a desire for food too strong to be resisted perfect health and a tealess afternoon spent in the open had given him a compelling appetite he still shrank from the thought of the dining room fond as he was of hugo he simply could not stand his conversation to night a chop at the emsworth arms would meet the case he could get down there in five minutes in his two seater he rose his mind as he moved to the door was not entirely occupied with thoughts of food hugo s parting words had turned it in the direction of pilbeam again what had brought pilbeam to the castle he did not know but now that he was here let him look out for himself a couple of minutes alone with p frobisher pilbeam was just the medicine his bruised soul required apparently from what he had said hugo also entertained some grievances against the man it could be nothing compared with his own pilbeam the cause of all his troubles pilbeam the snake in the grass pilbeam yes his heart might be broken his life a wreck but he could still enjoy the faint consolation of dealing faithfully with pilbeam he went out into the corridor and as he did so percy pilbeam came out of the room opposite ii pilbeam had dressed for dinner with considerable care owing to the fact that lord emsworth in his woolen headed way had completely forgotten to inform him of the exodus to matchingham hall he was expecting to meet a gay and glittering company at the meal and had prepared himself accordingly looking at the result in the mirror he had felt a glow of contentment this glow was still warming him as he passed into the corridor as his eyes fell on ronnie it faded abruptly in the days of his editorship of society spice that frank and fearless journal p frobisher pilbeam had once or twice had personal encounters with people having no cause to wish him well they had not appealed to him he was a man who found no pleasure in physical violence and that physical violence threatened now was only too sickeningly plain it was foreshadowed in the very manner in which this small but sturdy young man confronting him had begun to creep forward pilbeam who was an f r z s had seen leopards at the zoo creep just like that years of conducting a weekly scandal sheet followed by a long period of activity as a private inquiry agent undoubtedly train a man well for the exhibition of presence of mind in sudden emergencies one finds it difficult in the present instance to overpraise percy pilbeam s ready resource had a great military strategist been present he would have nodded approval with the grim menace of ronnie fish coming closer and closer percy pilbeam did exactly what napoleon hannibal or the great duke of marlborough would have done reaching behind him for the handle and twisting it sharply he slipped through the door of his bedroom banged it and was gone many an eel has disappeared into the mud with less smoothness and celerity if the leopard which he resembled had seen its prey vanish into the undergrowth just before dinner time it would probably have expressed its feelings in exactly the same kind of short rasping cry as proceeded from ronnie fish witnessing this masterly withdrawal for an instant he was completely taken aback then he plunged for the door and into the room he stood baffled pilbeam had vanished to ronnie s astonished eyes the apartment appeared entirely free from detectives in any shape or form whatsoever there was the bed there were the chairs there were the carpet the dressing table and the bookshelf but of private inquiry agents there was a complete shortage how long this miracle would have continued to afflict him one can not say his mind was still dealing dazedly with it when there came to his ears a sharp click as of a key being turned in the lock it seemed to proceed from a hanging cupboard at the other side of the room old miles fish ronnie s father might as lord emsworth had asserted have been the biggest fool in the brigade of guards but his son could reason and deduce springing forward he tugged at the handle of the cupboard door the door stood fast at the same moment there filtered through it the sound of muffled breathing ronnie was already looking grim he now looked grimmer he placed his lips to the panel come out of that the breathing stopped all right said ronnie with a hideous calm right jolly ho i can wait for some moments there was silence then from the beyond a voice spoke in reply be reasonable said the voice reasonable said ronnie thickly reasonable eh he choked come out i only want to pull your head off he added with a note of appeal the voice became conciliatory i know what you re upset about it said you do eh yes i quite understand but i can explain everything what i say i can explain everything you can can you quite said the voice up till now ronnie had been pulling it now occurred to him that pushing might possibly produce more satisfactory results so he pushed nothing however happened blandings castle was a house which rather prided itself on its solidity its walls were walls and its doors doors no jimcrack work here the cupboard creaked but did not yield i say well i wish you d listen i tell you i can explain everything about that night at mario s i mean i know exactly how it is you think miss brown is fond of me i give you my solemn word she can t stand the sight of me she told me so herself a pleasing thought came to ronnie you can t stay in there all night he said i don t want to stay in here all night well come on out then the voice became plaintive i tell you she had never set eyes on me before that night at mario s she was dining with that fellow carmody and he went out and i came over and introduced myself no harm in that was there ronnie wondered if kicking would do any good a tender feeling for his toes coupled with the reflection that his uncle clarence might have something to say if he started breaking up cupboard doors caused him to abandon the scheme he stood breathing tensely just a friendly word that s all i came over to say why shouldn t a fellow introduce himself to a girl and say a friendly word i wish i d got there earlier i d have been glad to see you said pilbeam courteously would you quite i shall be glad to see you said ronnie when i can get this damned door open pilbeam began to fear asphyxiation the air inside the cupboard was growing closer peril lent him the inspiration which it so often does look here he said are you ronnie ronnie turned pinker i don t want any of your dashed cheek no but listen is your name ronnie silence without because if it is said pilbeam you re the fellow she s come here to see more silence she told me so in the garden this evening she came here calling herself miss shoemaker or some such name just to see you that ought to show you that i m not the man she s keen on the silence was broken by a sharp exclamation what s that pilbeam repeated his remark a growing hopefulness lent an almost finicky clearness to his diction come out cried ronnie that s all very well but come out i want to talk to you you are talking to me i don t want to bellow this through a door come on out i swear i won t touch you it was not so much pilbeam s faith in the knightly word of the fishes that caused him to obey the request as a feeling that if he stayed cooped up in this cupboard much longer he would get a rush of blood to the head already he was beginning to feel as if he were breathing a solution of dust and mothballs he emerged his hair was rumpled and he regarded his companion warily he had the air of a man who has taken his life in his hands but the word of the fishes held good as far as ronnie was concerned the war appeared to be over what did you say she s here quite what do you mean quite certainly quite she got here just before i did haven t you seen her no well she s here she s in the room they call the garden room i heard her tell that old bird galahad so if you go there now said pilbeam insinuatingly you could have a quiet word with her before she goes down to dinner and she said she had come here to see me yes to explain about that night at mario s and what i say proceeded pilbeam warmly is if a girl didn t love a fellow would she come to a place like this calling herself miss shoolbred or something simply to see him i ask you said pilbeam ronnie did not answer his feelings held him speechless he was too deep in a morass of remorse to be able to articulate indeed he was in a frame of mind so abased that he almost asked pilbeam to kick him the thought of how he had wronged his blameless sue was almost too bitter to be borne it bit like a serpent and stung like an adder from the surge and riot of his reflections one thought now emerged clearly shining like a beacon on a dark night the garden room turning without a word he shot out of the door as quickly as percy pilbeam a short while ago had shot in and percy pilbeam with a deep sigh went to the dressing table took up the brush and started to restore his hair to a state fit for the eyes of the nobility and gentry this done he smoothed his moustache and went downstairs to the drawing room iii the drawing room was empty and to pilbeam s surprise it continued to be empty for quite a considerable time he felt puzzled he had expected to meet a reproachful host with an eye on the clock and a haughty hostess clicking her tongue as the minutes crept by and his solitude remained unbroken he began to grow restless he wandered about the room staring at the pictures straightening his tie and examining the photographs on the little tables the last of these was one of lord emsworth taken apparently at about the age of thirty in long whiskers and the uniform of the shropshire yeomanry he was gazing at this with the fascinated horror which it induced in everyone who saw it suddenly for the first time when the door at last opened and with a sinking sensation of apprehension pilbeam beheld the majestic form of beach for an instant he stood eying the butler with that natural alarm which comes to all of us when in the presence of a man who a few short hours earlier has given us one look and made us feel like a condemned food product then his tension relaxed it has been well said that for every evil in this world nature supplies an antidote if butlers come can cocktails be far behind beach was carrying a tray with glasses and a massive shaker on it and pilbeam seeing these found himself regarding their formidable bearer almost with equanimity a cocktail sir thanks he accepted a brimming glass the darkness of its contents suggested a welcome strength he drank and instantaneously all through his system beacon fires seemed to burst into being he drained the glass his whole outlook on life was now magically different quite suddenly he had begun to feel equal to a dozen butlers however glazed their eyes might be and it might have been an illusion caused by gin and vermouth but this butler seemed to have changed considerably for the better since their last meeting his eye though still glassy had lost the old basilisk quality there appeared now in fact to be something so positively light hearted about beach s whole demeanour that the proprietor of the argus enquiry agency was emboldened to plunge into conversation nice evening yes sir nice after the storm yes sir came down a bit didn t it the rain was undoubtedly extremely heavy sir another cocktail thanks the relighting of the beacons had the effect of removing from pilbeam the last trace of diffidence and shyness he saw now that he had been entirely mistaken in this butler encountering him in the hall at the moment of his arrival he had supposed him supercilious and hostile he now perceived that he was a butler and a brother more like old king cole that jolly old soul indeed than anybody pilbeam had met for months i got caught in it he said affably indeed sir yes lord emsworth had been showing me some photographs of that pig of his by the way in strict confidence what s your name beach sir in strict confidence beach i know something about that pig indeed sir yes well after i had seen the photographs i went for a walk in the park and the rain came on and i got pretty wet in fact i don t mind telling you i had to get under cover and take my trousers off to dry he laughed merrily another cocktail sir making three in all yes sir perhaps you re right said pilbeam for some moments he sat pensive and distrait listening to the strains of a brass band which seemed to have started playing somewhere in the vicinity then his idly floating thoughts drifted back to the mystery which had been vexing him before this delightful butler s entry i say beach i ve been waiting here hours and hours where s this dinner i heard you beating gongs about dinner is ready sir but i put it back some little while as gentlemen aren t punctual in the summer time pilbeam considered this statement it sounded to him as if it would make rather a good song title gentlemen aren t punctual in the summer time in the summer time i said in the summertime so take me back to that old kentucky shack he tried to fit it to the music which the brass band was playing but it did not go very well and he gave it up where is everybody he asked his lordship and her ladyship and mr galahad and miss threepwood are dining at matchingham hall what with old pop parsloe with sir gregory parsloe parsloe yes sir pilbeam chuckled well well well quick worker old parsloe don t you think so beach i mean you advise him to do a thing to act in a certain way to adopt a certain course of action and he does it right away you agree with me beach i fear my limited acquaintance with sir gregory scarcely entitles me to offer an opinion sir talking of old parsloe beach you did say your name was beach yes sir with a capital b yes sir well talking of old parsloe beach i could tell you something about him something he s up to indeed sir but i m not going to respect client s confidence lips sealed professional secret yes sir as you rightly say yes any more of that stuff in the shaker beach a little sir if you consider it judicious that s just what i do consider it start pouring the detective sipped luxuriously fuller and fuller every moment of an uplifting sense of well being if the friendship which had sprung up between himself and the butler was possibly a little one sided on the one side on which it did exist it was warm even fervent it seemed to pilbeam that for the first time since he had arrived at blandings castle he had found a real chum a kindred soul in whom he might confide and he was filled with an overwhelming desire to confide in somebody as a matter of fact beach he said i could tell you all sorts of things about all sorts of people practically everybody in this house i could tell you something about what s the name of that chap with the light hair for instance the old boy s secretary mr carmody sir carmody that s the name i ve been trying to remember it well i could tell you something about carmody indeed sir yes something about carmody that would interest you very much i saw carmody this afternoon when carmody didn t see me indeed sir yes where is carmody i imagine he will be down shortly sir mr ronald also ronald pilbeam drew in his breath sharply there s a tough baby beach that ronnie do you know what he wanted to do just now murder me in beach s opinion for he did not look on percy pilbeam as a very necessary member of society this would have been a commendable act and he regretted that its consummation had been prevented he was also feeling that the conscientious butler he had always prided himself on being would long ere this have withdrawn and left this man to talk to himself but even the best of butlers have human emotions and the magic of pilbeam s small talk held beach like a spell it reminded him of the gossip page of society spice a paper to which he was a regular subscriber he was piqued and curious so far it was true his companion had merely hinted but something seemed to tell him that if he lingered on a really sensational news item would shortly emerge he had never been more right in his life pilbeam by this time had finished the fourth cocktail and the urge to confide had become overpowering he looked at beach and it nearly made him cry to think that he was holding anything back from such a splendid fellow and do you know why he wanted to murder me beach it scarcely seemed to the butler that the action required anything in the nature of a reasoned explanation but he murmured the necessary response i could not say sir of course you couldn t how could you you don t know that s why i m telling you well listen he s in love with a girl in the chorus at the regal a girl named sue brown and he thought i had been taking her out to dinner that s why he wanted to murder me beach indeed sir the butler spoke calmly but he was deeply stirred he had always flattered himself that the inmates of blandings castle kept few secrets from him but this was something new yes that was why i had the dickens of a job holding him off i can tell you do you know what saved me beach no sir presence of mind i put it to him to ronnie i put it to ronnie as a reasonable man that if this girl loved me would she have come to this place pretending to be miss shoemaker simply so as to see him sir yes that s who miss shoemaker is beach she s a chorus girl called sue brown and she s come here to see ronnie beach stood transfixed his eyes swelled bulbously from their sockets he was incapable of even an indeed sir he was still endeavouring to assimilate this extraordinary revelation when hugo carmody entered the room ah said hugo his eye falling on pilbeam he stiffened he stood looking at the detective like schopenhauer s butcher at the selected lamb leave us beach he said in a grave deep voice the butler came out of his trance sir pop off very good sir the door closed i ve been looking for you viper said hugo have you carmody said percy pilbeam effervescently i ve been looking for you too got something i want to talk to you about each looking for each or am i thinking of a couple of other fellows come right in carmody and sit down good old carmody jolly old carmody splendid old carmody well well well well well if the lamb mentioned above had suddenly accosted the above mentioned butcher in a similar strain of hearty camaraderie it could have hardly disconcerted him more than pilbeam with these cheery words disconcerted hugo his stern set gaze became a gaping stare then he pulled himself together what did words matter he had no time to bother about words action was what he was after action i don t know if you re aware of it worm he said but you came jolly near to blighting my life doing what carmody blighting my life list to me while i tell you of the spaniard who blighted my life sang percy pilbeam letting it go like a lark in the springtime he had never felt happier or in more congenial society how did i blight your life carmody you didn t you said i did i said you tried to make up your mind carmody don t keep calling me carmody but carmody protested pilbeam it s your name isn t it certainly it is then why try to hush it up carmody be frank and open i don t mind people knowing my name i glory in it it s pilbeam pilbeam pilbeam that s what it is pilbeam in about thirty seconds said hugo it will be mud it struck percy pilbeam for the first time that in his companion s manner there was a certain peevishness something the matter he asked concerned i ll tell you what s the matter do carmody do said pilbeam do do do confide in me i like your face he settled himself in a deep armchair and putting the tips of his fingers together after a little preliminary difficulty in making them meet leaned back all readiness to listen to whatever trouble it was that was disturbing this new friend of his some days ago insect pilbeam opened his eyes speak up carmody he said don t mumble hugo s fingers twitched he regarded his companion with a burning eye and wondered why he was wasting time talking instead of at once proceeding to the main business of the day and knocking the fellow s head off at the roots what saved pilbeam was the reclining position he had assumed if you are a carmody and a sportsman you can not attack even a viper if it persists in lying back on its spine and keeping its eyes shut some days ago he began again i called at your office and after we had talked of this and that i left i discovered later that immediately upon my departure you had set your foul spies on my trail and had instructed them to take notes of my movements and report on them the result being that i came jolly close to having my bally life ruined and if you want to know what i m going to do i m going to haul you out of that chair and turn you round and kick you hard and go on kicking you till i kick you out of the house and if you dare to shove your beastly little nose back inside the place i ll disembowel you pilbeam unclosed his eyes nothing he said could be fairer than that nevertheless that s no reason why you should go about stealing pigs hugo had often read stories in which people reeled and would have fallen had they not clutched at whatever it was that they clutched at he had never expected to undergo that experience himself but it is undoubtedly the fact that if he had not at this moment gripped the back of a chair he would have been hard put to it to remain perpendicular pig pincher said pilbeam austerely and closed his eyes again hugo having established his equilibrium by means of the chair had now moved away he was making a strong effort to recover his morale he picked up the photograph of lord emsworth in his yeomanry uniform and looked at it absently then as if it had just dawned upon him put it down with a shudder like a man who finds that he has been handling a snake what do you mean he said thickly pilbeam s eyes opened what do i mean what do you think i mean i mean you re a pig pincher that s what i mean you go to and fro sneaking pigs and hiding them in caravans hugo took up lord emsworth s photograph again saw what he was doing and dropped it quickly pilbeam had closed his eyes once more and looking at him hugo could not repress a reluctant thrill of awe he had often read about the superhuman intuition of detectives but he had never before been privileged to observe it in operation then an idea occurred to him did you see me what say carmody did you see me yes i see you carmody said pilbeam playfully peep bo did you see me put that pig in the caravan pilbeam nodded eleven times in rapid succession certainly i saw you carmody why shouldn t i see you considering i d been caught in the rain and taken shelter in the caravan and was in there with my trousers off trying to dry them because i m subject to lumbago i didn t see you no carmody you did not and i ll tell you why carmody because i heard a girl s voice outside saying be quick or somebody will come along and i hid you don t suppose i would let a sweet girl see me in knee length mesh knit underwear do you not done carmody said pilbeam severely not cricket hugo was experiencing the bitterness which comes to all criminals who discover too late that they have undone themselves by trying to be clever it had seemed at the time such a good idea to remove the empress from the gamekeeper s cottage in the west wood and place her in baxter s caravan where nobody would think of looking how could he have anticipated that the caravan would be bulging with blighted detectives at this tense moment the door opened and beach appeared i beg your pardon sir but do you propose to wait any longer for mr ronald eh certainly not said pilbeam who the devil s mr ronald i should like to know i didn t come to this place to do a fast cure i want my dinner and i want it now and if mr ronald doesn t like it he can do the other thing he strode in a dominating manner to the door come along carmody din dins hugo had sunk into a chair i don t want any dinner he said dully you don t want any dinner no no dinner no pilbeam shrugged his shoulders impatiently the man s an ass he said he headed for the stairs his manner seemed to indicate that he washed his hands of hugo beach lingered shall i bring you some sandwiches sir no thanks what s that a loud crash had sounded the butler went to the door and looked out it is mr pilbeam sir he appears to have fallen downstairs for an instant a look of hope crept into hugo s careworn face has he broken his neck apparently not sir ah said hugo regretfully chapter xiv i the efficient baxter had retired to the smoking room shortly before half past seven he desired silence and solitude and in this cosy haven he got both for a few minutes nothing broke the stillness but the slow ticking of a clock on the mantelpiece then from the direction of the hall there came a new sound faint at first but swelling and swelling to a frenzied blare seeming to throb through the air with a note of passionate appeal like a woman wailing for her demon lover it was that tocsin of the soul that muezzin of the country house the dressing for dinner gong baxter did not stir the summons left him unmoved he had heard it of course butler beach was a man who swung a pretty gong stick he had that quick forearm flick and wristy follow through which stamp the master if you were anywhere within a quarter of a mile or so you could not help hearing him but the sound had no appeal for baxter he did not propose to go in to dinner he wanted to be alone with his thoughts they were not the sort of thoughts with which most men would have wished to be left alone being both dark and bitter that expedition to the gamekeeper s cottage in the west wood had not proved a pleasure trip for rupert baxter reviewing it in his mind he burned with baffled rage and yet everybody had been very nice to him very nice and tactful true at the moment of the discovery that the cottage contained no pig and appeared to have been pigless from its foundation there had been perhaps just the slightest suspicion of constraint lord emsworth had grasped his ivory knobbed stick a little more tightly and had edged behind beach in a rather noticeable way his manner saying more plainly than was agreeable if he springs be ready and there had come into the butler s face a look hard to bear which was a blend of censure and pity but after that both of them had been charming lord emsworth had talked soothingly about light and shade effects he had said and beach had agreed with him that in the darkness of a thunderstorm anybody might have been deceived into supposing that he had seen a butler feeding a pig in the gamekeeper s cottage it was probably said lord emsworth and beach thought so too a bit of wood sticking out of the wall or something he went on to tell a longish story of how he himself when a boy had fancied he had seen a cat with flaming eyes he had concluded by advising baxter and beach said the suggestion was a good one to hurry home and have a nice cup of hot tea and go to bed his attitude in short could not have been pleasanter or more considerate yet baxter as he sat in the smoking room burned as stated with baffled rage the door handle turned beach stood on the threshold if you have changed your mind sir about taking dinner the meal is quite ready he spoke as friend to friend there was nothing in his manner to suggest that the man he addressed had ever accused him of stealing pigs as far as beach was concerned all was forgotten and forgiven but the milk of human kindness of which the butler was so full had not yet been delivered on baxter s doorstep the hostility in his eye as he fixed it on his visitor was so marked that a lesser man than beach might have been disconcerted i don t want any dinner very good sir bring me that whisky and soda quick yes sir the door closed as softly as it had opened but not before a pang like a red hot needle had pierced the ex secretary s bosom it was caused by the fact that he had distinctly heard the butler as he withdrew utter a pitying sigh it was the sort of sigh which a kind hearted man would have given on peeping into a padded cell in which some old friend was confined and baxter resented it with all the force of an imperious nature he had not ceased to wonder what if anything could be done about it when the refreshments arrived carried by james the footman james placed them gently on the table shot a swift glance of respectful commiseration at the patient and passed away the sigh had cut baxter like a knife the look stabbed him like a dagger for a moment he thought of calling the man back and asking him what the devil he meant by staring at him like that but wiser counsels prevailed he contented himself with draining a glass of whisky and soda and swallowing two sandwiches this done he felt a little not much but a little better before he would gladly have murdered beach and james and danced on their graves now he would have been satisfied with straight murder however he was alone at last that was some slight consolation beach had come and gone footman james had come and gone everybody else must by now be either at matchingham hall or assembled in the dining room on the solitude which he so greatly desired there could be no further intrusion he resumed his meditations for a time these dealt exclusively with the recent past and were in consequence of a morbid character then as the grateful glow of the whisky began to make itself felt a softer mood came to rupert baxter his mind turned to thoughts of sue men as efficient as rupert baxter do not fall in love in the generally accepted sense of the term their attitude toward the tender passion is more restrained than that of the ordinary feckless young man who loses his heart at first sight with a whoop and a shiver baxter approved of sue we can not say more but this approval added to the fact that he had been informed by lady constance that the girl was the only daughter of a man who possessed sixty million dollars had been enough to cause him to earmark her in his mind as the future mrs baxter in that capacity he had docketed her and filed her away at the first moment of their meeting naturally therefore the remarks which lord emsworth had let fall in her hearing had caused him grave concern it hampers a man in his wooing if the girl he has selected for his bride starts with the idea that he is as mad as a coot he congratulated himself on the promptitude with which he had handled the situation that letter which he had written her could not fail to put him right in her eyes rupert baxter was a man in whose lexicon there was no such word as failure an heiress like this miss schoonmaker would not he was aware lack for suitors but he did not fear them if only she were making a reasonably long stay at the castle he felt that he could rely on his force of character to win the day in fact it seemed to him that he could almost hear the wedding bells ringing already then coming out of his dreams he realized that it was the telephone he reached for the instrument with a frown annoyed at the interruption and spoke with an irritated sharpness hullo a ghostly voice replied the storm seemed to have effected the wires speak up barked baxter he banged the telephone violently on the table the treatment as is so often the case proved effective blandings castle said the voice no longer ghostly yes post office market blandings speaking telegram for lady constance keeble i will take it the voice became faint again baxter went through the movements as before lady constance keeble blandings castle market blandings shropshire england said the voice recovering strength as if it had shaken off a wasting sickness handed in at paris where paris france oh well the voice gathered volume terribly sorry hear news what news yes terribly sorry hear news stop quite understand stop so disappointed shall be unable come to you later as going back america at end of month stop do hope we shall be able arrange something when i return next year stop regards stop yes signed myra schoonmaker signed what myra schoonmaker baxter s mouth had fallen open the forehead above the spectacles was wrinkled the eyes behind them staring blankly and with a growing horror shall i repeat what do you wish the message repeated no said baxter in a choking voice he hung up the receiver there seemed to be something crawling down his back his brain was numbed myra schoonmaker telegraphing from paris then who was this girl who was at the castle calling herself by that preposterous name an impostor an adventuress she must be and if he made a move to expose her she would revenge herself by showing lord emsworth that letter of his in the agitation of the moment he had risen to his feet he now sat down heavily that letter he must recover it he must recover it at once as long as it remained in the girl s possession it was a pistol pointed at his head once let lord emsworth become acquainted with those very frank criticisms of himself which it contained and not even his ally lady constance would be able to restore him to his lost secretaryship the ninth earl was a mild man accustomed to bowing to his sister s decrees but there were limits beyond which he could not be pushed and baxter yearned to be back at blandings castle in the position he had once enjoyed blandings was his spiritual home he had held other secretaryships he held one now at a salary far higher than that which lord emsworth had paid him but never had he succeeded in recapturing that fascinating sense of power of importance of being the man who directed the destinies of one of the largest houses in england at all costs he must recover that letter and the present moment he perceived was ideal for the venture the girl must have the thing in her room somewhere and for the next hour at least she would be in the dining room he would have ample opportunity for a search he did not delay thirty seconds later he was mounting the stairs his face set his spectacles gleaming grimly a minute later he reached his destination no good angel aware of what the future held stood on the threshold to bar his entry the door was ajar he pushed it open and went in ii blandings castle like most places of its size and importance contained bedrooms so magnificent that they were never used with their four poster beds and their superb but rather oppressive tapestries they had remained untenanted since the time when queen elizabeth dodging from country house to country house in that restless snipe like way of hers had last slept in them of the guest rooms still in commission the most luxurious was that which had been given to sue at the moment when baxter stole cautiously in it was looking its best in the gentle evening light but baxter was not in sightseeing mood he ignored the carved bedstead the easy armchairs the pictures the decorations and the soft carpet into which his feet sank the beauty of the sky through the french windows that gave onto the balcony drew but a single brief glance from him without delay he made for the writing desk which stood against the wall near the bed it seemed to him a good point of departure for his search there were several pigeonholes in the desk they contained single sheets of notepaper double sheets of notepaper postcards envelopes telegraph forms and even a little pad on which the room s occupant was presumably expected to jot down any stray thoughts and reflections on life which might occur to him or her before turning in for the night but not one of them contained the fatal letter he straightened himself and looked about the room the drawer of the dressing table now suggested itself as a possibility he left the desk and made his way toward it the primary requisite of dressing tables being a good supply of light they are usually placed in a position to get as much of it as possible this one was no exception it stood so near to the open windows that the breeze was ruffling the tassels on its lamp shades and baxter arriving in front of it was enabled for the first time to see the balcony in its entirety and as he saw it his heart seemed to side slip leaning upon the parapet and looking out over the sea of gravel that swept up to the front door from the rhododendron fringed drive stood a girl and not even the fact that her back was turned could prevent baxter identifying her for an instant he remained frozen even the greatest men congeal beneath the chill breath of the totally unexpected he had assumed as a matter of course that sue was down in the dining room and it took him several seconds to adjust his mind to the unpleasing fact that she was up on her balcony when he recovered his presence of mind sufficiently to draw noiselessly away from the line of vision his first emotion was one of irritation this chopping and changing this eleventh hour alteration of plans these sudden decisions to remain upstairs when they ought to be downstairs were what made women as a sex so unsatisfactory to irritation succeeded a sense of defeat there was nothing for it he realized but to give up his quest and go he started to tiptoe silently to the door agreeably conscious now of the softness and thickness of the axminster pile that made it possible to move unheard and had just reached it when from the other side there came to his ears a sound of chinking and clattering the sound in fact which is made by plates and dishes when they are carried on a tray to a guest who after a long railway journey has asked her hostess if she may take dinner in her room practice makes perfect this was the second time in the last three hours that baxter had found himself trapped in a room in which it was vitally urgent that he should not be discovered and he was getting the technique of the thing on the previous occasion in the small library he had taken to himself wings like a bird and sailed out of window in the present crisis such a course he perceived immediately was not feasible the way of an eagle would profit him nothing soaring over the balcony he would be observed by sue and would in addition unquestionably break his neck what was needed here was the way of a diving duck and so as the door handle turned rupert baxter even in this black hour efficient dropped on all fours and slid under the bed as smoothly as if he had been practising for weeks iii owing to the restricted nature of his position and the limited range of vision which he enjoys virtually the only way in which a man who is hiding under a bed can entertain himself is by listening to what is going on outside he may hear something of interest or he may hear only the draught sighing along the floor but for better or for worse that is all he is able to do the first sound that came to rupert baxter was that made by the placing of the tray on the table then after a pause a pair of squeaking shoes passed over the carpet and squeaked out of hearing baxter recognized them as those of footman thomas a confirmed squeaker after this somebody puffed causing him to deduce the presence of beach your dinner is quite ready miss oh thank you the girl had apparently come in from the balcony a chair scraped to the table a savoury scent floated to baxter s nostrils causing him acute discomfort he had just begun to realize how extremely hungry he was and how rash he had been first to attempt to dine off a couple of sandwiches and secondly to undertake a mission like his present one without a square meal inside him that is chicken miss en casserole baxter had deduced as much and was trying not to let his mind dwell on it he uttered a silent groan in addition to the agony of having to smell food he was beginning to be conscious of a growing cramp in his left leg he turned on one side and did his best to emulate the easy nonchalance of those indian fakirs who doubtless from the best motives spend the formative years of their lives lying on iron spikes it looks very good i trust you will enjoy it miss is there anything further that i can do for you no thank you oh yes would you mind fetching that manuscript from the balcony i was reading it out there and i left it on the chair it s mr threepwood s book indeed miss an exceedingly interesting compilation i should imagine yes very i wonder if it would be taking a liberty miss to ask you to inform me later at your leisure if i make any appearance in its pages you yes miss from what mr galahad has let fall from time to time i fancy it was his intention to give me printed credit as his authority for certain of the stories which appear in the book do you want to be in it most decidedly miss i should consider it an honour and it would please my mother have you a mother yes miss she lives at eastbourne the butler moved majestically onto the balcony and sue s mind had turned to speculation about his mother and whether she looked anything like him when there was a sound of hurrying feet without the door flew open and beach s mother passed from her mind like the unsubstantial fabric of a dream with a little choking cry she rose to her feet ronnie was standing before her chapter xv and meanwhile if we may borrow an expression from a sister act what of hugo carmody it is a defect unfortunately inseparable from any such document as this faithful record of events in and about blandings castle that the chronicler in order to give a square deal to each of the individuals whose fortunes he has undertaken to narrate is compelled to flit abruptly from one to the other in the manner popularized by the chamois of the alps leaping from crag to crag the activities of the efficient baxter seeming to him to demand immediate attention he was reluctantly compelled some little while back to leave hugo in the very act of reeling beneath a crushing blow the moment has now come to return to him the first effect on a young man of sensibility and gentle upbringing of the discovery that an unfriendly detective has seen him placing stolen pigs in caravans is to induce a stunned condition of mind a sort of mental coma the face lengthens the limbs grow rigid the tie slips sideways and the cuffs recede into the coat sleeves the subject becomes temporarily in short a total loss it is perhaps as well therefore that we did not waste valuable time watching hugo in the process of digesting percy pilbeam s sensational announcement for it would have been like looking at a statue if the reader will endeavour to picture rodin s thinker in a dinner jacket and trousers with braid down the sides he will have got the general idea at the instant when hugo carmody makes his reappearance life has just begun to return to the stiffened frame and with life came the dawning of intelligence this ghastly snag which had popped up in his path was too big reflected hugo for any man to tackle it called for a woman s keener wit his first act on emerging from the depths therefore was to leave the drawing room and totter downstairs to the telephone he got the number of matchingham hall and establishing communication with sir gregory parsloe parsloe s butler urged him to summon miss millicent threepwood from the dinner table the butler said in rather a reproving way that miss threepwood was at the moment busy drinking soup hugo with the first flash of spirit he had shown for a quarter of an hour replied that he didn t care if she was bathing in it fetch her said hugo and almost added the words you scurvy knave he then clung weakly to the receiver waiting and in a short while a sweet but agitated voice floated to him across the wire hugo millicent is that you yes is that you yes anything in the nature of misunderstanding was cleared away it was both of them what s up everything s up how do you mean i ll tell you said hugo and did so it was not a difficult story to tell its plot was so clear that a few whispered words sufficed you don t mean that said millicent the tale concluded i do mean that oh golly said millicent silence followed hugo waited palpitatingly the outlook seemed to him black he wondered if he had placed too much reliance in woman s wit that golly had not been hopeful hugo hullo this is a bit thick yes agreed hugo the thickness had not escaped him well there s only one thing to do a faint thrill passed through hugo carmody one would be enough woman s wit was going to bring home the bacon after all listen well the only thing to do is for me to go back to the dining room and tell uncle clarence you ve found the empress eh found her fathead how do you mean found her in the caravan but weren t you listening to what i was saying there were tears in hugo s voice pilbeam saw us putting her there i know well what s our move when he says so stout denial eh we stoutly deny it said millicent the thrill passed through hugo again stronger than before it might work yes properly handled it would work he poured broken words of love and praise into the receiver that s right he cried i see daylight i will go to pilbeam and tell him privily that if he opens his mouth i ll strangle him well hold on i ll go and tell uncle clarence i expect he ll be out in a moment to have a word with you half a minute millicent well when am i supposed to have found this ghastly pig ten minutes ago when you were taking a stroll before dinner you happened to pass the caravan and you heard an odd noise inside and you looked to see what it was and there was the empress and you raced back to the house to telephone but millicent half a minute well the old boy will think baxter stole her so he will isn t that splendid well hold on hugo resumed his vigil it was some moments later that a noise like the clucking of fowls broke out at the matchingham hall end of the wire he deduced correctly that this was caused by the ninth earl of emsworth endeavouring to clothe his thoughts in speech kuk kuk kuk yes lord emsworth kuk carmody yes lord emsworth is this true yes lord emsworth you ve found the empress yes lord emsworth in that feller baxter s caravan yes lord emsworth well i ll be damned yes lord emsworth so far hugo carmody had found his share of the dialogue delightfully easy on these lines he would have been prepared to continue it all night but there was something else besides yes lord emsworth that he must now endeavour to say there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune and that tide he knew would never rise higher than at the present moment he swallowed twice to unlimber his vocal chords lord emsworth he said and though his heart was beating fast his voice was steady there is something i would like to take this opportunity of saying it will come as a surprise to you but i hope not as an unpleasant surprise i love your niece millicent and she loves me lord emsworth we have loved each other for many weeks and it is my hope that you will give your consent to our marriage i am not a rich man lord emsworth in fact strictly speaking except for my salary i haven t a bean in the world but my uncle lester owns rudge hall in worcestershire i dare say you have heard of the place you turn to the left off the main road to birmingham and go about a couple of miles well anyway it s a biggish sort of place in worcestershire and my uncle lester owns it and the property is entailed and i m next in succession i won t pretend that my uncle lester shows any indications of passing in his checks he was extremely fit last time i saw him but after all he s getting on and all flesh is as grass and as i say i m next man in so i shall eventually succeed to quite a fairish bit of the stuff and a house and park and rent roll and all that so what i mean is it isn t as if i wasn t in a position to support millicent later on and if you realized lord emsworth how we love one another i m sure you would see that it wouldn t be playing the game to put any obstacles in the way of our happiness so what i m driving at if you follow me is may we charge ahead there was dead silence at the other end of the wire it seemed as if this revelation of a good man s love had struck lord emsworth dumb it was only some moments later after he had said hullo six times and i say are you there twice that it was borne in upon hugo that he had wasted two hundred and eighty words of the finest eloquence on empty space his natural chagrin at this discovery was sensibly diminished by the sudden sound of millicent s voice in his ear hullo hullo hullo hullo hugo hullo i say hugo she spoke with the joyous excitement of a girl who has just emerged from the centre of a family dog fight i say hugo things are hotting up here properly i sprung it on uncle clarence just now that i want to marry you so did i only he wasn t there i said uncle clarence aren t you grateful to mr carmody for finding the empress and he said yes yes yes yes yes to be sure capital boy capital boy always liked him and i said i suppose you wouldn t by any chance let me marry him and he said eh what marry him yes i said marry him and he said certainly certainly certainly certainly by all means and then aunt constance had a fit and uncle gally said she was a kill joy and ought to be ashamed of herself for throwing the gaff into love s young dream and uncle clarence kept on saying certainly certainly i don t know what old parsloe thinks of it all he s sitting in his chair looking at the ceiling and drinking hock the butler left at the end of round one i m going back to see how it s all coming out hold the line a man for whom happiness and misery are swaying in the scales three miles away and whose only medium of learning the result of the contest is a telephone wire is not likely to ring off impatiently hugo sat tense and breathless like one listening in on the radio to a championship fight in which he has a financial interest it was only when a cheery voice spoke at his elbow that he realized that his solitude had been invaded and by percy pilbeam at that percy pilbeam was looking rosy and replete he swayed slightly and his smile was rather wider and more pebble beached than a total abstainer s would have been hullo carmody said percy pilbeam what ho carmody so here you are carmody it came to hugo that he had something to say to this man here you he cried yes carmody do you want to be battered to a pulp no carmody then listen you didn t see me put that pig in the caravan understand but i did carmody you didn t not if you want to go on living percy pilbeam appeared to be in a mood not only of keen intelligence but of the utmost reasonableness and amiability say no more carmody he said agreeably i take your point you want me not to tell anybody i saw you put that caravan in the pig quite carmody quite well bear it in mind i will carmody oh yes carmody i will i m going for a stroll outside carmody care to join me go to hell quite said percy pilbeam he tacked unsteadily to the door aimed himself at it and passed through and a moment later millicent s voice spoke hugo hullo oh hugo darling the battle s over we ve won uncle clarence has said certainly sixty five times and he s just told aunt constance that if she thinks she can bully him she s very much mistaken it s a walk over they re all coming back right away in the car uncle clarence is an angel so are you me yes you not such an angel as you are much more of an angel than i am said hugo in the voice of one trained to the appraising and classifying of angels well anyway you precious old thing i m going to give them the slip and walk home along the road get out ronnie s two seater and come and pick me up and we ll go for a drive together miles and miles through the country it s the most perfect evening you bet it is said hugo fervently what i call something like an evening give me two minutes to get the car out and five to make the trip and i ll be with you at a boy said millicent at a baby said hugo chapter xvi sue stood staring wide eyed this was the moment that she had tried to picture to herself a hundred times and always her imagination had proved unequal to the task sometimes she had seen ronnie in her mind s eye cold aloof hostile sometimes gasping and tottering dumb with amazement sometimes pointing a finger at her like a character in a melodrama and denouncing her as an impostor the one thing for which she had not been prepared was what happened now eton and cambridge train their sons well once they have grasped the fundamental fact of life that all exhibitions of emotion are bad form bombshells can not disturb their poise and earthquakes are lucky if they get so much as an eh what from them but cambridge has its limitations and so has eton and remorse had goaded ronnie fish to a point where their iron discipline had ceased to operate he was stirred to his depths and his scarlet face his rumpled hair his starting eyes and his twitching fingers all proclaimed the fact ronnie cried sue it was all she had time to say the thought of what she had done for his sake the thought that for love of him she had come to blandings castle under false colours an impostor faced at every turn by the risk of detection liable at any moment to be ignominiously exposed and looked at through a lorgnette by his aunt constance the thought of the shameful way he had treated her all these thoughts were racking ronald fish with a searing anguish they had brought the hot blood of the fishes to the boil and now face to face with her he did not hesitate he sprang forward clasped her in his arms hugged her to him to baxter s revolted ears though he tried not to listen there came in a husky cataract the sound of a fish s self reproaches ronnie was saying what he thought of himself and his opinion appeared not to be high he said he was a beast a brute a swine a cad a hound and a worm if he had been speaking of percy pilbeam he could scarcely have been less complimentary even up to this point baxter had not liked the dialogue it now became perfectly nauseating sue said it had all been her fault ronnie said no his no hers said sue no his said ronnie no hers said sue no altogether his said ronnie it must have been his he pointed out because as he had observed before he was a hound and a worm he now went further he revealed himself as a blister a tick and a perishing outsider you re not i am you re not i am of course you re not i certainly am well i love you anyway you can t i do you can t i do baxter writhed in silent anguish how long said baxter to his immortal soul how long the question was answered with a startling promptitude from the neighbourhood of the french windows there sounded a discreet cough the debaters sprang apart two minds with but a single thought your manuscript miss said beach sedately sue looked at him ronnie looked at him sue until this moment had forgotten his existence ronnie had supposed him downstairs busy about his butlerine duties neither seemed very glad to see him ronnie was the first to speak oh hullo beach there being no answer to this except hullo sir which is a thing that butlers do not say beach contented himself with a benignant smile it had the unfortunate effect of making ronnie think that the man was laughing at him and the fishes were men at whom butlers may not lightly laugh he was about to utter a heated speech indicating this when the injudiciousness of such a course presented itself to his mind beach must be placated he forced his voice to a note of geniality so there you are beach yes sir i suppose all this must seem tolerably rummy to you no sir no i had already been informed mr ronald of the nature of your feelings toward this lady what yes sir who told you mr pilbeam sir ronnie uttered a gasp then he became calmer he had suddenly remembered that this man was his ally his accomplice linked to him not only by a friendship dating back to his boyhood but by the even stronger bond of a mutual crime between them there need be no reserves delicate though the situation was he now felt equal to it beach he said how much do you know all sir all yes sir such as beach coughed i am aware that this lady is a miss sue brown and according to my informant she is employed in the chorus of the regal theatre quite the encyclop dia aren t you yes sir i want to marry miss brown beach i can readily appreciate such a desire on your part mr ronald said the butler with a paternal smile sue caught at the smile ronnie he s all right i believe he s a friend of course he s a friend old beach one of my earliest and stoutest pals i mean he isn t going to give us away me miss said beach shocked certainly not splendid fellow beach thank you sir beach said ronnie the time has come to act no more delay i ve got to make myself solid with uncle clarence at once directly he gets back to night i shall go to him and tell him that empress of blandings is in the gamekeeper s cottage in the west wood and then while he s still weak i shall spring on him the announcement of my engagement unfortunately mr ronald the animal is no longer in the cottage you ve moved it not i sir mr carmody by a most regrettable chance mr carmody found me feeding it this afternoon he took it away and deposited it in some place of which i am not cognizant sir but good heavens he ll dish the whole scheme where is he you wish me to find him sir of course i wish you to find him go at once and ask him where that pig is tell him it s vital very good sir sue had listened with bewilderment to this talk of pigs i don t understand ronnie ronnie was pacing the room in agitation once he came so close to where baxter lay in his snug harbour that the ex secretary had a flashing glimpse of a sock with a lavender clock it was the first object of beauty that he had seen for a long time and he should have appreciated it more than he did i can t explain now said ronnie it s too long but i can tell you this if we don t get that pig back we re in the soup ronnie ronnie had ceased to pace the room he was standing in a listening attitude what s that he sprang quickly to the balcony looked over the parapet and came softly back sue what it s that blighter pilbeam said ronnie in a guarded undertone he s climbing up the waterspout chapter xvii from the moment when it left the door of matchingham hall and started on its journey back to blandings castle a silence as of the tomb had reigned in the antelope car which was bringing lord emsworth his sister lady constance keeble and his brother the hon galahad threepwood home from their interrupted dinner party not so much as a syllable proceeded from one of them in the light of what millicent an eyewitness at the front had told hugo over the telephone of the family battle which had been raging at sir gregory parsloe s table this will appear strange if ever three people with plenty to say to one another were assembled together in a small space these three one would have thought were those three lady constance alone might have been expected to provide enough conversation to keep the historian busy for hours the explanation like all explanations is simple it is supplied by that one word antelope owing to the fact that some trifling internal ailment had removed from the active list the hispano suiza in which blandings castle usually went out to dinner voules the chauffeur had had to fall back upon this secondary and inferior car and anybody who has ever owned an antelope is aware that there is no glass partition inside it shutting off the driver from the cash customers he is right there in their midst ready and eager to hear everything that is said and to hand it on in due course to the servants hall in these circumstances though the choice seemed one between speech and spontaneous combustion the little company kept their thoughts to themselves they suffered but they did it it would be difficult to find a better illustration of all that is implied in the fine old phrase noblesse oblige at lady constance we point with particular pride she was a woman and silence weighed hardest on her there were times during the drive when even the sight of voules s large red ears all pricked up to learn the reason for this sudden and sensational return was scarcely sufficient to restrain lady constance keeble from telling her brother clarence just what she thought of him from boyhood up he had not once come near to being her ideal man but never had he sunk so low in her estimation as at the moment when she heard him giving his consent to the union of her niece millicent with a young man who besides being penniless had always afflicted her with a nervous complaint for which she could find no name but which is known to scientists as the heeby jeebies nor had he re stablished himself in any way by his outspoken remarks on the subject of the efficient baxter he had said things about baxter which no admirer of that energetic man could forgive the adjectives mad crazy insane gibbering and worse potty had played in and out of his conversation like flashes of lightning and from the look in his eye she gathered that he was still saying them all over again to himself her surmise was correct to lord emsworth the events of this day had come as a stunning revelation on the strength of that flower pot incident two years ago he had always looked on baxter as mentally unbalanced but being a fair minded man he had recognized the possibility that a quiet regular life and freedom from worries might in the interval which had elapsed since his late secretary s departure from the castle have effected a cure certainly the man had appeared quite normal on the day of his arrival and now into the space of a few hours he had crammed enough variegated lunacy to equip all the march hares in england and leave some over for the mad hatters the ninth earl of emsworth was not a man who was easily disturbed his was a calm which as a rule only his younger son frederick could shatter but it was not proof against the sort of thing that had been going on to day no matter how placid you may be if you find yourself in close juxtaposition with a man who when he is not hurling himself out of windows is stealing pigs and trying to make you believe they were stolen by your butler you begin to think a bit lord emsworth was thoroughly upset as the car bowled up the drive he was saying to himself that nothing could surprise him now and yet something did as the car turned the corner by the rhododendrons and wheeled into the broad strip of gravel that faced the front door he beheld a sight which brought the first sound he had uttered since the journey began bursting from his lips good god the words were spoken in a high penetrating tenor and they made lady constance jump as if they had been pins running into her this unexpected breaking of the great silence was agony to her taut nerves what is the matter matter look look at that fellow voules took it upon himself to explain never having met lady constance socially as it were he ought perhaps not to have spoken he considered however that the importance of the occasion justified the solecism a man is climbing the waterspout m lady what where i don t see him he has just got into the balcony outside one of the bedrooms said the hon galahad lord emsworth went straight to the heart of the matter it s that fellow baxter he exclaimed the summer day for all the artificial aid lent by daylight saving was now definitely over and gathering night had spread its mantle of dusk over the world the visibility therefore was not good and the figure which had just vanished over the parapet of the balcony of the garden room had been unrecognizable except to the eye of intuition this however was precisely the sort of eye that lord emsworth possessed he reasoned closely there were he knew on the premises of blandings castle other male adults besides rupert baxter but none of these would climb up waterspouts and disappear over balconies to baxter on the other hand such a pursuit would seem the normal ordinary way of passing an evening it would be his idea of wholesome relaxation soon no doubt he would come out onto the balcony again and throw himself to the ground that was the sort of fellow baxter was a man of strange pleasures and so going as we say straight to the heart of the matter lord emsworth jerking the pince nez off his face in his emotion exclaimed it s that fellow baxter not since a certain day in their mutual nursery many years ago had lady constance gone to the length of actually hauling off and smiting her elder brother on the head with the flat of an outraged hand but she came very near to doing it now perhaps it was the presence of voules that caused her to confine herself to words clarence you re an idiot even voules could not prevent her saying that after all she was revealing no secrets the chauffeur had been in service at the castle quite long enough to have formed the same impression for himself lord emsworth did not argue the point the car had drawn up now outside the front door the front door was open as always of a summer evening and the ninth earl accompanied by his brother galahad hurried up the steps and entered the hall and as they did so there came to their ears the sound of running feet the next moment the flying figure of percy pilbeam came into view taking the stairs four at a time god bless my soul said lord emsworth if pilbeam heard the words or saw the speaker he gave no sign of having done so he was plainly in a hurry he shot through the hall and more like a startled gazelle than a private inquiry agent vanished down the steps his shirt front was dark with dirt stains his collar had burst from its stud and it seemed to lord emsworth in the brief moment during which he was able to focus him that he had a black eye the next instant there descended the stairs and flitted past with equal speed the form of ronnie fish lord emsworth got an entirely wrong conception of the affair he had no means of knowing what had taken place in the garden room when pilbeam inspired by alcohol and flushed with the thought that now was the time to get into that apartment and possess himself of the manuscript of the hon galahad s reminiscences had climbed the waterspout to put the plan into operation he knew nothing of the detective s sharp dismay at finding himself unexpectedly confronted with the menacing form of ronnie fish he was ignorant of the lively and promising mix up which had been concluded by pilbeam s tempestuous dash for life all he saw was two men fleeing madly for the open spaces and he placed the obvious interpretation upon this phenomenon baxter he assumed had run amok and had done it with such uncompromising thoroughness that strong men ran panic stricken before him mild enough the ninth earl was by nature a lover of rural peace and the quiet life he had like all britain s aristocracy the right stuff in him it so chanced that during the years when he had held his commission in the shropshire yeomanry the motherland had not called to him to save her but had that call been made clarence ninth earl of emsworth would have answered it with as prompt a bless my soul of course certainly as any of his crusader ancestors and in his sixtieth year the ancient fire still lingered the hon galahad who had returned to watch the procession through the front door with a surprised monocle turned back and found that he was alone lord emsworth had disappeared he now beheld him coming back again on his amiable face was a look of determination in his hand was a gun eh what said the hon galahad blinking the head of the family did not reply he was moving toward the stairs in just that same silent purposeful way had an emsworth advanced on the foe at agincourt a sound as of disturbed hens made the hon galahad turn again galahad what is all this what is happening the hon galahad placed his sister in possession of the facts as known to himself clarence has just gone upstairs with a gun with a gun yes looked like mine too i hope he takes care of it he perceived that lady constance had also been seized with the urge to climb she was making excellent time up the broad staircase so nimbly did she move that she was on the second landing before he came up with her and as they stood there a voice made itself heard from a room down the corridor baxter come out come out baxter my dear fellow immediately in the race for the room from which the words had appeared to proceed lady constance getting off to a good start beat her brother by a matter of two lengths she was thus the first to see a sight unusual even at blandings castle though strange things had happened there from time to time her young guest miss schoonmaker was standing by the window looking excited and alarmed her brother clarence pointing a gun expertly from the hip was staring fixedly at the bed and from under the bed a little like a tortoise protruding from its shell there was coming into view the spectacled head of the efficient baxter chapter xviii a man who has been lying under a bed for a matter of some thirty minutes and while there has been compelled to listen to the sort of dialogue which accompanies a lovers reconciliation seldom appears at his best or feels his brightest there was fluff in baxter s hair dust on his clothes and on baxter s face a scowl of concentrated hatred of all humanity lord emsworth prepared for something pretty wild looking found his expectations exceeded he tightened his grasp on the gun and to insure a more accurate aim raised the butt of it to his shoulder closing one eye and allowing the other to gleam along the barrel i have you covered my dear fellow he said mildly rupert baxter had not yet begun to stick straws in his hair but he seemed on the verge of that final piece of self expression don t point that damned thing at me i shall point it at you replied lord emsworth with spirit he was not a man to be dictated to in his own house and at the slightest sign of violence clarence it was lady constance who spoke put that gun down certainly not clarence oh all right and now mr baxter said lady constance proceeding to dominate the scene in her masterly way i am sure you can explain her agitation had passed it was not in this strong woman to remain agitated long she had been badly shaken but her faith in her idol still held good remarkable as his behaviour might appear she was sure that he could account for it in a perfectly satisfactory manner baxter did not speak his silence gave lord emsworth the opportunity of advancing his own views explain he spoke petulantly for he resented the way in which his sister had thrust him from the centre of the stage what on earth is there to explain the thing s obvious can t say i ve quite got to the bottom of it murmured the hon galahad fellow under bed why why under bed why here at all lord emsworth hesitated he was a kind hearted man and he felt that what he had to say would be better said in baxter s absence however there seemed no way out of it so he proceeded my dear galahad think eh that flower pot affair you remember oh understanding shone in the hon galahad s monocle you mean exactly yes yes of course subject to these attacks you mean precisely this was not the first time lady constance keeble had had the opportunity of hearing a theory ventilated by her brothers which she found detestable she flushed brightly clarence my dear kindly stop talking in that offensive way god bless my soul lord emsworth was stung i like that what have i said that is offensive you know perfectly well if you mean that i was reminding galahad in the most delicate way that poor baxter here is not quite clarence all very well to say clarence like that you know yourself he isn t right in the head didn t he throw flower pots at me didn t he leap out of a window this very afternoon didn t he try to make me think that beach baxter interrupted there were certain matters on which he considered silence best but this was one on which he could speak freely lord emsworth eh it has now come to my knowledge that beach was not the prime mover in the theft of your pig but i have ascertained that he was an accessory a what he helped said baxter grinding his teeth a little the man who committed the actual theft was your nephew ronald lord emsworth turned to his sister with a triumphant gesture like one who has been vindicated there now perhaps you ll say he s not potty it won t do baxter my dear fellow he went on waggling a reproachful gun at his late employee you really mustn t excite yourself by making up these stories bad for the blood pressure agreed the hon galahad the empress was found this evening in your caravan said lord emsworth what in your caravan where you put her when you stole her and bless my soul said lord emsworth with a start i must be going and seeing that she is put back in her sty i must find pirbright i must in my caravan baxter passed a feverish hand across his dust stained forehead illumination came to him then that s what that fellow carmody did with the animal lord emsworth had had enough of this empress of blandings was waiting for him counting the minutes to that holy reunion he chafed at having to stand here listening to these wild ravings first beach then ronald then carmody you ll be saying i stole her next or galahad here or my sister constance baxter my dear fellow we aren t blaming you please don t think that we quite see how it is you will overwork yourself and of course nature demands the penalty i wish you would go quietly to your room my dear fellow and lie down all this must be very bad for you lady constance intervened her eye was aflame and she spoke like cleopatra telling an ethiopian slave where he got off clarence will you kindly use whatever slight intelligence you may possess the theft of your pig is one of the most trivial and unimportant things that have ever happened in this world and i consider the fuss that has been made about it quite revolting but whoever stole the wretched animal lord emsworth blenched he stared as if wondering if he had heard aright and wherever it has been found it was certainly not mr baxter who stole it it is as mr baxter says much more likely to have been a young man like mr carmody there is a certain type of young man i believe to which mr carmody belongs which considers practical joking amusing do ask yourself clarence and try to answer the question as reasonably as is possible for a man of your mental calibre what earthly motive would mr baxter have for coming to blandings castle and stealing pigs it may have been the feel of the gun in his hand which awoke in lord emsworth old memories of dashing days with the shropshire yeomanry and lent him some of the hot spirit of his vanished youth the fact remains that he did not wilt beneath his sister s dominating eye he met it boldly and boldly answered back and ask yourself constance he said what earthly motive mr baxter has for anything he does yes said the hon galahad loyally what motive has our friend baxter for coming to blandings castle and scaring girls stiff by hiding under beds lady constance gulped they had found the weak spot in her defences she turned to the man who she still hoped could deal efficiently with this attack mr baxter she said as if she were calling on him for an after dinner speech but rupert baxter had had no dinner and it was perhaps this that turned the scale quite suddenly there descended on him a frenzied desire to be out of this cost what it might an hour before half an hour before even five minutes before his tongue had been tied by a still lingering hope that he might yet find his way back to blandings castle in the capacity of private secretary to the earl of emsworth now he felt that he would not accept that post were it offered to him on bended knee a sudden overpowering hatred of blandings castle and all it contained gripped the efficient baxter he marvelled that he had ever wanted to come back he held at the present moment the well paid and responsible position of secretary and adviser to j horace jevons the american millionaire a man who not only treated him with an obsequiousness and respect which were balm to his soul but also gave him such sound advice on the investment of money that already he had trebled his savings and it was this golden hearted chicagoan whom he had been thinking of deserting purely to satisfy some obscure sentiment which urged him to return to a house which he saw now he loathed as few houses have been loathed since human beings left off living in caves his eyes flashed through their lenses his mouth tightened i will explain i knew you would have an explanation cried lady constance i have a very simple one and short i hope asked lord emsworth restlessly he was aching to have done with all this talk and discussion and to be with his pig once more to think of the empress languishing in a beastly caravan was agony to him quite short said rupert baxter the only person in the room who so far had remained entirely outside this rather painful scene was sue she had looked on from her place by the window an innocent bystander she now found herself drawn abruptly into the maelstrom of the debate baxter s spectacles were raking her from head to foot and he had pointed at her with an accusing forefinger i came to this room he said to try to recover a letter which i had written to this lady who calls herself miss schoonmaker of course she calls herself miss schoonmaker said lord emsworth reluctantly dragging his thoughts from the empress it s her name my dear fellow that he explained gently is why she calls herself miss schoonmaker god bless my soul he said unable to restrain a sudden spurt of irritability if a girl s name is schoonmaker naturally she calls herself miss schoonmaker yes if it is but hers is not it is brown listen my dear fellow said lord emsworth soothingly you are only exciting yourself by going on like this probably doing yourself a great deal of harm now what i suggest is that you go to your room and put a cool compress on your forehead and lie down and take a good rest i will send beach up to you with some nice bread and milk rum and milk amended the hon galahad it s the only thing i knew a fellow in the year who was subject to these spells you probably remember him clarence bellamy barmy bellamy we used to call him and whenever her name is brown repeated baxter his voice soaring in a hysterical crescendo sue brown she is a chorus girl at the regal theatre in london and she is apparently engaged to be married to your nephew ronald lady constance uttered a cry lord emsworth expressed his feelings with a couple of tuts the hon galahad alone was silent he caught sue s eye and there was concern in his gaze i overheard beach saying so in this very room he said he had had the information from mr pilbeam i imagine it to be accurate but in any case i can tell you this much whoever she is she is an impostor who has come here under a false name while i was in the smoking room some time back a telegram came through on the telephone from market blandings it was signed myra schoonmaker and it had been handed in in paris this afternoon that is all i have to say concluded baxter i will now leave you and i sincerely hope i shall never set eyes on any of you again good evening his spectacles glinting coldly he strode from the room and in the doorway collided with ronnie who was entering can t you look where you re going he asked eh said ronnie clumsy idiot said the efficient baxter and was gone in the room he had left lady constance keeble had become a stone figure of menace she was not at ordinary times a particularly tall woman but she seemed now to tower like something vast and awful and sue quailed before her ronnie cried sue weakly it was the cry of the female in distress calling to her mate just so in prehistoric days must sue s cave woman ancestress have cried to the man behind the club when suddenly cornered by the sabre toothed tiger which lady constance keeble so closely resembled ronnie what s all this asked the last of the fishes he was breathing rather quickly for the going had been fast pilbeam once out in the open had shown astonishing form at the short sprint he had shaken off ronnie s challenge twenty yards down the drive and plunged into a convenient shrubbery and ronnie giving up the pursuit had come back to sue s room to report it occasioned him some surprise to find that in his absence it had become the scene of some sort of public meeting what s all this he said addressing that meeting lady constance wheeled round upon him ronald who is this girl eh ronnie was conscious of a certain uneasiness but he did his best he did not like his aunt s looks but then he never had something was evidently up but it might be that airy nonchalance would save the day you know her don t you miss schoonmaker met her with me in london is her name brown and is she a chorus girl why yes admitted ronnie it was a bombshell but eton and cambridge stood it well why yes he said as a matter of fact that s right words seemed to fail lady constance judging from the expression on her face this was just as well i d been meaning to tell you about that said ronnie we re engaged lady constance recovered herself sufficiently to find one word clarence eh said lord emsworth his thoughts had been wandering you heard heard what beyond the stage of turbulent emotion lady constance had become suddenly calm and icy if you have not been sufficiently interested to listen she said i may inform you that ronald has just announced his intention of marrying a chorus girl oh ah said lord emsworth would a man of baxter s outstanding unbalanced intellect he was wondering have remembered to feed the empress regularly the thought was like a spear quivering in his heart he edged in agitation toward the door and had reached it when he perceived that his sister had not yet finished talking to him so that is all the comment you have to make is it eh what about the point i have been endeavouring to make you understand went on lady constance with laborious politeness is that your nephew ronald has announced his intention of marrying into the regal theatre chorus who ronald this is ronald he is anxious to marry miss brown a chorus girl this is miss brown how do you do said lord emsworth he might be vague but he had the manners of the old school ronnie interposed the time had come to play the ace of trumps she isn t an ordinary chorus girl from the fact of her coming to blandings castle under a false name said lady constance i imagine not it shows unusual enterprise what i mean continued ronnie is i know what a bally snob you are aunt constance no offence but you know what i mean keen on birth and family and all that sort of rot well what i m driving at is that sue s father was in the guards a private or a corporal captain a fellow named cotterleigh said sue in a small voice cotterleigh said ronnie cotterleigh it was the hon galahad who had spoken he was staring at sue open mouthed cotterleigh not jack cotterleigh i don t know whether it was jack cotterleigh said ronnie the point i m making is that it was cotterleigh and that he was in the irish guards the hon galahad was still staring at sue my dear he cried and there was an odd sharpness in his voice was your mother dolly henderson who used to be a serio at the old oxford and the tivoli not for the first time ronald fish was conscious of a feeling that his uncle galahad ought to be in some kind of a home he would drag in dolly henderson he would stress the dolly henderson note at just this point in the proceedings he would spoil the whole thing by calling attention to the dolly henderson aspect of the matter just when it was vital to stick to the cotterleigh the whole cotterleigh and nothing but the cotterleigh ronnie sighed wearily padded cells he felt had been invented specially for the uncle galahads of this world and the uncle galahads he considered ought never to be permitted to roam about outside them yes said sue she was the hon galahad was advancing on her with outstretched hands he looked like some father in melodrama welcoming the prodigal daughter well i m dashed he said he repeated three times that he was in this condition he seized sue s limp paws and squeezed them fondly i ve been trying to think all this while who it was that you reminded me of my dear girl do you know that in the years and i was madly in love with your mother myself do you know that if my infernal family hadn t shipped me off to south africa i would certainly have married her fact i assure you but they got behind me and shoved me onto the boat and when i came back i found that young cotterleigh had cut me out well it was a scene that some people would have considered touching lady constance keeble was not one of them never mind about that now galahad she said the point is the point is retorted the hon galahad warmly that that young fish there wants to marry dolly henderson s daughter and i m for it and i hope clarence that you ll have some sense for once in your life and back them up like a sportsman eh said the ninth earl his thoughts had once more been wandering even assuming that baxter had fed the empress would he have given her the right sort of food and enough of it you see for yourself what a splendid girl she is who this girl charming agreed lord emsworth courteously and returned to his meditations clarence cried lady constance jerking him out of them eh you are not to consent to this marriage who says so i say so and think what julia will say she could not have advanced a more impressive argument in this chronicle the lady julia fish relict of the late major general sir miles fish c b o of the brigade of guards has made no appearance we therefore know nothing of her compelling eye her dominant chin her determined mouth and her voice which at certain times as for example when rebuking a brother could raise blisters on a sensitive skin lord emsworth was aware of all these things he had had experience of them from boyhood his idea of happiness was to be where lady julia fish was not and the thought of her coming down to blandings castle and tackling him in his library about this business froze him to the marrow it had been his amiable intention until this moment to do whatever the majority of those present wanted him to do but now he hesitated you think julia wouldn t like it of course julia would not like it julia s an ass said the hon galahad lord emsworth considered this statement and was inclined to agree with it but it did not alter the main point you think she would make herself unpleasant about it i do in that case lord emsworth paused then a strange soft light came into his eyes well see you all later he said i m going down to look at my pig his departure was so abrupt that it took lady constance momentarily by surprise and he was out of the room and well down the corridor before she could recover herself sufficiently to act then she too hurried out they could hear her voice diminishing down the stairs it was calling clarence the hon galahad turned to sue his manner was brisk yet soothing a shame to inflict these fine old english family rows on a visitor he said patting her shoulder as one who if things had broken right and there had not been a regular service of boats to south africa in the nineties might have been her father what you need my dear is a little rest and quiet come along ronald we ll leave you the place to continue this discussion is somewhere outside this room cheer up my dear everything may come out all right yet sue shook her head it s no good she said hopelessly don t you be too sure said the hon galahad i ll jolly well tell you one thing said ronnie i m going to marry you whatever happens and that s that good heavens i can work can t i what at asked the hon galahad what at why er why at anything the market value of any member of this family said the hon galahad who harboured no illusions about his nearest and dearest is about threepence ha penny per annum no what we ve got to do is get round old clarence somehow and that means talk and argument which had better take place elsewhere come along my boy you never know your luck i ve seen stickier things than this come out right in my time chapter xix sue stood on the balcony looking out into the night velvet darkness shrouded the world and from the heart of it came the murmur of rustling trees and the clean sweet smell of earth and flowers a little breeze had sprung up stirring the ivy at her side somewhere in it a bird was chirping drowsily and in the distance sounded the tinkle of running water she sighed it was a night made for happiness and she was quite sure now that happiness was not for her a footstep sounded behind her and she turned eagerly ronnie it was the voice of the hon galahad threepwood that answered only me i m afraid my dear may i come onto your balcony god bless my soul as clarence would say what a wonderful night yes said sue doubtfully you don t think so oh yes i bet you don t i know i didn t that night when my old father put his foot down and told me i was leaving for south africa on the next boat just such a night as this it was i remember he rested his arms on the parapet i never saw your mother after she was married he said no no she left the stage and oh well i was rather busy at the time lot of heavy drinking to do and so forth and somehow we never met the next thing i heard two or three years ago was that she was dead you re very like her my dear can t think why i didn t spot the resemblance right away he became silent sue did not speak she slid her hand under his arm it was all that there seemed to do a corncrake began to call monotonously in the darkness that means rain said the hon galahad or not i forget which did you ever hear your mother sing that song no you wouldn t before your time about young ronald he said abruptly what about him fond of him yes i mean really fond yes how fond she leaned out over the parapet at the foot of the wall beneath her percy pilbeam who had been peering out of a bush popped his head back again for the detective possibly remembering with his subconscious mind stories heard in childhood of bruce and the spider had refused to admit defeat and returned by devious ways to the scene of his disaster five hundred pounds is a lot of money and percy pilbeam was not going to be deterred from attempting to earn it by the fact that at his last essay he had only just succeeded in escaping with his life the influence of his potations had worn off to some extent and he was his calm keen self again it was his intention to lurk in these bushes till the small hours if need be and then to attack the waterspout again and so to the garden room where the manuscript of the hon galahad s reminiscences lay you can not be a good detective if you are easily discouraged i can t put it into words said sue try no everything you say straight out about the way you feel about anybody always sounds silly besides to you ronnie isn t the sort of man you could understand anyone raving about you look on him just as something quite ordinary if that said the hon galahad critically yes if that whereas to me he s something rather special in fact if you really want to know how i feel about ronnie he s the whole world to me there i told you it would sound silly it s like something out of a song isn t it i ve worked in the chorus of that sort of song a hundred times two steps left two steps right kick smile both hands on heart because he s all the wo orld to me ee you can laugh if you like there was a momentary pause i m not laughing said the hon galahad my dear i only wanted to find out if you really cared for that young fish i wish you wouldn t call him that young fish i m sorry my dear it seems to describe him so neatly well i just wanted to be quite sure you really were fond of him because well well because i ve just fixed it all up she clutched at the parapet what oh yes said the hon galahad it s all settled i don t say that you can actually count on an aunt in law s embrace from my sister constance in fact if i were you i wouldn t risk it she might bite you but apart from that everything s all right the wedding bells will ring out your young man s in the garden somewhere you had better go and find him and tell him the news he ll be interested but but sue was clutching his arm a wild impulse was upon her to shout and sob she had no doubts now as to the beauty of the night but how why what has happened well you ll admit i might have married your mother yes which makes me a sort of honorary father to you yes in which capacity my dear your interests are mine more than mine in fact so what i did was to make your happiness the price of the papers ever see that play no before your time it ran at the adelphi before you were born there was a scene where what do you mean the hon galahad hesitated a moment well the fact of the matter is my dear knowing how strongly my sister constance has always felt on the subject of those reminiscences of mine i went to her and put it to her squarely clarence i said to her is not the sort of man to make any objection to anyone marrying anybody so long as he isn t expected to attend the wedding you re the real obstacle i said you and julia and if you come round you can talk julia over in five minutes you know how she relies on your judgment and then i said that if she gave up acting like a barbed wire entanglement in the path of true love i would undertake not to publish the reminiscences sue clung to his arm she could find no words percy pilbeam who for the night was very still had heard all could have found many nothing but the delicate nature of his present situation kept him from uttering them and that only just to percy pilbeam it was as if he had seen five hundred pounds flutter from his grasp like a vanishing blue bird he raged dumbly in all london and the home counties there were few men who liked five hundred pounds better than p frobisher pilbeam oh said sue nothing more her feelings were too deep she hugged his arm oh she said and again oh she found herself crying and was not ashamed now come said the hon galahad protestingly nothing so very extraordinary in that was there nothing so exceedingly remarkable in one pal helping another i don t know what to say then don t say it said the hon galahad much relieved why bless you i don t care whether the damned things are published or not at least no certainly i don t only cause a lot of unpleasantness besides i ll leave the dashed book to the nation and have it published in a hundred years and become the pepys of the future what best thing that could have happened homage of posterity and all that oh said sue the hon galahad chuckled it is a shame though that the world will have to wait a hundred years before it hears the story of young gregory parsloe and the prawns did you get to that when you were reading the thing this evening i m afraid i didn t read very much said sue i was thinking of ronnie rather a lot oh well i can tell you you needn t wait a hundred years it was at ascot the year martingale won the gold cup down below percy pilbeam rose from his bush he did not care now if he were seen he was still a guest at this hole of a castle and if a guest can not pop in and out of bushes if he likes where does british hospitality come in it was his intention to shake the dust of blandings off his feet to pass the night at the emsworth arms and on the morrow to return to london where he was appreciated well my dear it was like this young parsloe percy pilbeam did not linger the story of the prawns meant nothing to him he turned away and the summer night swallowed him somewhere in the darkness an owl hooted it seemed to pilbeam that there was derision in the sound he frowned his teeth came together with a little click if he could have found it he would have had a word with that owl the end end of the project gutenberg ebook fish preferred updated editions will replace the previous one the old editions will be renamed creating the works from print editions
