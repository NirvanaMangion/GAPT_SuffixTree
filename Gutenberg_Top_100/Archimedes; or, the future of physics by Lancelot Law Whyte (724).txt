chapter i

 the sciences converge 


one of the most fascinating features in the history of thought is that
on several occasions an important new idea has come simultaneously to
independent minds  thus after euclid s geometry had remained without
a rival for two thousand years the conception of an alternative
non euclidean system was reached separately by gauss  lobatschewsky 
and bolyai during the years          bolyai s father  while ignorant of
the fact that gauss had already made the same discoveries  wrote to his
son urging him to publish his results and used the following prophetic
words 

  there is some truth in this  that many things have an epoch  in which
 they are found at the same time in several places  just as the violets
 appear on every side in the spring  

another example of the simultaneous emergence of an idea in the minds
of different thinkers is given by darwin in his introduction to the
 origin of species   he there calls attention to the fact that in
       the broad idea of the evolution of species  though not its
cause  was simultaneously formulated by goethe in germany  st hilaire
in france  and his own grandfather  dr darwin  in england  moreover
darwin himself had the remarkable experience of finding in an essay
submitted to him in      by a  r  wallace a complete summary of his
own unpublished theory of natural selection as the chief cause of the
evolution of species 

the last few years constitute another critical period of a similar
kind  since an idea  which when made precise will transform scientific
thought  has already come independently to many thinkers  since     
many scientists have felt that in studying the emission and absorption
of light physics has come near to the problem of life     others have
proposed that in order to straighten out its atomic problems physics
will have to take a hint from biology  but what this hint should be
has not yet been indicated  the following pages suggest a definite
line of advance for physics  and interpret these isolated flashes of
intuition as evidence of a special feature in the present situation of
the sciences 

we stand at the eve of a new epoch  physics  biology  and psychology
are converging towards a scientific synthesis of unprecedented
importance  whose influence on thought and social custom will be so
profound that it will mark a stage in human evolution  for centuries
science has concentrated its highest genius on the study of inanimate
matter  to day the three great sciences are at last reaching the
problem of life  for their researches on matter  life  and mind are
now overlapping at one common issue  the nature of the fundamental
electrical processes which underlie radiation and chemical combination 

thus physics is at present occupied with the changes that occur when
an atom emits either light or electricity  biology is at the same
problem in studying the electrical processes which are the basis of all
organic behaviour  whether in primitive forms of protoplasm or in the
highly developed central nervous system of man  meantime psychology is
dealing with an identical process when it analyses the structure of
mind  and considers the elementary changes of consciousness which are
produced when light of a given colour falls on the retina and sends
its influence to the brain 

as the result of these convergent researches  life and consciousness
will soon be subject to the first stages of a theoretically grounded
control  compared with which the present tentative efforts of medicine
and psychology will be looked back on much as we remember the haphazard
work of the alchemists before the foundation of chemistry  but this
development of human knowledge and powers will carry with it great
responsibilities  and scientists have to prepare themselves for the new
tasks that will very soon fall to them  by indicating the main ideas
through which this broad scientific synthesis may come about  this
essay aims at showing that this possibility has to be taken seriously 
we shall first examine the situation in physics and then turn to
consider the influence which future developments of physical theory
may have on biology and psychology 

two main types of process defy interpretation within the present scheme
of physical conceptions  life itself  and the atomic processes of
radiation and the building up of stable compounds  in organic processes
on the one hand  and the energy interchanges of atoms on the other
hand  we find something happening which cannot adequately be explained
as a change in the  structure  of the system considered  by structure
is meant a spatial pattern of particles  which are supposed to be
permanent and to move about like cricket balls or planets  systems
with a structure of this kind could not display the purposive quality
of organic behaviour  and when we try to make a structural model
of the atom we find that it fails to explain why the atom radiates
energy in the abrupt packets which are called  quanta   instead of
in a continuous wave  we shall return presently to the question of
organisms  after making an endeavour to discover why the atom cannot be
described in terms of a particle structure 

in      rutherford achieved remarkable success in accounting for the
results of his own researches in radioactivity by adopting a model of
the atom as a miniature solar system  with planetary electrons rotating
rapidly around a nucleus  but in order to explain the fact that the
spectrum of the light emitted by an atom shows a characteristic series
of lines  bohr suggested that an electron inside an atom could emit
light only by making a discontinuous jump from one possible orbit to
another quite distinct orbit  this apparent discontinuity in the motion
of electrons has intrigued physicists for more than ten years  and the
following interpretations have recently been offered for this puzzling
behaviour 

    nature is made up of electrons  but neither space nor time is
 fundamentally discontinuous  the electron appears to have some freedom
 of choice  and to be able to reappear unexpectedly at forbidden places 

    nature is not discontinuous or arbitrary  but nevertheless
 something prevents us determining all the things we should like to
 know about an electron  for instance  if we try to determine exactly
 where it is  it behaves so that we cannot simultaneously measure its
 exact velocity   heisenberg   this view may perhaps be interpreted
 to mean that we have made the atom model more complex than the atom
 itself is  and that consequently we have been using more quantities
 than are necessary for describing all we can observe of its behaviour 

    nature is not made up of electrons  but of waves  the atom must be
 considered as a system of electric waves spread over its whole volume 
  electrons  are merely an inaccurate way of describing some of the
 properties of these waves  the wave picture of the atom is  however 
 to be considered only as a temporary expedient to be used until some
 better description of the atom can be invented  in which both the wave
 and the corpuscular properties of atoms will appear as aspects of some
 more profound physical property   schr dinger  

the first alternative is a mere cry of despair  since it does not
propose any line of advance  but the other two suggestions may be
combined thus 

    the view of the atom as a structure of newtonian particles is wrong
 since it gives rise to discontinuities  and provides more quantities
 than we at present need  a new formulation of atomic processes must
 be found using fewer quantities which will explain why we find wave
 properties  and why sometimes the electron does behave like a small
 billiard ball though really it is some different sort of thing 

now since the newtonian mathematics of moving particles is inadequate
for describing the changes that go on in the atom  just as it is for
describing organic processes  there must be some assumption implicit in
newton s laws which is valid neither for atom nor for organism  such
an assumption can be found very easily  though physics has never given
it much attention  it is that the elementary processes in nature are
 reversible   or would be if they could be isolated  by reversible is
here meant that the laws governing the process remain unchanged when
the direction of time is reversed  i e  when  t is substituted for  t 
if the law is changed by this substitution so that the reversed process
never occurs or is recognizably different  then the process is called
irreversible  an irreversible process can therefore be used to yield an
objective criterion of past and future  when these terms have been once
defined 

to take an example  if i am standing behind a hedge and take a
cinematograph film of a stone which suddenly rises in the air and
disappears from sight  i could not tell from an examination of the
film which way to wind it  thus if it is wound one way the stone
appears to rise  and if wound the other way to fall from the sky 
to tell which was the right way i should have to use my subjective
sense of the direction of time  i e  remember the fact that i saw the
stone low in the air before i saw it high up  this case  like every
gravitational process  is reversible  and motions of this kind have
provided the basis for modern physical conceptions 

but suppose that instead i had taken a film of a cup of tea as it was
cooling  one end of the film would show the steam above the cup and the
spoon changing in length as it changed in temperature  passing along
the film these effects would grow less marked until the successive
photos showed no variation when the temperature of the tea was nearly
that of the surrounding air  it would be obvious which way to wind
this film  without using any subjective criterion supplied from memory
of the individual process which had been photographed  this process is
irreversible  but physics has hitherto assumed that all such processes
are merely the statistical result of a chaos of molecular motions each
of them perfectly reversible 

the assumption of reversibility seems to some physicists so fundamental
that they think there could be no science without it  but that is
a mere prejudice arising from the fact that newton conceived one
particular way of giving mathematical formulation to the measurable
features of physical processes  by suggesting that all the laws of
nature might take a form similar to his law of gravitation  he made
the implicit assumption that all elementary processes were reversible 
gravitational motions are so  at any rate within the accuracy of
newton s law  and as a consequence of the confirmation of his law
and the fact that it has been taken as a model for the whole system
of modern physical conceptions  the latter are only appropriate for
reversible processes 

apparent irreversibility  such as the cooling of a cup of tea 
is attributed to statistical effects  and the second law of
thermodynamics  which asserts that temperatures tend to uniformity 
is treated as merely a statement of what is highly probable  this is
probably quite legitimate  but even where no statistical effect can
enter and the process is clearly irreversible physics usually adopts
any measure rather than assume that a fundamental elementary process
is irreversible     we cannot be surprised at this  since if physics
once admitted that any elementary process was irreversible it would
have to give up the whole system of newtonian conceptions  matter 
force  energy  action  and wave properties are all unsuitable for the
treatment of irreversible effects since they all ultimately depend on
newton s reversible law 

an entirely new set of ideas is necessary for describing processes
which necessarily proceed in one direction  so that one particular
state of the system must precede another state  it appears conceivable
that an alternative set of conceptions to replace the newtonian might
be established by demanding the irreversibility of all natural laws  as
well as the demands hitherto made by physics  i e  the permanence of
matter and the conservation of energy 

the question of the reversibility of natural processes provides the key
to a great intellectual struggle which is now in progress behind the
complexities of philosophic and scientific thought  the issue can be
formulated thus 

is there a real temporal process in nature  is the passage of
irreversible time a necessary element in any view of the structure of
nature  or  alternatively  is the subjective experience of time a
mere illusion in the mind which cannot be given objective expression 
these are not metaphysical questions that can still be neglected
by science with impunity  for just as einstein made his advance by
analysing conceptions such as simultaneity  which had been thought
to be adequately understood for the purposes of empirical science 
so the next development of physical theory will probably be made by
carrying on the analysis of time from the point at which einstein left
it  moreover  the above questions may be put into precise scientific
form by asking if the causal relations which are studied by science
are symmetrical and reversible so that we cannot obtain from them any
criterion by which to distinguish past and future  if  on the other
hand  they are asymmetrical and irreversible  the laws of nature lead
us on necessarily from what went before to what comes afterwards 




chapter ii

 a modern duel  einstein and eddington v  bergson and whitehead 


in this battle over the importance of time and process great names
stand out as representatives of the two opposed views  einstein
and bergson  with their lieutenants  eddington and whitehead  the
two leaders use very different methods  einstein  as mathematical
physicist  suggests that physical laws can best be expressed if we
assume that space and time are so similar that physics can make no
absolute distinction between them  thus in relativity theory the
symmetry of space involves the symmetry of time  and therefore the
reversibility of physical laws  as has been shown by birkhoff 
bergson  as biologist and philosopher  denies that the view of time
which is implicit in relativity mathematics is adequate when a wider
range of experience is taken into account 

einstein starts by excluding all but a very narrow range of physical
experience  and finds that he can make successful predictions about
light and gravitation by treating the irreversibility of the passage
of time as of no importance for scientific measurements  bergson  by
studying a wide range of biological and subjective experience  comes
to assert the existence of a creative process  though the inherent
limitations of the intellect and of science may leave the essence of
this process outside their reach 

both protagonists have left their flanks exposed  by omitting to
present their view as a consistent logical system  einstein because he
is concerned only with the equations that can be empirically tested 
and bergson because his chief interest is non intellectual  it is here
that their lieutenants step forward to develop the two points of view 
and hence to intensify the conflict 

eddington provides a logical basis for the theory of relativity and
reveals that the significance of physical laws is not quite what we
used to think  they are  he argues  identities which the human mind
discovers in its search for something permanent that it can call
 matter  beneath all the changing appearances of the world  we have
made matter the real thing by demanding permanence or indestructibility
as the basis of physical reality  now that we know that we have done
this it need not trouble us too much to find that absolute unchanging
matter doesn t exist  since this merely means that we started out with
a demand that nature cannot fulfil  unfortunately eddington doesn t
discuss what alternative demand we might now make in order to build
up a more satisfactory system of scientific ideas  but in spite of his
enthusiastic support of einstein s theory  with its implicit assumption
of reversibility  eddington hesitates at least once in his advocacy
of reversible laws  for facts are turning up which suggest that this
undiscussed presupposition may not prove valid    

meantime whitehead has been at work on the other side  and by
sharpening his logic till few can understand him has made the idea of
temporal process the basis of all intellectual and scientific thought 
whereas up to now process has always presented many difficult problems
for the intellect  he proposes that since the conception of matter
has been found to be unsatisfactory we must start from the basic idea
of process in building up a new physical theory  as a consequence of
his line of thought  whitehead found it necessary to reject some of
einstein s arguments and to show that einstein s law could be reached
from quite different postulates  for instance  whitehead assumed that
the motion of light was irreversible  and that light did not travel
with the same velocity in the two opposed directions 

so much for one aspect of the conflict  its logical and philosophical
basis  but the issue must be decided by appeal to experimental
confirmation over the widest range of phenomena  orthodox physics still
assumes reversibility  and has on its side the explicit statement made
by einstein in          but by doing so it excludes at the start any
reference to organic processes  conceptions based on this assumption
could never be legitimately applied to life  and all attempts made
hitherto to explain the central controlling processes of organisms in
terms of classical physics have necessarily failed  we know now that
this failure could have been foreseen 

the same objection cannot be made against the basic ideas of bergson
and whitehead  nor against the new atomic physics as interpreted by
born  as we shall see in a moment  to bergson and whitehead  as to many
others amongst whom lloyd morgan must be mentioned  the process of
nature is creative  i e  it involves the coming into being of the new 
the appearance of new combinations essentially precluded before  this
probably means that the laws of physics which are to describe what is
actually happening in the world must be given irreversible form  for
reversible equations make no distinction between to day and to morrow 
and cannot express the fact that at later moments new forms may emerge 
either in the evolution of organisms or of stars  on the other hand
irreversible laws can be arranged so as to display time as an active
factor in causation  i e  to emphasize the fact that a certain period
of time necessarily has to pass before some new combination can be
attained    

the upholders of a real process in nature can appeal to the facts of
organic life  human memory  and to biological and stellar evolution 
but their case is still weak because fundamental irreversibility
has not yet received explicit mathematical formulation suitable for
experimental test  when this has been done the intellectual battle will
be brought to its decision  and if irreversibility wins the day biology
and psychology will find themselves in possession of a physical basis
well suited to the facts with which they have to deal 

there is reason to believe that the decision will be made very soon 
we saw that the implicit assumption of reversibility underlies all
newtonian conceptions  it may therefore be that the reason why we
cannot interpret atomic behaviour in terms of particle motions is that
electrical and radiational processes are essentially irreversible 
particle motion and wave propagation  the two ideas on which all
modern theories of matter are based  are both represented by
mathematical expressions which are essentially reversible since time
enters only through the square of  dt   if the quantum processes should
prove to be irreversible  we have already found a reason why the old
conceptions of particles and waves must be inadequate 

this speculation may indeed be found correct  since born  one of
the leading experts in quantum dynamics  asserts that all quantum
processes are irreversible and that the apparent reversibility of
classical processes is only an approximation due to the fact that their
irreversibility happens to be negligible     we may therefore hope that
the atomic physicists will soon formulate the quantum laws in a clearly
irreversible form which admits of precise experimental test 

but this may take some years  and in the meantime we must look around
and see how this issue is affecting current thought  we find the doubt
about process presented by mr sullivan  in  gallio    who has not yet
made up his mind to which side science will grant the victory  thus on
one page he writes   it seems to be true that events do not really take
place  we come across them  and suggests that process may be  a totally
irrelevant idea when applied to reality   but later we learn to our
surprise that  it seems likely that  in scientific theory  the world
will have to be regarded as an evolutionary process  where patterns of
value emerge   however  this inconsistency need not bother us  since
we are told that  the teachings of science so far as the spiritual
problems of man are concerned are merely irrelevant  

these views reflect perfectly the uncertainty of the time  and will be
looked back on as a precious record of the state of mind which preceded
the scientific synthesis  perhaps the most interesting feature of
the essay is the indecision it displays with regard to the spiritual
importance of science  this is a relic from the days when there were
two worlds  the world of science and the world of religion and art  no
one ever knew which of these worlds they were living in  and this is no
wonder  for the division was made only because at one time it looked
as though the scientific method could only deal with  quantities  
and therefore that science could have nothing to say about values or
qualities  this view is no longer tenable  for instance  there is a
quality in organic integration which most of us value  and without this
and many other such conceptions biology and psychology could not get
far 

before proceeding any further it is necessary to correct a common
misunderstanding with regard to the significance of einstein s theory
of relativity  this theory is mathematical  and is based on a series
of postulates which rule out any claim to present an ultimate theory
of space and time  one of these postulates    asserts that all our
physical knowledge can be reduced to the space time coincidences
of pairs of point events  or in other words the intersection of
the world lines of electrons  no respect for the supreme genius
who predicted two experimental results and eliminated the chief
discrepancies remaining in newtonian theory should restrain scientists
from pointing out that this postulate assumes something that has never
been known to occur  and has no valuable reference to the world of
physical experiment  the confirmation of einstein s final equations
cannot give any validity to this postulate  for it is difficult to
think of any physical experience considered by theoretical physics
which does not involve the perception of light or colour  and one
cannot assume that the perception of light is a perception of
coincidences  light varies in colour and intensity  coincidence in
space is too abstract to account for an effect which is subject to
variation  moreover all physical experience requires a certain amount
of time  and this fact is neglected if perception is reduced to the
recognition of instantaneous coincidences  even if these two criticisms
are left on one side we still have to notice that einstein s postulate
rules out from the range of physics the important fact that many
processes are irreversible  for instance  if we accept einstein s
definition of physical experience  then the interesting fact that
radioactivity is only observed in the form of disintegration  and not
also as the reverse process of a spontaneous building up of heavier
elements from lighter  has to be left over by physics to be dealt with
by some other science 

it almost always happens that the formulations of genius are
exaggerated and form the basis of a pernicious orthodoxy  and it has
certainly happened to relativity theory  against a tide of exaggerated
praise whitehead  larmor  and bridgman  as well as some continental
astronomers  have debated the general assumption that the theory of
relativity is adequate to its task  but those in whose hands the power
of orthodoxy lies have not yet answered their criticisms in print 
neglect has always been the weapon by which orthodoxy has unknowingly
hindered the advance of new ideas  but while this neglect is easy to
understand  it is really remarkable that the postulates of relativity
theory were not subjected to closer examination before it was made the
basis of wide philosophical speculation  the experimental confirmation
of einstein s law of gravitation does not guarantee his postulates 
since whitehead has reached a similar law  identical within the
accuracy of the observations  from different assumptions 

einstein s profound creative intuition and use of a difficult
technique compel our deepest respect  but his work should never have
been regarded as a  general  theory of time and space  not only does
he neglect the question of irreversibility but it is very doubtful if
periodic processes can be made to fit into his scheme  as has been
pointed out by russell and bridgman during the last year  probably
einstein himself has never regarded his theory as more than a stage in
the attempt to create a still wider physical synthesis  and we must
not interpret in a broad sense his statement that one of the demands
of his theory  takes away from space and time the last remnant of
physical objectivity      this could only be true if physical time
shared the absolute symmetry of space  i e  if physical processes
were all reversible  but there are processes from which we can obtain
an objective criterion of the direction of time  and hence time does
retain an element of physical objectivity as distinct from the
absolute symmetry of space  one of the most interesting features in the
future of physics will be the explanation of the fact that einstein
reached a correct law from postulates of limited validity  and in
this connection whitehead s alternative derivation may prove to be of
importance 




chapter iii

 time in astronomy and physics 


the real discrepancy between the world of physics and that of life lies
in the fact that physics has never recognized the irreversibility of
time  while this is fundamental to life  we may even feel a doubt if
the  t  of physics has the same significance as the time of biology 
evolution  history  and human experience  the physical conception of
time arose from the practical utility of clocks for describing natural
processes  and finally took the form of defining astronomical time in
terms of the rotation of the earth  the day was in fact taken as an
absolute measure of time  and this remained quite satisfactory so long
as the laws of physics were found to take a simple form with reference
to the time so defined 

but then a complication arose  the study of the moon s motion suggested
to astronomers that the earth s rotation was slowing down  i e  to
account for the apparent motion of the moon they had to assume that
the day was increasing in length  the theory of the tides revealed
a possible cause for this slowing down in the tidal friction on the
bottom of shallow water basins  for instance the rush of the atlantic
tides into the irish sea provides an appreciable frictional force
retarding the spin of the earth  in addition to this slowing down there
appears to be a very slow periodic variation in the length of the day
such as would be accounted for by a rhythmic expansion and contraction
of the earth s crust 

the astronomers declare that our old measure of time is not only
getting slower and slower  it is even varying rhythmically  it is clear
that they have thrown over the earth as their definition of equal
time intervals and have surreptitiously substituted something else 
yet one cannot discover any formal announcement of this  or find out
if they realize that by doing this they have altered the theoretical
significance of all physical measurements  in earlier days physics
defined time in terms of a selected clock  and then set about finding
the laws of nature  but the old ways aren t good enough for the modern
astronomer who gives us our time and sets the clocks of our physical
laboratories  he has reasons for disapproving of the earth  and has
almost reversed the procedure  in order to save the laws of inertia
and gravitation in connection with the moon s motion  and to a lesser
degree in the cases of the planets and the sun  he has made these laws
his standard of equal time intervals in place of the earth s rotation 

it is a curious situation  especially in view of the fact that
einstein s law  which has superseded newton s  is not very suitable
for use as an astronomical clock  as has been pointed out by larmor 
perhaps the physicist will soon be able to use the atom as the
theoretical clock for physics  and we can go on using the corrected
rotation of the earth as our practical standard  there is a faint
chance  for instance  that if physics can invent some way of measuring
the minute time intervals along the track of an electron  then
electrons might be used as giving the fundamental measure of time  thus
if the velocity of an electron were first measured by some indirect
method the electron itself might then be used as a clock  but in the
meantime the astronomers should make a formal announcement to the royal
society of what they have been up to  it then might be found necessary
to appoint a commission to discover exactly what physics is now doing 
for by using an astronomical clock of the new type it is assuming
classical laws while researching on processes which are already
known to undermine the absolute validity of these laws  theoretical
physics cannot hope to clear up its fundamental problems until it has
considered exactly what is involved in this suspicious procedure 

like most professions  physics includes a good deal of bluff  but
unlike the others physics is now occupied on a campaign to get rid of
all pretence  for instance  physical text books have been filled for
twenty years with phrases of this kind   an electron with a velocity
of so many cms per sec   yet the professors omitted to tell their
students the awful secret that this hypothesis of electron velocities
is one that has never yet received direct experimental confirmation 
to day a reaction has set in and the demand is being made that physical
theory shall not make use of conceptions that do not correspond to
directly observed quantities  thus the latest theories of the atom have
eliminated the idea of electron orbits because it was realized that
these were nothing more than a mathematical trick for calculating
something quite different  the wave length of the light an atom can
emit  in place of the orbits it is hoped to substitute something which
only makes use of the directly observed features of the atom  but this
new picture is not complete 

yet physics still makes use of ideas that have not been adequately
justified  for though the idea of moving electrons has been removed
from the latest atomic model  no substitute for it has yet been
proposed for the case of electrons outside the atom  it therefore
becomes very important for the experimental physicist to discover
whether he can measure the distance travelled by an electron in a
measured fraction of a second  as yet we have no proof that nature
has not confused us by making electrons behave rather like moving
particles  though really they are something different  in fact we
have not yet made enough direct experiments to know even whether
the dimensional system which is used for electrons is correct  since
no electron velocity has ever been directly measured we cannot be
sure that the dimensions of the new constant  h   called planck s
constant  are really what we suppose  energy multiplied by time  until
a way has been invented of making a direct measurement of some  time 
involved in electronic motions  it is impossible for physical theory to
know how it should deal with the quantum processes 

when we realize how uncertain are the conceptions on which the whole
of electron theory is based  we may wonder what is really known about
the atom itself  yet it is possible that we know more about the atom
than we think  and that what are talked about as facts concerning
electrons and radiation may really be better viewed as information
about individual atoms and the way in which they influence one another 
the emission of light is an atomic process  and we only know about
light when it has reached some atom and been at least partially
absorbed  some un understood change of condition occurs in an atom when
it radiates and passes this changed condition on to another atom  the
absorbed energy may cause chemical change  as on a photographic plate 
but if a human mind is to become aware of this change of condition 
then sooner or later  directly or indirectly  its influence must be
passed on to an atom in the retina  we know very little about this
change of atomic condition  and though it is usually called a change of
the internal electrical energy of the atom this supposes more than we
really know until some electron velocity has been directly measured 
the dimensions of electrical energy are taken as those of kinetic
energy  i e  mass times square of velocity  but we do not yet know if
this describes atomic changes correctly  since no one has ever measured
a  time  involved in an electronic process  the scale of time in the
atom might be quite different from that given by our calculations 

our ignorance of what this change of atomic condition really signifies
is so profound that some writers have begun to treat the atom as though
it were an organism  alive when the atom is excited  and dead when in
a state of minimum energy  thus whitehead proposes that we should call
the atom an organism  though this of course may only muddle us since we
know even less about life than we do about the atom 

yet we do know one very interesting thing about this change which
happens to atoms but cannot be reduced to a change of structure  when
light reaches an atom in the retina  an electrical stimulus passes
up a nerve and alters the condition of the protoplasm somewhere in
the brain  this change in brain condition is known to us directly as
the perception of colour  therefore in one sense we know more about
this change of atomic condition than we ever did about  electric
fields  or  gravitational potential  or any other of the mathematical
conveniences used by physics in correlating observed quantities  the
change in a sodium atom when we put salt in a flame is not a change
in the consciousness of the sodium atom  because it is not part of a
complex nervous system with the same high co ordination as is found in
the human being  and therefore the atom has no consciousness  but when
an atom in the brain undergoes the same change we may become conscious
of it  and the changes in matter which occur when light is absorbed are
undoubtedly associated with the problem of consciousness 

thus we are led to ask  how are single atoms built up into complex
systems which have the characteristics of life  and finally into still
more complex systems which have human consciousness 




chapter iv

 an evolutionary experiment 


questions are often made unnecessarily difficult by their being
expressed in an abstract or theoretical form  and instead of asking
what is life  it will be more valuable to put forward a practical issue
for discussion  could an infinitely wise physicist order the necessary
chemicals to day  and to morrow put together a synthetic man  if not 
why not  what are we really up against  that seems to put some aspects
of life beyond our control 

let us watch this ambitious physicist as he enters his laboratory 
he has started quite easily and has in a moment prepared some simple
molecules from their elements  now he has completed the first colloid
that he will require  and is starting on his first organic synthesis 
but his infinite wisdom does not give him eternity within a minute 
and we notice that he is getting on more slowly  while the actual
combination of the first molecules took only about a thousandth of a
second  once he had the apparatus ready  the simplest colloid took
about a second  the organic colloid has taken him about a minute  it
seems that nature won t work faster than that  she has her own rhythm
and won t be rushed  if we wait patiently till the end of the day our
friend may have his first speck of protoplasm  and all the skill in the
world would only have helped him to make more of it  not to have got
any further in his game of evolution 

but look at him now  he is making a hasty calculation as though he had
just realized some great secret of nature  and knew that he could never
create his homunculus  we look over his shoulder and read 


  estimated minimum time required by the synthetic processes of nature
 to attain various evolutionary stages  

  starting from the                        minimum
    elements  to                             time

  simple inorganic compound                        sec 
  simple colloid                              sec 
  protein                                     hour
  primitive protoplasm                        month
  simplest uni cellular organism               years
  flagellate                                      years
  mammal  including  homo sapiens                     years

this highly speculative estimate is based on suggestive facts  a
certain amount of time is necessary for two atoms to approach one
another and form a molecule  the time required will be greater if many
atoms have to settle down together into some special arrangement  for
instance  the metal silver is normally crystalline  but if silver
vapour is condensed too quickly the atoms will not have time to
arrange themselves  and it is found that they pile up anyhow into an
amorphous mass 

colloidal processes require even longer periods  because great clumsy
molecules have to arrange themselves on the surface of the colloidal
particles  in elementary forms of protoplasm the molecular patterns
are still more complex  and yet more time must be necessary to get the
molecules properly adjusted 

it is probable that only our ignorance prevents us from building up
protoplasm  but that we shall require rapidly increasing amounts of
time for each successive stage of evolution  this will certainly be
the case when we have reached organisms which can only be rendered
more complex by controlling their environment while they reproduce
themselves for many generations  a higher organism cannot be built up
directly  the molecular arrangements in its body can only be reached
through the synthesis of some simple form of life which must then be
allowed to evolve through countless generations  organic heredity
resides in molecular patterns which can only be built up by this very
slow process of repeated reproduction  thus it is  shortage of time 
that our ambitious scientist is up against in his haste to create a
homunculus  only the synthetic alchemy of time can build up organisms 
each bearing within itself a long heredity 

the estimates given for the minimum time required in each case are
about a thousandth of the actual time taken in a laboratory experiment
or in the history of evolution as known from geological records  it may
have taken a million years or more for the first mobile cells to have
developed from inorganic materials and a thousand million years for the
mammals  yet perhaps these processes might have gone on more quickly 
the times given are mere suggestions of a minimum time which may be
necessary under ideal conditions  we waste a lot of time adjusting
the apparatus in a laboratory experiment  and in evolution there may
have been stationary periods with little or no new development  but it
seems likely that when we know more about it we shall discover that a
certain time is required for the formation of organic systems of given
complexity  in this sense we may say that then human spermatozoon and
ovum carry within them the synthesis of at least a million years 

only an international institute of evolutionary research under the
most stable of leagues of nations could hope to create an artificial
man  and even then man could hardly take the credit  for time would
have done more than man  but with sufficient consistency of purpose
man could do this  provided he learnt how to make use of every moment
of the creative power of time  and never made a slip by which the
accumulated treasure of the years  i e  heredity  might be broken  how
man would learn to value life  and how profoundly such an experiment
might alter his view of human beings  each one a priceless miracle 
fruit of a million years 

in twenty years  time scientific knowledge will be adequate for the
beginning of this giant task  and we shall be subscribing our guineas
for the foundation of the institute  time has created man  man may use
time to create man once more  with a million years ahead of us before
we reach the sensitive mammals  we need hardly fear criticism from the
society for the prevention of cruelty to animals  we are simply going
to allow life to evolve itself under ideal conditions with switzerland
as the state for evolutionary research 

it may happen that under such perfect conditions life will evolve more
swiftly than it did on this rough and ready planet  but equally well
we  or rather our descendants  may find that the darwinian struggle for
survival is essential for evolution  and then the nations would have to
debate on the morals of reproducing the  cruelty of nature  inside the
world s evolutionary zoo  perhaps a wrathful god will seek to punish
mankind for attempting to build this ladder to the secret of life  this
modern tower of babel  and amuse himself by watching the community of
scientists stricken by a plague of inconsistency amongst their weights
and measures 

the possibilities of such grand schemes have to be taken seriously  we
are now highly self conscious beings with a tremendous technique for
research  men with genuine creative imagination who reverence life must
shoulder the responsibilities of the twentieth century consciousness 
and use scientific technique for creative not life destroying purposes 
one can imagine a growing fraction of the interest now given to
war  other people s adultery  and greyhound racing  turned towards
switzerland  whence at critical moments wireless bulletins would
announce that the first amoeba had just successfully taken nourishment 
if we wish it  the future of science can be such as to recompense for
its recent occupation with gunpowder  governments would be powerless
to make war if the physicists refused to make the guns and the royal
society called upon scientists to go on strike until each war crisis
had been settled by arbitration 

the problem of life may be seen in a new light if the speculations of
the last section are accepted and we assume that a definite period
of time is necessary for the building up of any living organism  for
if this is so the laws which govern life must involve the age of the
organism since some definite moment in its history  we might choose for
this moment the instant when the parent spermatozoon entered the ovum
in the case of a higher organism  or in the evolutionary experiment
just described the age might be reckoned from the moment when the first
elementary chemicals were combined into molecules  the point is that
this whole evolutionary process must be described by laws which take
into account the age of the system under consideration 

let us take a very simple  indeed the simplest possible  example 
if two hydrogen atoms having just the correct total energy for the
formation of a hydrogen molecule have approached one another and
combined  the law describing what has happened must indicate that at
a definite moment the combination was complete and the process at an
end  this is an example of an irreversible process  since the molecule
does not  spontaneously  break up again  moreover  the mathematical
formulation of this process must include the definite age of the system
at which the process was complete  this age being measured from some
selected initial moment 

this process provides an interesting limitation to a principle put
forward by maxwell as the basis of physical science  he suggested that
the laws of physics must be considered to be eternal and unchanging and
that therefore they must be expressed in a form which does not contain
the time explicitly  this means that for physical laws there can be no
difference between to day and to morrow  the laws are concerned with
small changes which systems undergo in small time intervals  and need
not express any fundamental distinction between one moment and another 

such laws cannot express the fact that anything sudden ever occurs
which makes an essential change in the system as when two systems
become one  or when one system breaks up into two  the laws of organic
growth or the evolution of individual systems must display the fact
that at a certain age of the system special things happen  such as the
combination of two hydrogen atoms  or the attainment of maturity by an
organism  maxwell s principle puts a limitation on the form of physical
laws which precisely eliminates the laws that would be appropriate for
organisms  but there is no reason why a broader physics should not try
to frame this new type of law that would be applicable to the history
and development of individual systems  and it is probable that if this
could be done the reversible laws of newton  maxwell  and einstein
would appear as approximations which were valid when nothing of special
interest was happening  i e  when only spatial movements were involved
without synthesis  disintegration or the emission of light 

laws of the newtonian type which maxwell had in mind assume that
one can adequately describe the present state of a system without
specifying its past history  but we cannot say anything very precise
about the inside of a living organism  and it is found far more
efficient to describe what is known of its past history  we do not try
to say where atoms are in an organism  instead we mention its species 
age  etc  organisms might be defined as systems whose future behaviour
is more easily estimated from their past history than from what can be
known about their immediate internal structure  the most convenient
formulation of organic laws will therefore be expressed in terms of
the age of the organism and take account of how its life has been
spent  these laws are necessarily irreversible  since the assimilation
of oxygen or food is always going on in a manner which can never be
reversed  life is like a function which must always alter in one
direction  when this development ceases life has disappeared 

the contrast of living and dead now appears less important than the
following classification of natural processes 

    processes which are reversible and whose laws can be expressed
 independently of the age of the system  e g  gravitational and
 mechanical motions which do not involve light or heat 

    processes which are irreversible  the laws being best expressed in
 terms of the total time which has passed since some initial state 
 e g  chemical combination  growth  evolution  radioactivity  and all
 changes involving light or heat 

physics has always asserted that processes of the first type were
fundamental in nature  and astronomy provided the ideal example in
planetary motion  it was this assertion that gave rise to the essential
issue behind the conflict of mechanism and vitalism  but if born is
right  and the fundamental atomic processes are irreversible  then
the situation is completely altered  there is no longer a question
of life being an arbitrary irruption in a world of mechanical law 
since the laws of gravitation and mechanics must then be looked on as
the limiting case  when the irreversibility is vanishingly small  of
a whole series of irreversible processes which constitute the most
important examples of the fundamental order in nature  this series
would include the atomic processes connected with heat  light  and
electricity  chemical combination  colloidal effects  organic growth
and evolution  and the highly co ordinated electrical processes which
form the physiological basis of consciousness 

if this view is correct the atomic processes of radiation and chemical
combination should be just what the biologist needs to build up
organisms  instead of a chaos of little particles obeying inverse
square laws  the modern physicist offers to the biologist a new kind of
atom with electrical and magnetic properties which cause it to build
up stable compounds 

the biologist may reply   yes  but organisms have four chief
characteristics  their behaviour is irreversible  and displays
growth  memory  and purposiveness  if you tell me that your atoms
obey irreversible laws  so much the better  because my organisms
certainly do  but your crystals grow very differently from my cells and
organisms  and you can t explain away the apparent purposiveness of all
life  

to which the physicist may answer   suppose that two hydrogen atoms are
some distance apart with the total energy necessary to make a molecule 
if they begin to move towards one another under some attractive
influence which they exert we display no surprise  but they are moving
towards a final end  which is an end  even though they are of course
unconscious of it  and provided that nothing interferes they will reach
one another  form a molecule  and the process will be consummated 
the atoms move under an irresistible law of attraction towards a final
condition which is unavoidable unless outside influences prevent
it  the system of the two atoms develops necessarily towards a
consummation  and the process has in this sense a teleological quality 
though this need not mean that any god or man had consciously planned
the end for these particular hydrogen atoms 

 this quality was not present in newton s law of gravitation precisely
because it failed to say what happens at the end of any process  for
instance when a meteorite hits the earth  newtonian laws avoid the
responsibility of dealing with all the exciting events  like the
wedding of the atoms or the death of the meteorite  on the other hand
it appears probable that all irreversible laws can be interpreted as
leading either from or to some critical end condition  thus all heat
processes tend towards an approximate uniformity of temperature  and
chemical reactions also move towards a final condition 

 such systems as these display the rudiments of unconscious purpose 
one must imagine these systems made much more complex so that it takes
a long time and considerable nourishment before their unconscious
purpose is fulfilled  whether this be the instinctive reproduction of
their kind or any other biological function  

 maybe  i like the unconscious purpose which you have revealed in
irreversible physics  because i am troubled by colleagues who see
conscious mind everywhere 

 but if i grant that your view of the atom  and hence of molecules
and colloids  allows me two of the four features i find in life  i e 
irreversibility and unconscious purpose  you have still to deal with
growth and organic memory  

 yes  growth and memory are things that physics has as yet little
to say about  but we have at any rate reduced the problem of life
to smaller proportions  it is no longer the question what is
life  but  how do colloidal processes build themselves up into
continuously active  developing systems which can react to their
surroundings so that some distant condition can ultimately be attained 
this is a much less difficult question  moreover  since the problem of
radiation underlies all the chemical processes which are associated
with the maintenance of life  we may expect considerable assistance
when physics has cleared up this crucial problem  




chapter v

 physics and mind 


if a psychologist who was not a behaviourist had been listening to this
conversation he might break in 

 does the physicist seriously propose that we should try to leave mind
out of our picture of the human organism  even if we can eventually
explain the unconscious purposes of the lower organisms as ends towards
which they are driven by physical laws  yet man has the supreme
distinction of a conscious mind  he can select his aim  and if he likes
renounce it again for something else  you must therefore allow in your
picture for the emergence of mind at some point during the course of
evolution  

 wait a moment   replies the physicist   your whole outlook towards
consciousness betrays not only an anthropomorphic standpoint  but one
limited to a single stage in man s development  there is no single
condition adequately described by the word  conscious   there are in
fact a great many different states of awareness which may grade into
one another  or may form a series of distinct conditions  we do not
know much about them yet  but their variety is most striking  there
is the dim sentience as we awake from chloroform  the awareness of
the dreaming state  the passive experiencing that accompanies any
intensely rhythmic activity such as running  again  quite different
states are known in day dreaming  intellectual concentration and the
delicately balanced semi consciousness of creative thought 

 consider especially the states of awareness associated with love  or
with the supreme creative activities of the mind  free will  or the
deliberate choice of a purpose  is completely lost in a whole natured
falling in love  as it is also in the artist s need to follow some
dimly conscious intuition of a task he must attempt  at these important
occasions free will disappears before a sense of inner organic
necessity 

 these examples seem to me to make it clear that  conscious purpose  is
not in any sense the ultimate or highest criterion of human behaviour 
and that free will need not be taken necessarily to mean the power
to over ride any laws of nature  in my view  free will  is simply
the apparent characteristic of organic behaviour when no complete
integration of the personality has been achieved and the mind seems
to be able to oscillate from one purpose to another  we really have
to deal in human beings with a whole series of forms of behaviour
of increasing complexity and integration  reflex and instinctive
actions  deliberate activity  and finally the intuitive whole natured
creative functioning which leads to ends which could not have been
intellectually foreseen  to each of these must correspond a certain
type of awareness  and in my view  a brain process of a definite degree
of complexity  by analogy with our own experience of different modes
of consciousness  we may be able to infer from the structure of the
central nervous system of an organism what sort of awareness it can
experience 

 eventually we must expect to be able to give a complete scheme of all
organic behaviour in terms of the organic processes and their laws  but
none the less it will remain a great deal more convenient in some cases
to refer to what happens to human beings by using words that suggest
their conscious experience  the behaviourist denies the scientific
significance of all but the very barest elements of conscious
experience  but of course he has to start from the human perception
of light and colour  science cannot get on without ideas which obtain
their whole meaning from the qualities of conscious experience  and
hence the extreme behaviourist position merely arises from a prejudice
which prevents clear thinking  but as a campaign to put more stress on
the direct observation of what really happens to living beings in terms
of physical movements  behaviourism can only do good by bringing more
unbiassed knowledge about life 

 my own interpretation of the question may be put in this way  the
thing that is given in nature is a process in time  according to
its complexity and degree of co ordination an organic process has
different degrees of awareness  there is no one condition called human
consciousness  because the human organism can function with different
degrees of co ordination  and if we ask if an atom in absorbing light
is conscious  the question has no definite meaning  but in a few years
those who are studying the physiology of the central nervous system
will be able to indicate how many steps of synthesis and integration
occur between the simplest cell and the creative thinker  and to each
of these stages will be ascribed a mode of awareness  but below a
certain degree of organic complexity this  awareness   will cease to
be anything that can be consciously imagined by man  e g  below the
dimmest sentience one might allow an undifferentiated knowledge of mere
continuance  based in turn on the rhythmic pulsation of the elementary
cells  

 your scheme is of course still rather vague  but in its main outlines
it appears satisfactory   replies the psychologist   but tell me
outright  can mind influence matter  if i understand you rightly  you
suggest that matter certainly influences mind  

 on the contrary  i do not  you are back at the meaningless questions
on which philosophers have wasted much time  to ask if mind can
influence matter does not mean anything until you know what you mean
by mind and matter  and to a scientist that means knowing the laws
they obey  now  on the one hand  relativity and modern quantum theory
indicate that there is no matter in the old sense of particles made of
some unchanging stuff  and physical science recognizes atomic and other
 processes  as fundamental in the place of  matter   on the other hand 
you really mean by  mind  one particular form of conscious activity 
the deliberate selection of a purpose  therefore to give your question
real meaning i have to ask instead  does the conscious selection of a
purpose alter the physical processes going on in the human organism  

 but that is an absurd question  it is like asking  does a dint in the
outside of a hat  cause  an alteration in the shape of the inside of
the hat  to which the only reply is that the dint on the outside is
merely another way of describing the dint on the inside  there is no
 causing  of the one by the other any more than if you fold a bit of
paper you can say that the crease on one side causes the crease on the
other side  they are identical and the double method of description
used in the question creates a meaningless problem 

  conscious selection of a purpose  is one way of describing a
particular process  and after this process has occurred the brain
will be different from before  the old theories of the correlation or
interaction of mind and matter presupposed that they were separate
things in themselves  the important questions become quite different
when one realizes that mind and matter do not exist independently 
but that they are both somewhat inadequate ways of describing certain
 aspects  of one organic process  the spatial aspect of organic
process is called the physical organism  the temporal aspect of organic
process corresponds to the content of its consciousness  the physical
body is a group of spatial characteristics  consciousness is a system
of temporal elements  memory  anticipation  deliberate repetition 
creative longing  hope and fear are all things set in time 

 professor alexander has said  time is the mind of space   he attempts
to explain space and time by an anthropomorphic analogy  it is a very
suggestive idea  though for the searcher whose goal is the nature of
consciousness itself it is more valuable to put it the other way round 
mind is the temporal aspect of process  body the spatial aspect  but
it is very important indeed to notice that we have not yet found the
adequate terms for describing these two aspects of process  matter is
unsatisfactory for the spatial aspect  because there are no unchanging
particles  but nor is mind sufficient for the temporal aspect  because
there is a temporal aspect to the combination of hydrogen atoms and to
chemical and colloidal processes  and yet we must not speak of these
as having mind  when the new words for these two aspects are invented
they will form the foundation of the scientific synthesis which i am
expecting  

to which the psychologist may answer   well  at heart i have always
been a thorough going determinist like you  at least in dealing with
my patients  moreover i find it works  because i have always included
in my picture of the patient a life impulse of some sort  which can be
influenced by my personality  thus if the behaviour of my patient is
absolutely determined  the conditions which determine what happens to
him include some inner life tendency  and also the effects produced on
him by all the people he meets 

 but if one attempts to formulate such an absolute determinism  or
to apply it to oneself  one gets into deep waters  and i haven t the
courage to try it  it seems you must be right at bottom  but that only
a god could believe it without its upsetting his mental balance or his
sense of moral responsibility  

 there i agree   replies the physicist   as long as one does not
simultaneously revise one s whole view of life in terms of this new
organic knowledge  that is a very big task  but i should like one
day to attempt it  two things especially would attract me to such a
revision of human values  one is that people who ought to know better
still go about making moral judgments about their acquaintances  now
that we know how profound is the influence on a child of the treatment
it receives during its first five years of life  moral judgments become
rather old fashioned and only show that the person making them has
himself not yet learnt to find emotional fulfilment in healthier ways 
an analysis of human behaviour along the lines of organic determinism
might do something to show that moral condemnations  whether of
bolshevism or of the sins of one s children  are never effective unless
immediately accompanied by positive example or creative suggestion 

 but there is another more attractive reason why i should like to
attempt this transvaluation of values  if organic determinism is valid 
then the artist s aspiration to create is a natural consequence of
some organic law  creative aspiration may then be looked on as the
natural destiny of certain human beings  though they no more know
where they are going than did the two hydrogen atoms  but organic
determinism allows us to understand why it is of no importance that the
artist doesn t know what he is going to create before he does it  it
seems that in some matters our organic body is wiser than ourselves 
or rather wiser than our very immature consciousness  when we have
developed our consciousness by the discovery of the organic laws of our
own natures we may be able to make human life more beautiful  




chapter vi

 the future of the sciences 


the preceding pages have very broadly indicated the way in which
current physical researches may influence the scientific outlook on
the problems of matter  life  and mind  the view has been put forward
that we are on the eve of a profound scientific synthesis of which the
main outlines are already determined  these general suggestions will
now be made more precise in order to offer to anyone who is interested
the opportunity of testing for himself some definite prophecies
regarding the future of scientific thought  the forecast made here does
not involve any supernatural reading of the future  but is based on
tendencies already inherent in the different departments of science 
for convenience it is expressed in the form of separate assertions
concerning the future of physics  biology  and psychology 

   before      a very remarkable simplification will be made in atomic
theory  which will indicate that in quantum processes physics has
 touched bottom  and that  for the time being  we may consider that
nature is not infinitely complex within the heart of the atom  the
proof of this apparent if not absolute limit to the micro structure
of nature will take the form of the discovery of simple relationships
between the fundamental constants of atomic structure  e  m  m  c  and
h   the electronic charge and mass  the mass of the hydrogen nucleus 
the velocity of light  and planck s constant   such relations are
already known but are considered to be of no significance since they
are ruled out by the accepted theory of electrical dimensions 

yet this dimensional system is not based on direct observation 
and the importance of these relationships will soon be recognized
in consequence of experiments aimed at a direct determination of
an  electron velocity   in a curved track   electron velocity  as
calculated from deflection experiments will be found not to be the same
as the directly measurable cms  per sec   and in the case of straight
electron tracks  the measured velocity may be found to be always that
of light  though this does not mean much since the velocity of light in
one direction has never been measured 

as the result of the study of individual radiation tracks  for instance
in the reflection of electrons by crystals  and particularly of
any  time  measurements that can be made  a new system of physical
conceptions will be built up appropriate to irreversible processes 
which will be substituted for the newtonian reversible system  the
new scheme will probably be based on the conception of the atom 
with its radiating electron tracks  as a natural clock which not
only can be used to measure out equal time intervals  but also to
yield an objective criterion of past and future  in order to make
this idea  or at least one part of it  capable of empirical test the
following hypothesis is put forward  the time interval between any two
point events on any electron track is a simple function of the length
and curvature of the part of the track between the two points  this
hypothesis contradicts the current interpretation of electron theory on
a point which has never yet been subjected to experimental test 

the conceptions which will be built up on electron velocity experiments
will very quickly bring within one simple theory the facts of chemical
combination and colloidal processes  for these depend upon irreversible
effects connected with radiation and electrons  and will therefore be
amenable to treatment by the new conceptions for the very reason which
necessarily puts them beyond the scope of newtonian laws 

   as the result of the alteration in physical conceptions biology
will soon cease to draw a definite line between inanimate and
living systems  the normal characters of life will be recognized
as appearing in steps as one passes up the series atom  molecule 
colloid  protoplasm  cell  and through further stages to mammal and
man  in each class of organism a central controlling process will be
discovered and its laws formulated with some precision  in terms of
irreversible electrochemical processes  the process which in each
organism represents the co ordinating factor and is the life of the
organism considered as a unit may for instance be described in terms
of a quantity which we shall call  f    f  would be such that so long
as  f  keeps on increasing the organism is alive  while if  f  stands
still the organism dies  the rate of increase of  f  indicates the
tempo or intensity of the organism s life  in a simple case  f  might
be directly related to the intake of oxygen or food  and just as
respiration and assimilation are irreversible  so is the change in  f  
 f  must go on increasing  or else cease to represent any quantity
in nature  as soon as it ceases to increase the process to which it
corresponds cannot be identified any longer 

the most important factors which influence the life function  f   i e 
which affect the central controlling process in any organism  will be
known before about       with the result that local rebellions such as
cancer will not only be controllable  but easily prevented  harmless
methods for increasing the rate of change of  f   i e  for increasing
the   lan vital  of the organism  will be discovered  so that  for
instance  the duration of child birth will be reduced to a natural
minimum  if child birth sometimes takes very long nowadays  this is
presumably because the woman s body is tired  exhausted  or partially
poisoned by her mode of living  and by raising her vitality at the
critical moment we may expect to be able to let the process go on at
its natural speed  there must be some minimum time necessary for the
act  since a vast number of complex organic processes have to complete
themselves in a certain order  but probably this time is considerably
shorter than that during which many women in this country have to
suffer 

it is already known that the mendelian  genes  which determine heredity
are related to the rates of development of special processes in the
organism  and a control over the life tempo  or rate of increase of
 f  in any organism or group of cells within an organism  will provide
a new method of tackling the practical problem of heredity  it is
possible that hereditary tendencies to specific weakness or disease
will be overcome by accelerating or retarding the rate of development
of the human system at some special moment between conception and
maturity 

rejuvenation will soon be safe and efficient  but not as a means for
attempting immortality  it will be socially recognized as healthy and
legitimate only when undertaken to compensate for premature ageing due
to specific repressions  illness  or anxiety 

the elimination of known diseases by a genuine science of life does not
mean that other diseases will spring up perhaps worse than before  a
theoretical science of life will know the meaning of all disease  and
will not prevent one in such a way as to give rise to another  instead
of making campaigns against influenza or any other one disease  it will
determine the conditions in which no disease can survive  and thus
gradually eliminate all the organic diseases which attack the body 

but this does not mean the attainment of a hygienic utopia in which
human life necessarily fulfils itself  a balance will be made to
the disappearance of cancer and syphilis  not by the arising of
other diseases but as a result of the consequent increase in the
sensitiveness of the human brain 

the supremely difficult task of the next hundred years will be to keep
the mind of the race healthy and stable through a period of critical
sensitiveness  we are in a transition stage of violent instability  of
intense cruelty coupled with compassion  america   of blended love of
liberty and need of discipline  of emotional religions and of wars  but
we must hope that it will lead to some mode of life with greater
inherent stability 

   psychology is now occupied with the discovery that the human
response to perceptions is not additive  i e  that the effect made by a
group of sounds or colours depends on the pattern in space and time in
which they are arranged    gestalt theorie    for instance  the effect
made on a man by the individual notes of  god save the king  when
played in the wrong order is negligible  and bears no relation to his
response when he hears the tune played in a cinema  and it reminds him
of  patriotism  and the war  so far no scientific method has been found
of describing when a group of elements is to be treated as a  whole 
for the purposes of psychology  and this is where the greatest advances
may be expected 

most scientific conceptions have been based on the method of spatial
analysis  i e  the reduction  where possible  of a thing to its
smallest spatial elements  physics  biology  and psychology have all
lacked the equipment to describe what makes the atom  organism  or the
pattern function as a unit  and how we are to know if some group is
a unit or not  the analytical method is fully developed  but we lack
even the basis for a synthetic treatment  this leads some hard headed
scientists of the materialistic school who will  stand no nonsense 
to assert that there is no such thing as  synthesis   that this is a
mystical idea left over from primitive anthropomorphism  yet to any
mind that is guided not by prejudice but by a simple search for truth 
the fact of synthesis is obvious  though not yet properly formulated 

here modern physics can supply a clue  analysis is the method required
in a search for instantaneous spatial structure  the synthetic method
which we need must deal with the temporal history and behaviour of
systems  the fact that the human being reacts in the ways he does to a
tune as a whole is evidence of something in his history  that he has
heard the tune often under certain emotional surroundings  the unity
of any synthesis  whole  or organism is not an instantaneous fact
explicable in terms of structure  for we can recognize this unity only
from a continued observation over a period of time 

physics can invent one law to describe the approach of the two
hydrogen atoms to form a molecule  and in doing so treats the two
together as a unit  this suggests that the fact of organic unity is to
be defined and formulated in terms of an irreversible law which governs
the system as a whole  thus a group of atoms  cells  or any other
elements is to be called a unit when  and only when  one irreversible
law can be found which expresses the behaviour of the different
elements as contributing towards some common end  like the formation of
the molecule in the case of the hydrogen atoms 

we can now draw a practical conclusion for the future of psychology 
which is in great need of a moral principle to guide its treatment of
disintegrated human personality  on the analogy of the two atoms  a
human being is to be considered as a unity when his whole behaviour
displays continuous co ordination towards some end  but there is an
important difference in the two cases  the atoms move towards an end
which we know because it has already happened in history  whereas
man s development is creative  that is it proceeds towards an end we
cannot know exactly before it comes into being  thus the parent or
psychologist need not trouble if he cannot understand what his child or
subject is aiming towards  so long as some consistency and harmony of
functioning is apparent  the  end  can be left to nature to look after 
because such harmony  means  that the organism is tending towards some
ultimate condition 

the psychologists of the future will therefore have to follow some
principle such as this  their only legitimate aim is the maintenance
and restoration of harmonious co ordination of all the human functions 
and no concern need be paid to ultimate intellectual or spiritual
ideals  of course if the person considered is apparently tending
towards some degenerate condition  that is known to the onlooker
because it is  not  new but a repetition of what many human beings
have done before  then this tendency can be altered  at least  it can
be altered if the onlooker can use his intuition to discover signs
of repressed conflict which show that the immediate tendency is not
whole natured  but based on the repression of some more profound
aspiration or desire  then by bringing this repressed aspiration back
into consciousness the degenerate tendency may be arrested  but this
control over the lives of others can only be effectively exercised
by the intuitive discovery that their present tendencies are not
whole natured 

                                        

prophecy can never be scientific  and forecasting in the realm of
science is perhaps the most dangerous form of intellectual acrobatics 
science must be thorough  and all vague speculation is its enemy 
but there are moments when a profound revision is necessary  and
amidst the responsibilities and rich appeal of daily life no one will
undertake this task who does not believe that it offers an adequate
reward to science and to man  to day prophecy can call attention to
unjustified limitations inherent in current scientific thought  and
encourage the students of matter and of life to get together and try to
discover the single system of natural law which we must believe covers
both realms  it may even help them to find crucial experiments by which
to guide their search 

the reward is certainly great  the indifference to the destruction of
life which has marked recent years is no cause either for surprise or
for despair after an epoch of orthodox and insincere religion coupled
with an abstract science of matter  one thing only can guide humanity
to a saner and richer life  the recognition and valuation of life 
this can be assisted by science and art both revealing life in all its
significant forms  but the roots of art have been destroyed by the
domination of a science which had not recognized the significance of
life within the realm of natural law  for great art can only arise from
a profound reverence for life  whereas to the scientific mood of this
period life appeared as an arbitrary impulse in continual conflict with
the laws of matter 

physics is now studying light  the radiant influence of light nourishes
life and within human body forms the fabric of consciousness  we are
alive and conscious  but our consciousness is immature for we do not
yet know the laws that govern our own lives and thoughts  yet it is
certain that light  life  and consciousness are bound together by some
undiscovered law  this secret of nature s alchemy is still hidden from
us within our own bodies  by revealing it physics will create a new
hope for man 




notes


    whitehead   science and the modern world   eddington comes near
to the same idea in an essay in  science  religion  and reality  
      see also weyl   was ist materie         p      it has also been
expressed by others quite independently  though i do not know of other
published references 

    e g  the irreversible motion of an electron in the field of a bar
magnet is rendered formally reversible by the assumption that the
magnetic field is due to moving electrons  yet this assumption is
highly artificial since it postulates electronic movements that have
never been observed  in other cases irreversibility is eliminated by
the choice of special co ordinate systems  some physicists now hold the
view that irreversibility may be inherent in atomic as it is in organic
processes 

     internal constitution of the stars         p      compare note on
p     

it may be convenient here to summarize the processes that give at any
rate superficial evidence of their irreversibility  processes involving
heat changes  or the radiation of light  or mass  the production of
energy in a star  the motions of electrons in magnetic fields  certain
types of atom ion collision in mixed gases  processes dependent on
retarded potentials  radioactivity  organic growth and evolution 
and consciousness itself  eddington deals only with the case of the
emission and absorption of light  but suggests that the direction
of time can only be deduced from statistical processes  this is the
orthodox view  though it is very doubtful if it is valid now that the
quantum processes are receiving formulation  in this connection  see
note   

    einstein  berlin akad    sitzungsberichte         p       but
einstein s view must be revised in view of recent experimental results
 e g  harnwell   phys  rev    vol            pp      and       if these
have been correctly interpreted  see born   zeitschr f r physik   vol 
    pp         and jordan   naturw         p      

    the idea that time may be an active factor in causation has the
mathematical significance that  t   for the system in question  must
appear explicitly in the formulation of the law  and not merely as the
square of a time differential found convenient for the correlation of
a standard clock with a reversible process which is being observed 
a law whose mathematical formulation involves  t  measured from some
moment in the history of the system  gives an entirely new meaning
to  t   though one consistent with the properties of the reversible
newtonian differential  dt   such a law may claim to express the fact
of historic  irreversible  duration  a feature in nature which is
neglected by laws involving only  dt  squared
