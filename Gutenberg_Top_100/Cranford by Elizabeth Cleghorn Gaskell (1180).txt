chapter i 
our society


in the first place  cranford is in possession of the amazons  all the
holders of houses above a certain rent are women   if a married couple
come to settle in the town  somehow the gentleman disappears  he is
either fairly frightened to death by being the only man in the cranford
evening parties  or he is accounted for by being with his regiment  his
ship  or closely engaged in business all the week in the great
neighbouring commercial town of drumble  distant only twenty miles on a
railroad   in short  whatever does become of the gentlemen  they are
not at cranford   what could they do if they were there   the surgeon
has his round of thirty miles  and sleeps at cranford  but every man
cannot be a surgeon   for keeping the trim gardens full of choice
flowers without a weed to speck them  for frightening away little boys
who look wistfully at the said flowers through the railings  for rushing
out at the geese that occasionally venture in to the gardens if the
gates are left open  for deciding all questions of literature and
politics without troubling themselves with unnecessary reasons or
arguments  for obtaining clear and correct knowledge of everybody s
affairs in the parish  for keeping their neat maid servants in admirable
order  for kindness  somewhat dictatorial  to the poor  and real tender
good offices to each other whenever they are in distress  the ladies of
cranford are quite sufficient    a man   as one of them observed to me
once   is  so  in the way in the house    although the ladies of
cranford know all each other s proceedings  they are exceedingly
indifferent to each other s opinions  indeed  as each has her own
individuality  not to say eccentricity  pretty strongly developed 
nothing is so easy as verbal retaliation  but  somehow  good will
reigns among them to a considerable degree 

the cranford ladies have only an occasional little quarrel  spirited out
in a few peppery words and angry jerks of the head  just enough to
prevent the even tenor of their lives from becoming too flat   their
dress is very independent of fashion  as they observe   what does it
signify how we dress here at cranford  where everybody knows us    and
if they go from home  their reason is equally cogent   what does it
signify how we dress here  where nobody knows us    the materials of
their clothes are  in general  good and plain  and most of them are
nearly as scrupulous as miss tyler  of cleanly memory  but i will
answer for it  the last gigot  the last tight and scanty petticoat in
wear in england  was seen in cranford and seen without a smile 

             picture  a magnificent family red silk umbrella 

i can testify to a magnificent family red silk umbrella  under which a
gentle little spinster  left alone of many brothers and sisters  used to
patter to church on rainy days   have you any red silk umbrellas in
london   we had a tradition of the first that had ever been seen in
cranford  and the little boys mobbed it  and called it  a stick in
petticoats    it might have been the very red silk one i have described 
held by a strong father over a troop of little ones  the poor little
lady the survivor of all could scarcely carry it 

then there were rules and regulations for visiting and calls  and they
were announced to any young people who might be staying in the town 
with all the solemnity with which the old manx laws were read once a
year on the tinwald mount 

 our friends have sent to inquire how you are after your journey
to night  my dear   fifteen miles in a gentleman s carriage    they will
give you some rest to morrow  but the next day  i have no doubt  they
will call  so be at liberty after twelve from twelve to three are our
calling hours  

then  after they had called 

 it is the third day  i dare say your mamma has told you  my dear  never
to let more than three days elapse between receiving a call and
returning it  and also  that you are never to stay longer than a quarter
of an hour  

 but am i to look at my watch   how am i to find out when a quarter of
an hour has passed  

 you must keep thinking about the time  my dear  and not allow yourself
to forget it in conversation  

as everybody had this rule in their minds  whether they received or paid
a call  of course no absorbing subject was ever spoken about   we kept
ourselves to short sentences of small talk  and were punctual to our
time 

i imagine that a few of the gentlefolks of cranford were poor  and had
some difficulty in making both ends meet  but they were like the
spartans  and concealed their smart under a smiling face   we none of us
spoke of money  because that subject savoured of commerce and trade  and
though some might be poor  we were all aristocratic   the cranfordians
had that kindly  esprit de corps  which made them overlook all
deficiencies in success when some among them tried to conceal their
poverty   when mrs forrester  for instance  gave a party in her
baby house of a dwelling  and the little maiden disturbed the ladies on
the sofa by a request that she might get the tea tray out from
underneath  everyone took this novel proceeding as the most natural
thing in the world  and talked on about household forms and ceremonies
as if we all believed that our hostess had a regular servants  hall 
second table  with housekeeper and steward  instead of the one little
charity school maiden  whose short ruddy arms could never have been
strong enough to carry the tray upstairs  if she had not been assisted
in private by her mistress  who now sat in state  pretending not to know
what cakes were sent up  though she knew  and we knew  and she knew that
we knew  and we knew that she knew that we knew  she had been busy all
the morning making tea bread and sponge cakes 

there were one or two consequences arising from this general but
unacknowledged poverty  and this very much acknowledged gentility  which
were not amiss  and which might be introduced into many circles of
society to their great improvement   for instance  the inhabitants of
cranford kept early hours  and clattered home in their pattens  under
the guidance of a lantern bearer  about nine o clock at night  and the
whole town was abed and asleep by half past ten   moreover  it was
considered  vulgar   a tremendous word in cranford  to give anything
expensive  in the way of eatable or drinkable  at the evening
entertainments   wafer bread and butter and sponge biscuits were all
that the honourable mrs jamieson gave  and she was sister in law to the
late earl of glenmire  although she did practise such  elegant economy  

 elegant economy    how naturally one falls back into the phraseology of
cranford   there  economy was always  elegant   and money spending
always  vulgar and ostentatious   a sort of sour grapeism which made us
very peaceful and satisfied   i never shall forget the dismay felt when
a certain captain brown came to live at cranford  and openly spoke about
his being poor not in a whisper to an intimate friend  the doors and
windows being previously closed  but in the public street  in a loud
military voice  alleging his poverty as a reason for not taking a
particular house   the ladies of cranford were already rather moaning
over the invasion of their territories by a man and a gentleman   he was
a half pay captain  and had obtained some situation on a neighbouring
railroad  which had been vehemently petitioned against by the little
town  and if  in addition to his masculine gender  and his connection
with the obnoxious railroad  he was so brazen as to talk of being
poor why  then  indeed  he must be sent to coventry   death was as true
and as common as poverty  yet people never spoke about that  loud out in
the streets   it was a word not to be mentioned to ears polite   we had
tacitly agreed to ignore that any with whom we associated on terms of
visiting equality could ever be prevented by poverty from doing anything
that they wished   if we walked to or from a party  it was because the
night was  so  fine  or the air  so  refreshing  not because
sedan chairs were expensive   if we wore prints  instead of summer
silks  it was because we preferred a washing material  and so on  till
we blinded ourselves to the vulgar fact that we were  all of us  people
of very moderate means   of course  then  we did not know what to make
of a man who could speak of poverty as if it was not a disgrace   yet 
somehow  captain brown made himself respected in cranford  and was
called upon  in spite of all resolutions to the contrary   i was
surprised to hear his opinions quoted as authority at a visit which i
paid to cranford about a year after he had settled in the town   my own
friends had been among the bitterest opponents of any proposal to visit
the captain and his daughters  only twelve months before  and now he was
even admitted in the tabooed hours before twelve   true  it was to
discover the cause of a smoking chimney  before the fire was lighted 
but still captain brown walked upstairs  nothing daunted  spoke in a
voice too large for the room  and joked quite in the way of a tame man
about the house   he had been blind to all the small slights  and
omissions of trivial ceremonies  with which he had been received   he
had been friendly  though the cranford ladies had been cool  he had
answered small sarcastic compliments in good faith  and with his manly
frankness had overpowered all the shrinking which met him as a man who
was not ashamed to be poor  and  at last  his excellent masculine common
sense  and his facility in devising expedients to overcome domestic
dilemmas  had gained him an extraordinary place as authority among the
cranford ladies   he himself went on in his course  as unaware of his
popularity as he had been of the reverse  and i am sure he was startled
one day when he found his advice so highly esteemed as to make some
counsel which he had given in jest to be taken in sober  serious
earnest 

it was on this subject  an old lady had an alderney cow  which she
looked upon as a daughter   you could not pay the short quarter of an
hour call without being told of the wonderful milk or wonderful
intelligence of this animal   the whole town knew and kindly regarded
miss betsy barker s alderney  therefore great was the sympathy and
regret when  in an unguarded moment  the poor cow tumbled into a
lime pit   she moaned so loudly that she was soon heard and rescued  but
meanwhile the poor beast had lost most of her hair  and came out looking
naked  cold  and miserable  in a bare skin   everybody pitied the
animal  though a few could not restrain their smiles at her droll
appearance   miss betsy barker absolutely cried with sorrow and dismay 
and it was said she thought of trying a bath of oil   this remedy 
perhaps  was recommended by some one of the number whose advice she
asked  but the proposal  if ever it was made  was knocked on the head by
captain brown s decided  get her a flannel waistcoat and flannel
drawers  ma am  if you wish to keep her alive   but my advice is  kill
the poor creature at once  

miss betsy barker dried her eyes  and thanked the captain heartily  she
set to work  and by and by all the town turned out to see the alderney
meekly going to her pasture  clad in dark grey flannel   i have watched
her myself many a time   do you ever see cows dressed in grey flannel in
london 

                   picture  meekly going to her pasture 

captain brown had taken a small house on the outskirts of the town 
where he lived with his two daughters   he must have been upwards of
sixty at the time of the first visit i paid to cranford after i had left
it as a residence   but he had a wiry  well trained  elastic figure  a
stiff military throw back of his head  and a springing step  which made
him appear much younger than he was   his eldest daughter looked almost
as old as himself  and betrayed the fact that his real was more than his
apparent age   miss brown must have been forty  she had a sickly 
pained  careworn expression on her face  and looked as if the gaiety of
youth had long faded out of sight   even when young she must have been
plain and hard featured   miss jessie brown was ten years younger than
her sister  and twenty shades prettier   her face was round and dimpled 
 miss jenkyns once said  in a passion against captain brown  the cause
of which i will tell you presently    that she thought it was time for
miss jessie to leave off her dimples  and not always to be trying to
look like a child    it was true there was something childlike in her
face  and there will be  i think  till she dies  though she should live
to a hundred  her eyes were large blue wondering eyes  looking straight
at you  her nose was unformed and snub  and her lips were red and dewy 
she wore her hair  too  in little rows of curls  which heightened this
appearance   i do not know whether she was pretty or not  but i liked
her face  and so did everybody  and i do not think she could help her
dimples   she had something of her father s jauntiness of gait and
manner  and any female observer might detect a slight difference in the
attire of the two sisters that of miss jessie being about two pounds per
annum more expensive than miss brown s   two pounds was a large sum in
captain brown s annual disbursements 

such was the impression made upon me by the brown family when i first
saw them all together in cranford church   the captain i had met
before on the occasion of the smoky chimney  which he had cured by some
simple alteration in the flue   in church  he held his double eye glass
to his eyes during the morning hymn  and then lifted up his head erect
and sang out loud and joyfully   he made the responses louder than the
clerk an old man with a piping feeble voice  who  i think  felt
aggrieved at the captain s sonorous bass  and quivered higher and higher
in consequence 

on coming out of church  the brisk captain paid the most gallant
attention to his two daughters   he nodded and smiled to his
acquaintances  but he shook hands with none until he had helped miss
brown to unfurl her umbrella  had relieved her of her prayer book  and
had waited patiently till she  with trembling nervous hands  had taken
up her gown to walk through the wet roads 

i wonder what the cranford ladies did with captain brown at their
parties   we had often rejoiced  in former days  that there was no
gentleman to be attended to  and to find conversation for  at the
card parties   we had congratulated ourselves upon the snugness of the
evenings  and  in our love for gentility  and distaste of mankind  we
had almost persuaded ourselves that to be a man was to be  vulgar   so
that when i found my friend and hostess  miss jenkyns  was going to have
a party in my honour  and that captain and the miss browns were invited 
i wondered much what would be the course of the evening   card tables 
with green baize tops  were set out by daylight  just as usual  it was
the third week in november  so the evenings closed in about four 
candles  and clean packs of cards  were arranged on each table   the
fire was made up  the neat maid servant had received her last
directions  and there we stood  dressed in our best  each with a
candle lighter in our hands  ready to dart at the candles as soon as the
first knock came   parties in cranford were solemn festivities  making
the ladies feel gravely elated as they sat together in their best
dresses   as soon as three had arrived  we sat down to  preference   i
being the unlucky fourth   the next four comers were put down
immediately to another table  and presently the tea trays  which i had
seen set out in the store room as i passed in the morning  were placed
each on the middle of a card table  the china was delicate egg shell 
the old fashioned silver glittered with polishing  but the eatables were
of the slightest description   while the trays were yet on the tables 
captain and the miss browns came in  and i could see that  somehow or
other  the captain was a favourite with all the ladies present   ruffled
brows were smoothed  sharp voices lowered at his approach   miss brown
looked ill  and depressed almost to gloom  miss jessie smiled as usual 
and seemed nearly as popular as her father  he immediately and quietly
assumed the man s place in the room  attended to every one s wants 
lessened the pretty maid servant s labour by waiting on empty cups and
bread and butterless ladies  and yet did it all in so easy and dignified
a manner  and so much as if it were a matter of course for the strong to
attend to the weak  that he was a true man throughout   he played for
threepenny points with as grave an interest as if they had been pounds 
and yet  in all his attention to strangers  he had an eye on his
suffering daughter for suffering i was sure she was  though to many eyes
she might only appear to be irritable   miss jessie could not play
cards  but she talked to the sitters out  who  before her coming  had
been rather inclined to be cross   she sang  too  to an old cracked
piano  which i think had been a spinet in its youth   miss jessie sang 
 jock of hazeldean  a little out of tune  but we were none of us
musical  though miss jenkyns beat time  out of time  by way of appearing
to be so 

it was very good of miss jenkyns to do this  for i had seen that  a
little before  she had been a good deal annoyed by miss jessie brown s
unguarded admission     propos  of shetland wool  that she had an uncle 
her mother s brother  who was a shopkeeper in edinburgh   miss jenkyns
tried to drown this confession by a terrible cough for the honourable
mrs jamieson was sitting at a card table nearest miss jessie  and what
would she say or think if she found out she was in the same room with a
shop keeper s niece   but miss jessie brown  who had no tact  as we all
agreed the next morning   would  repeat the information  and assure miss
pole she could easily get her the identical shetland wool required 
 through my uncle  who has the best assortment of shetland goods of any
one in edinbro     it was to take the taste of this out of our mouths 
and the sound of this out of our ears  that miss jenkyns proposed music 
so i say again  it was very good of her to beat time to the song 

when the trays re appeared with biscuits and wine  punctually at a
quarter to nine  there was conversation  comparing of cards  and talking
over tricks  but by and by captain brown sported a bit of literature 

 have you seen any numbers of  the pickwick papers    said he    they
were then publishing in parts     capital thing  

now miss jenkyns was daughter of a deceased rector of cranford  and  on
the strength of a number of manuscript sermons  and a pretty good
library of divinity  considered herself literary  and looked upon any
conversation about books as a challenge to her   so she answered and
said   yes  she had seen them  indeed  she might say she had read them  

 and what do you think of them   exclaimed captain brown    aren t they
famously good  

so urged miss jenkyns could not but speak 

 i must say  i don t think they are by any means equal to dr johnson 
still  perhaps  the author is young   let him persevere  and who knows
what he may become if he will take the great doctor for his model  
this was evidently too much for captain brown to take placidly  and i
saw the words on the tip of his tongue before miss jenkyns had finished
her sentence 

 it is quite a different sort of thing  my dear madam   he began 

 i am quite aware of that   returned she    and i make allowances 
captain brown  

 just allow me to read you a scene out of this month s number   pleaded
he    i had it only this morning  and i don t think the company can have
read it yet  

 as you please   said she  settling herself with an air of resignation 
he read the account of the  swarry  which sam weller gave at bath   some
of us laughed heartily    i  did not dare  because i was staying in the
house   miss jenkyns sat in patient gravity   when it was ended  she
turned to me  and said with mild dignity 

 fetch me  rasselas   my dear  out of the book room  

when i had brought it to her  she turned to captain brown 

 now allow  me  to read you a scene  and then the present company can
judge between your favourite  mr boz  and dr johnson  

she read one of the conversations between rasselas and imlac  in a
high pitched  majestic voice  and when she had ended  she said   i
imagine i am now justified in my preference of dr johnson as a writer of
fiction    the captain screwed his lips up  and drummed on the table 
but he did not speak   she thought she would give him a finishing blow
or two 

          picture  endeavouring to beguile her into conversation 

 i consider it vulgar  and below the dignity of literature  to publish
in numbers  

 how was the  rambler  published  ma am   asked captain brown in a low
voice  which i think miss jenkyns could not have heard 

 dr johnson s style is a model for young beginners   my father
recommended it to me when i began to write letters i have formed my own
style upon it  i recommended it to your favourite  

 i should be very sorry for him to exchange his style for any such
pompous writing   said captain brown 

miss jenkyns felt this as a personal affront  in a way of which the
captain had not dreamed   epistolary writing she and her friends
considered as her  forte    many a copy of many a letter have i seen
written and corrected on the slate  before she  seized the half hour
just previous to post time to assure  her friends of this or of that 
and dr johnson was  as she said  her model in these compositions   she
drew herself up with dignity  and only replied to captain brown s last
remark by saying  with marked emphasis on every syllable   i prefer dr
johnson to mr boz  

it is said i won t vouch for the fact that captain brown was heard to
say   sotto voce    d n dr johnson    if he did  he was penitent
afterwards  as he showed by going to stand near miss jenkyns  arm chair 
and endeavouring to beguile her into conversation on some more pleasing
subject   but she was inexorable   the next day she made the remark i
have mentioned about miss jessie s dimples 




chapter ii 
the captain


it was impossible to live a month at cranford and not know the daily
habits of each resident  and long before my visit was ended i knew much
concerning the whole brown trio   there was nothing new to be discovered
respecting their poverty  for they had spoken simply and openly about
that from the very first   they made no mystery of the necessity for
their being economical   all that remained to be discovered was the
captain s infinite kindness of heart  and the various modes in which 
unconsciously to himself  he manifested it   some little anecdotes were
talked about for some time after they occurred   as we did not read
much  and as all the ladies were pretty well suited with servants  there
was a dearth of subjects for conversation   we therefore discussed the
circumstance of the captain taking a poor old woman s dinner out of her
hands one very slippery sunday   he had met her returning from the
bakehouse as he came from church  and noticed her precarious footing 
and  with the grave dignity with which he did everything  he relieved
her of her burden  and steered along the street by her side  carrying
her baked mutton and potatoes safely home   this was thought very
eccentric  and it was rather expected that he would pay a round of
calls  on the monday morning  to explain and apologise to the cranford
sense of propriety  but he did no such thing  and then it was decided
that he was ashamed  and was keeping out of sight   in a kindly pity for
him  we began to say   after all  the sunday morning s occurrence showed
great goodness of heart   and it was resolved that he should be
comforted on his next appearance amongst us  but  lo  he came down upon
us  untouched by any sense of shame  speaking loud and bass as ever  his
head thrown back  his wig as jaunty and well curled as usual  and we
were obliged to conclude he had forgotten all about sunday 

miss pole and miss jessie brown had set up a kind of intimacy on the
strength of the shetland wool and the new knitting stitches  so it
happened that when i went to visit miss pole i saw more of the browns
than i had done while staying with miss jenkyns  who had never got over
what she called captain brown s disparaging remarks upon dr johnson as a
writer of light and agreeable fiction   i found that miss brown was
seriously ill of some lingering  incurable complaint  the pain
occasioned by which gave the uneasy expression to her face that i had
taken for unmitigated crossness   cross  too  she was at times  when the
nervous irritability occasioned by her disease became past endurance 
miss jessie bore with her at these times  even more patiently than she
did with the bitter self upbraidings by which they were invariably
succeeded  miss brown used to accuse herself  not merely of hasty and
irritable temper  but also of being the cause why her father and sister
were obliged to pinch  in order to allow her the small luxuries which
were necessaries in her condition   she would so fain have made
sacrifices for them  and have lightened their cares  that the original
generosity of her disposition added acerbity to her temper   all this
was borne by miss jessie and her father with more than placidity with
absolute tenderness  i forgave miss jessie her singing out of tune  and
her juvenility of dress  when i saw her at home   i came to perceive
that captain brown s dark brutus wig and padded coat  alas  too often
threadbare  were remnants of the military smartness of his youth  which
he now wore unconsciously   he was a man of infinite resources  gained
in his barrack experience   as he confessed  no one could black his
boots to please him except himself  but  indeed  he was not above saving
the little maid servant s labours in every way knowing  most likely 
that his daughter s illness made the place a hard one 

he endeavoured to make peace with miss jenkyns soon after the memorable
dispute i have named  by a present of a wooden fire shovel  his own
making   having heard her say how much the grating of an iron one
annoyed her   she received the present with cool gratitude  and thanked
him formally   when he was gone  she bade me put it away in the
lumber room  feeling  probably  that no present from a man who preferred
mr boz to dr johnson could be less jarring than an iron fire shovel 

such was the state of things when i left cranford and went to drumble 
i had  however  several correspondents  who kept me  au fait  as to the
proceedings of the dear little town   there was miss pole  who was
becoming as much absorbed in crochet as she had been once in knitting 
and the burden of whose letter was something like   but don t you forget
the white worsted at flint s  of the old song  for at the end of every
sentence of news came a fresh direction as to some crochet commission
which i was to execute for her   miss matilda jenkyns  who did not mind
being called miss matty  when miss jenkyns was not by  wrote nice  kind 
rambling letters  now and then venturing into an opinion of her own  but
suddenly pulling herself up  and either begging me not to name what she
had said  as deborah thought differently  and  she  knew  or else
putting in a postscript to the effect that  since writing the above  she
had been talking over the subject with deborah  and was quite convinced
that  etc   here probably followed a recantation of every opinion she
had given in the letter    then came miss jenkyns deborah  as she liked
miss matty to call her  her father having once said that the hebrew name
ought to be so pronounced   i secretly think she took the hebrew
prophetess for a model in character  and  indeed  she was not unlike the
stern prophetess in some ways  making allowance  of course  for modern
customs and difference in dress   miss jenkyns wore a cravat  and a
little bonnet like a jockey cap  and altogether had the appearance of a
strong minded woman  although she would have despised the modern idea of
women being equal to men   equal  indeed  she knew they were superior 
but to return to her letters   everything in them was stately and grand
like herself  i have been looking them over  dear miss jenkyns  how i
honoured her   and i will give an extract  more especially because it
relates to our friend captain brown  

 the honourable mrs jamieson has only just quitted me  and  in the
course of conversation  she communicated to me the intelligence that she
had yesterday received a call from her revered husband s quondam friend 
lord mauleverer   you will not easily conjecture what brought his
lordship within the precincts of our little town   it was to see captain
brown  with whom  it appears  his lordship was acquainted in the  plumed
wars   and who had the privilege of averting destruction from his
lordship s head when some great peril was impending over it  off the
misnomered cape of good hope   you know our friend the honourable mrs
jamieson s deficiency in the spirit of innocent curiosity  and you will
therefore not be so much surprised when i tell you she was quite unable
to disclose to me the exact nature of the peril in question   i was
anxious  i confess  to ascertain in what manner captain brown  with his
limited establishment  could receive so distinguished a guest  and i
discovered that his lordship retired to rest  and  let us hope  to
refreshing slumbers  at the angel hotel  but shared the brunonian meals
during the two days that he honoured cranford with his august presence 
mrs johnson  our civil butcher s wife  informs me that miss jessie
purchased a leg of lamb  but  besides this  i can hear of no preparation
whatever to give a suitable reception to so distinguished a visitor 
perhaps they entertained him with  the feast of reason and the flow of
soul   and to us  who are acquainted with captain brown s sad want of
relish for  the pure wells of english undefiled   it may be matter for
congratulation that he has had the opportunity of improving his taste by
holding converse with an elegant and refined member of the british
aristocracy  but from some mundane failings who is altogether free  

miss pole and miss matty wrote to me by the same post   such a piece of
news as lord mauleverer s visit was not to be lost on the cranford
letter writers  they made the most of it   miss matty humbly apologised
for writing at the same time as her sister  who was so much more capable
than she to describe the honour done to cranford  but in spite of a
little bad spelling  miss matty s account gave me the best idea of the
commotion occasioned by his lordship s visit  after it had occurred 
for  except the people at the angel  the browns  mrs jamieson  and a
little lad his lordship had sworn at for driving a dirty hoop against
the aristocratic legs  i could not hear of any one with whom his
lordship had held conversation 

my next visit to cranford was in the summer   there had been neither
births  deaths  nor marriages since i was there last   everybody lived
in the same house  and wore pretty nearly the same well preserved 
old fashioned clothes   the greatest event was  that miss jenkyns had
purchased a new carpet for the drawing room   oh  the busy work miss
matty and i had in chasing the sunbeams  as they fell in an afternoon
right down on this carpet through the blindless window   we spread
newspapers over the places and sat down to our book or our work  and 
lo  in a quarter of an hour the sun had moved  and was blazing away on a
fresh spot  and down again we went on our knees to alter the position of
the newspapers   we were very busy  too  one whole morning  before miss
jenkyns gave her party  in following her directions  and in cutting out
and stitching together pieces of newspaper so as to form little paths to
every chair set for the expected visitors  lest their shoes might dirty
or defile the purity of the carpet   do you make paper paths for every
guest to walk upon in london 

captain brown and miss jenkyns were not very cordial to each other   the
literary dispute  of which i had seen the beginning  was a  raw   the
slightest touch on which made them wince   it was the only difference of
opinion they had ever had  but that difference was enough   miss jenkyns
could not refrain from talking at captain brown  and  though he did not
reply  he drummed with his fingers  which action she felt and resented
as very disparaging to dr johnson   he was rather ostentatious in his
preference of the writings of mr boz  would walk through the streets so
absorbed in them that he all but ran against miss jenkyns  and though
his apologies were earnest and sincere  and though he did not  in fact 
do more than startle her and himself  she owned to me she had rather he
had knocked her down  if he had only been reading a higher style of
literature   the poor  brave captain  he looked older  and more worn 
and his clothes were very threadbare   but he seemed as bright and
cheerful as ever  unless he was asked about his daughter s health 

 she suffers a great deal  and she must suffer more  we do what we can
to alleviate her pain  god s will be done    he took off his hat at
these last words   i found  from miss matty  that everything had been
done  in fact   a medical man  of high repute in that country
neighbourhood  had been sent for  and every injunction he had given was
attended to  regardless of expense   miss matty was sure they denied
themselves many things in order to make the invalid comfortable  but
they never spoke about it  and as for miss jessie   i really think she s
an angel   said poor miss matty  quite overcome    to see her way of
bearing with miss brown s crossness  and the bright face she puts on
after she s been sitting up a whole night and scolded above half of it 
is quite beautiful   yet she looks as neat and as ready to welcome the
captain at breakfast time as if she had been asleep in the queen s bed
all night  my dear  you could never laugh at her prim little curls or
her pink bows again if you saw her as i have done    i could only feel
very penitent  and greet miss jessie with double respect when i met her
next   she looked faded and pinched  and her lips began to quiver  as if
she was very weak  when she spoke of her sister   but she brightened 
and sent back the tears that were glittering in her pretty eyes  as she
said 

 but  to be sure  what a town cranford is for kindness   i don t suppose
any one has a better dinner than usual cooked but the best part of all
comes in a little covered basin for my sister   the poor people will
leave their earliest vegetables at our door for her   they speak short
and gruff  as if they were ashamed of it  but i am sure it often goes to
my heart to see their thoughtfulness    the tears now came back and
overflowed  but after a minute or two she began to scold herself  and
ended by going away the same cheerful miss jessie as ever 

 but why does not this lord mauleverer do something for the man who
saved his life   said i 

 why  you see  unless captain brown has some reason for it  he never
speaks about being poor  and he walked along by his lordship looking as
happy and cheerful as a prince  and as they never called attention to
their dinner by apologies  and as miss brown was better that day  and
all seemed bright  i daresay his lordship never knew how much care there
was in the background   he did send game in the winter pretty often  but
now he is gone abroad  

i had often occasion to notice the use that was made of fragments and
small opportunities in cranford  the rose leaves that were gathered ere
they fell to make into a potpourri for someone who had no garden  the
little bundles of lavender flowers sent to strew the drawers of some
town dweller  or to burn in the chamber of some invalid   things that
many would despise  and actions which it seemed scarcely worth while to
perform  were all attended to in cranford   miss jenkyns stuck an apple
full of cloves  to be heated and smell pleasantly in miss brown s room 
and as she put in each clove she uttered a johnsonian sentence   indeed 
she never could think of the browns without talking johnson  and  as
they were seldom absent from her thoughts just then  i heard many a
rolling  three piled sentence 

captain brown called one day to thank miss jenkyns for many little
kindnesses  which i did not know until then that she had rendered   he
had suddenly become like an old man  his deep bass voice had a quavering
in it  his eyes looked dim  and the lines on his face were deep   he did
not could not speak cheerfully of his daughter s state  but he talked
with manly  pious resignation  and not much   twice over he said   what
jessie has been to us  god only knows   and after the second time  he
got up hastily  shook hands all round without speaking  and left the
room 

that afternoon we perceived little groups in the street  all listening
with faces aghast to some tale or other   miss jenkyns wondered what
could be the matter for some time before she took the undignified step
of sending jenny out to inquire 

jenny came back with a white face of terror    oh  ma am   oh  miss
jenkyns  ma am   captain brown is killed by them nasty cruel railroads  
and she burst into tears   she  along with many others  had experienced
the poor captain s kindness 

 how  where where   good god   jenny  don t waste time in crying  but
tell us something    miss matty rushed out into the street at once  and
collared the man who was telling the tale 

  picture  she brought the affrighted carter     into the
drawing room 

 come in come to my sister at once  miss jenkyns  the rector s daughter 
oh  man  man  say it is not true   she cried  as she brought the
affrighted carter  sleeking down his hair  into the drawing room  where
he stood with his wet boots on the new carpet  and no one regarded it 

 please  mum  it is true   i seed it myself   and he shuddered at the
recollection    the captain was a reading some new book as he was deep
in  a waiting for the down train  and there was a little lass as wanted
to come to its mammy  and gave its sister the slip  and came toddling
across the line   and he looked up sudden  at the sound of the train
coming  and seed the child  and he darted on the line and cotched it up 
and his foot slipped  and the train came over him in no time   o lord 
lord   mum  it s quite true  and they ve come over to tell his
daughters  the child s safe  though  with only a bang on its shoulder as
he threw it to its mammy   poor captain would be glad of that  mum 
wouldn t he   god bless him    the great rough carter puckered up his
manly face  and turned away to hide his tears   i turned to miss
jenkyns   she looked very ill  as if she were going to faint  and signed
to me to open the window 

 matilda  bring me my bonnet   i must go to those girls   god pardon me 
if ever i have spoken contemptuously to the captain  

miss jenkyns arrayed herself to go out  telling miss matilda to give the
man a glass of wine   while she was away  miss matty and i huddled over
the fire  talking in a low and awestruck voice   i know we cried quietly
all the time 

miss jenkyns came home in a silent mood  and we durst not ask her many
questions   she told us that miss jessie had fainted  and that she and
miss pole had had some difficulty in bringing her round  but that  as
soon as she recovered  she begged one of them to go and sit with her
sister 

 mr hoggins says she cannot live many days  and she shall be spared this
shock   said miss jessie  shivering with feelings to which she dared not
give way 

 but how can you manage  my dear   asked miss jenkyns   you cannot bear
up  she must see your tears  

 god will help me i will not give way she was asleep when the news came 
she may be asleep yet   she would be so utterly miserable  not merely at
my father s death  but to think of what would become of me  she is so
good to me    she looked up earnestly in their faces with her soft true
eyes  and miss pole told miss jenkyns afterwards she could hardly bear
it  knowing  as she did  how miss brown treated her sister 

however  it was settled according to miss jessie s wish   miss brown was
to be told her father had been summoned to take a short journey on
railway business   they had managed it in some way miss jenkyns could
not exactly say how   miss pole was to stop with miss jessie   mrs
jamieson had sent to inquire   and this was all we heard that night  and
a sorrowful night it was   the next day a full account of the fatal
accident was in the county paper which miss jenkyns took in   her eyes
were very weak  she said  and she asked me to read it   when i came to
the  gallant gentleman was deeply engaged in the perusal of a number of
 pickwick   which he had just received   miss jenkyns shook her head
long and solemnly  and then sighed out   poor  dear  infatuated man  

the corpse was to be taken from the station to the parish church  there
to be interred   miss jessie had set her heart on following it to the
grave  and no dissuasives could alter her resolve   her restraint upon
herself made her almost obstinate  she resisted all miss pole s
entreaties and miss jenkyns  advice   at last miss jenkyns gave up the
point  and after a silence  which i feared portended some deep
displeasure against miss jessie  miss jenkyns said she should accompany
the latter to the funeral 

 it is not fit for you to go alone   it would be against both propriety
and humanity were i to allow it  

miss jessie seemed as if she did not half like this arrangement  but her
obstinacy  if she had any  had been exhausted in her determination to go
to the interment   she longed  poor thing  i have no doubt  to cry alone
over the grave of the dear father to whom she had been all in all  and
to give way  for one little half hour  uninterrupted by sympathy and
unobserved by friendship   but it was not to be   that afternoon miss
jenkyns sent out for a yard of black crape  and employed herself busily
in trimming the little black silk bonnet i have spoken about   when it
was finished she put it on  and looked at us for approbation admiration
she despised   i was full of sorrow  but  by one of those whimsical
thoughts which come unbidden into our heads  in times of deepest grief 
i no sooner saw the bonnet than i was reminded of a helmet  and in that
hybrid bonnet  half helmet  half jockey cap  did miss jenkyns attend
captain brown s funeral  and  i believe  supported miss jessie with a
tender  indulgent firmness which was invaluable  allowing her to weep
her passionate fill before they left 

miss pole  miss matty  and i  meanwhile attended to miss brown  and hard
work we found it to relieve her querulous and never ending complaints 
but if we were so weary and dispirited  what must miss jessie have been 
yet she came back almost calm as if she had gained a new strength   she
put off her mourning dress  and came in  looking pale and gentle 
thanking us each with a soft long pressure of the hand   she could even
smile a faint  sweet  wintry smile as if to reassure us of her power to
endure  but her look made our eyes fill suddenly with tears  more than
if she had cried outright 

it was settled that miss pole was to remain with her all the watching
livelong night  and that miss matty and i were to return in the morning
to relieve them  and give miss jessie the opportunity for a few hours of
sleep   but when the morning came  miss jenkyns appeared at the
breakfast table  equipped in her helmet bonnet  and ordered miss matty
to stay at home  as she meant to go and help to nurse   she was
evidently in a state of great friendly excitement  which she showed by
eating her breakfast standing  and scolding the household all round 

no nursing no energetic strong minded woman could help miss brown now 
there was that in the room as we entered which was stronger than us all 
and made us shrink into solemn awestruck helplessness   miss brown was
dying   we hardly knew her voice  it was so devoid of the complaining
tone we had always associated with it   miss jessie told me afterwards
that it  and her face too  were just what they had been formerly  when
her mother s death left her the young anxious head of the family  of
whom only miss jessie survived 

she was conscious of her sister s presence  though not  i think  of
ours  we stood a little behind the curtain  miss jessie knelt with her
face near her sister s  in order to catch the last soft awful whispers 

 oh  jessie   jessie   how selfish i have been   god forgive me for
letting you sacrifice yourself for me as you did   i have so loved
you and yet i have thought only of myself   god forgive me  

 hush  love  hush   said miss jessie  sobbing 

 and my father  my dear  dear father   i will not complain now  if god
will give me strength to be patient   but  oh  jessie  tell my father
how i longed and yearned to see him at last  and to ask his forgiveness 
 he can never know now how i loved him oh  if i might but tell him 
before i die   what a life of sorrow his has been  and i have done so
little to cheer him  

a light came into miss jessie s face    would it comfort you  dearest 
to think that he does know  would it comfort you  love  to know that his
cares  his sorrows  her voice quivered  but she steadied it into
calmness  mary  he has gone before you to the place where the weary are
at rest   he knows now how you loved him  

a strange look  which was not distress  came over miss brown s face 
she did not speak for some time  but then we saw her lips form the
words  rather than heard the sound  father  mother  harry  archy   then 
as if it were a new idea throwing a filmy shadow over her darkened
mind  but you will be alone  jessie  

miss jessie had been feeling this all during the silence  i think  for
the tears rolled down her cheeks like rain  at these words  and she
could not answer at first   then she put her hands together tight  and
lifted them up  and said but not to us  though he slay me  yet will i
trust in him  

in a few moments more miss brown lay calm and still never to sorrow or
murmur more 

after this second funeral  miss jenkyns insisted that miss jessie should
come to stay with her rather than go back to the desolate house  which 
in fact  we learned from miss jessie  must now be given up  as she had
not wherewithal to maintain it   she had something above twenty pounds a
year  besides the interest of the money for which the furniture would
sell  but she could not live upon that  and so we talked over her
qualifications for earning money 

 i can sew neatly   said she   and i like nursing   i think  too  i
could manage a house  if any one would try me as housekeeper  or i would
go into a shop as saleswoman  if they would have patience with me at
first  

miss jenkyns declared  in an angry voice  that she should do no such
thing  and talked to herself about  some people having no idea of their
rank as a captain s daughter   nearly an hour afterwards  when she
brought miss jessie up a basin of delicately made arrowroot  and stood
over her like a dragoon until the last spoonful was finished  then she
disappeared   miss jessie began to tell me some more of the plans which
had suggested themselves to her  and insensibly fell into talking of the
days that were past and gone  and interested me so much i neither knew
nor heeded how time passed   we were both startled when miss jenkyns
reappeared  and caught us crying   i was afraid lest she would be
displeased  as she often said that crying hindered digestion  and i knew
she wanted miss jessie to get strong  but  instead  she looked queer and
excited  and fidgeted round us without saying anything   at last she
spoke 

 i have been so much startled no  i ve not been at all startled don t
mind me  my dear miss jessie i ve been very much surprised in fact  i ve
had a caller  whom you knew once  my dear miss jessie  

miss jessie went very white  then flushed scarlet  and looked eagerly at
miss jenkyns 

 a gentleman  my dear  who wants to know if you would see him  

 is it  it is not  stammered out miss jessie and got no farther 

 this is his card   said miss jenkyns  giving it to miss jessie  and
while her head was bent over it  miss jenkyns went through a series of
winks and odd faces to me  and formed her lips into a long sentence  of
which  of course  i could not understand a word 

 may he come up   asked miss jenkyns at last 

 oh  yes  certainly   said miss jessie  as much as to say  this is your
house  you may show any visitor where you like   she took up some
knitting of miss matty s and began to be very busy  though i could see
how she trembled all over 

miss jenkyns rang the bell  and told the servant who answered it to show
major gordon upstairs  and  presently  in walked a tall  fine 
frank looking man of forty or upwards   he shook hands with miss jessie 
but he could not see her eyes  she kept them so fixed on the ground 
miss jenkyns asked me if i would come and help her to tie up the
preserves in the store room  and though miss jessie plucked at my gown 
and even looked up at me with begging eye  i durst not refuse to go
where miss jenkyns asked   instead of tying up preserves in the
store room  however  we went to talk in the dining room  and there miss
jenkyns told me what major gordon had told her  how he had served in the
same regiment with captain brown  and had become acquainted with miss
jessie  then a sweet looking  blooming girl of eighteen  how the
acquaintance had grown into love on his part  though it had been some
years before he had spoken  how  on becoming possessed  through the will
of an uncle  of a good estate in scotland  he had offered and been
refused  though with so much agitation and evident distress that he was
sure she was not indifferent to him  and how he had discovered that the
obstacle was the fell disease which was  even then  too surely
threatening her sister  she had mentioned that the surgeons foretold
intense suffering  and there was no one but herself to nurse her poor
mary  or cheer and comfort her father during the time of illness   they
had had long discussions  and on her refusal to pledge herself to him as
his wife when all should be over  he had grown angry  and broken off
entirely  and gone abroad  believing that she was a cold hearted person
whom he would do well to forget   he had been travelling in the east 
and was on his return home when  at rome  he saw the account of captain
brown s death in  galignani  

just then miss matty  who had been out all the morning  and had only
lately returned to the house  burst in with a face of dismay and
outraged propriety 

 oh  goodness me   she said    deborah  there s a gentleman sitting in
the drawing room with his arm round miss jessie s waist    miss matty s
eyes looked large with terror 

           picture   with his arm around miss jessie s waist   

miss jenkyns snubbed her down in an instant 

 the most proper place in the world for his arm to be in   go away 
matilda  and mind your own business    this from her sister  who had
hitherto been a model of feminine decorum  was a blow for poor miss
matty  and with a double shock she left the room 

the last time i ever saw poor miss jenkyns was many years after this 
mrs gordon had kept up a warm and affectionate intercourse with all at
cranford   miss jenkyns  miss matty  and miss pole had all been to visit
her  and returned with wonderful accounts of her house  her husband  her
dress  and her looks   for  with happiness  something of her early bloom
returned  she had been a year or two younger than we had taken her for 
her eyes were always lovely  and  as mrs gordon  her dimples were not
out of place   at the time to which i have referred  when i last saw
miss jenkyns  that lady was old and feeble  and had lost something of
her strong mind   little flora gordon was staying with the misses
jenkyns  and when i came in she was reading aloud to miss jenkyns  who
lay feeble and changed on the sofa   flora put down the  rambler  when i
came in 

 ah   said miss jenkyns   you find me changed  my dear   i can t see as
i used to do   if flora were not here to read to me  i hardly know how i
should get through the day   did you ever read the  rambler    it s a
wonderful book wonderful  and the most improving reading for flora 
 which i daresay it would have been  if she could have read half the
words without spelling  and could have understood the meaning of a
third    better than that strange old book  with the queer name  poor
captain brown was killed for reading that book by mr boz  you know  old
poz   when i was a girl but that s a long time ago i acted lucy in  old
poz     she babbled on long enough for flora to get a good long spell at
the  christmas carol   which miss matty had left on the table 




chapter iii 
a love affair of long ago


i thought that probably my connection with cranford would cease after
miss jenkyns s death  at least  that it would have to be kept up by
correspondence  which bears much the same relation to personal
intercourse that the books of dried plants i sometimes see   hortus
siccus   i think they call the thing  do to the living and fresh flowers
in the lanes and meadows   i was pleasantly surprised  therefore  by
receiving a letter from miss pole  who had always come in for a
supplementary week after my annual visit to miss jenkyns  proposing that
i should go and stay with her  and then  in a couple of days after my
acceptance  came a note from miss matty  in which  in a rather
circuitous and very humble manner  she told me how much pleasure i
should confer if i could spend a week or two with her  either before or
after i had been at miss pole s   for   she said   since my dear
sister s death i am well aware i have no attractions to offer  it is
only to the kindness of my friends that i can owe their company  

of course i promised to come to dear miss matty as soon as i had ended
my visit to miss pole  and the day after my arrival at cranford i went
to see her  much wondering what the house would be like without miss
jenkyns  and rather dreading the changed aspect of things   miss matty
began to cry as soon as she saw me   she was evidently nervous from
having anticipated my call   i comforted her as well as i could  and i
found the best consolation i could give was the honest praise that came
from my heart as i spoke of the deceased   miss matty slowly shook her
head over each virtue as it was named and attributed to her sister  and
at last she could not restrain the tears which had long been silently
flowing  but hid her face behind her handkerchief and sobbed aloud 

 dear miss matty   said i  taking her hand for indeed i did not know in
what way to tell her how sorry i was for her  left deserted in the
world  she put down her handkerchief and said 

 my dear  i d rather you did not call me matty   she did not like it 
but i did many a thing she did not like  i m afraid and now she s gone 
if you please  my love  will you call me matilda  

i promised faithfully  and began to practise the new name with miss pole
that very day  and  by degrees  miss matilda s feeling on the subject
was known through cranford  and we all tried to drop the more familiar
name  but with so little success that by and by we gave up the attempt 

my visit to miss pole was very quiet   miss jenkyns had so long taken
the lead in cranford that now she was gone  they hardly knew how to give
a party   the honourable mrs jamieson  to whom miss jenkyns herself had
always yielded the post of honour  was fat and inert  and very much at
the mercy of her old servants   if they chose that she should give a
party  they reminded her of the necessity for so doing  if not  she let
it alone   there was all the more time for me to hear old world stories
from miss pole  while she sat knitting  and i making my father s shirts 
i always took a quantity of plain sewing to cranford  for  as we did not
read much  or walk much  i found it a capital time to get through my
work   one of miss pole s stories related to a shadow of a love affair
that was dimly perceived or suspected long years before 

presently  the time arrived when i was to remove to miss matilda s
house  i found her timid and anxious about the arrangements for my
comfort  many a time  while i was unpacking  did she come backwards and
forwards to stir the fire which burned all the worse for being so
frequently poked 

 have you drawers enough  dear   asked she    i don t know exactly how
my sister used to arrange them   she had capital methods   i am sure she
would have trained a servant in a week to make a better fire than this 
and fanny has been with me four months  

this subject of servants was a standing grievance  and i could not
wonder much at it  for if gentlemen were scarce  and almost unheard of
in the  genteel society  of cranford  they or their
counterparts handsome young men abounded in the lower classes   the
pretty neat servant maids had their choice of desirable  followers   and
their mistresses  without having the sort of mysterious dread of men and
matrimony that miss matilda had  might well feel a little anxious lest
the heads of their comely maids should be turned by the joiner  or the
butcher  or the gardener  who were obliged  by their callings  to come
to the house  and who  as ill luck would have it  were generally
handsome and unmarried  fanny s lovers  if she had any and miss matilda
suspected her of so many flirtations that  if she had not been very
pretty  i should have doubted her having one were a constant anxiety to
her mistress   she was forbidden  by the articles of her engagement  to
have  followers   and though she had answered  innocently enough 
doubling up the hem of her apron as she spoke   please  ma am  i never
had more than one at a time   miss matty prohibited that one   but a
vision of a man seemed to haunt the kitchen   fanny assured me that it
was all fancy  or else i should have said myself that i had seen a man s
coat tails whisk into the scullery once  when i went on an errand into
the store room at night  and another evening  when  our watches having
stopped  i went to look at the clock  there was a very odd appearance 
singularly like a young man squeezed up between the clock and the back
of the open kitchen door  and i thought fanny snatched up the candle
very hastily  so as to throw the shadow on the clock face  while she
very positively told me the time half an hour too early  as we found out
afterwards by the church clock  but i did not add to miss matty s
anxieties by naming my suspicions  especially as fanny said to me  the
next day  that it was such a queer kitchen for having odd shadows about
it  she really was almost afraid to stay   for you know  miss   she
added   i don t see a creature from six o clock tea  till missus rings
the bell for prayers at ten  

however  it so fell out that fanny had to leave and miss matilda begged
me to stay and  settle her  with the new maid  to which i consented 
after i had heard from my father that he did not want me at home   the
new servant was a rough  honest looking  country girl  who had only
lived in a farm place before  but i liked her looks when she came to be
hired  and i promised miss matilda to put her in the ways of the house 
the said ways were religiously such as miss matilda thought her sister
would approve   many a domestic rule and regulation had been a subject
of plaintive whispered murmur to me during miss jenkyns s life  but now
that she was gone  i do not think that even i  who was a favourite 
durst have suggested an alteration   to give an instance  we constantly
adhered to the forms which were observed  at meal times  in  my father 
the rector s house    accordingly  we had always wine and dessert  but
the decanters were only filled when there was a party  and what remained
was seldom touched  though we had two wine glasses apiece every day
after dinner  until the next festive occasion arrived  when the state of
the remainder wine was examined into in a family council   the dregs
were often given to the poor  but occasionally  when a good deal had
been left at the last party  five months ago  it might be   it was added
to some of a fresh bottle  brought up from the cellar   i fancy poor
captain brown did not much like wine  for i noticed he never finished
his first glass  and most military men take several   then  as to our
dessert  miss jenkyns used to gather currants and gooseberries for it
herself  which i sometimes thought would have tasted better fresh from
the trees  but then  as miss jenkyns observed  there would have been
nothing for dessert in summer time   as it was  we felt very genteel
with our two glasses apiece  and a dish of gooseberries at the top  of
currants and biscuits at the sides  and two decanters at the bottom 
when oranges came in  a curious proceeding was gone through   miss
jenkyns did not like to cut the fruit  for  as she observed  the juice
all ran out nobody knew where  sucking  only i think she used some more
recondite word  was in fact the only way of enjoying oranges  but then
there was the unpleasant association with a ceremony frequently gone
through by little babies  and so  after dessert  in orange season  miss
jenkyns and miss matty used to rise up  possess themselves each of an
orange in silence  and withdraw to the privacy of their own rooms to
indulge in sucking oranges 

i had once or twice tried  on such occasions  to prevail on miss matty
to stay  and had succeeded in her sister s lifetime   i held up a
screen  and did not look  and  as she said  she tried not to make the
noise very offensive  but now that she was left alone  she seemed quite
horrified when i begged her to remain with me in the warm
dining parlour  and enjoy her orange as she liked best   and so it was
in everything   miss jenkyns s rules were made more stringent than ever 
because the framer of them was gone where there could be no appeal   in
all things else miss matilda was meek and undecided to a fault   i have
heard fanny turn her round twenty times in a morning about dinner  just
as the little hussy chose  and i sometimes fancied she worked on miss
matilda s weakness in order to bewilder her  and to make her feel more
in the power of her clever servant   i determined that i would not leave
her till i had seen what sort of a person martha was  and  if i found
her trustworthy  i would tell her not to trouble her mistress with every
little decision 

martha was blunt and plain spoken to a fault  otherwise she was a brisk 
well meaning  but very ignorant girl   she had not been with us a week
before miss matilda and i were astounded one morning by the receipt of a
letter from a cousin of hers  who had been twenty or thirty years in
india  and who had lately  as we had seen by the  army list   returned
to england  bringing with him an invalid wife who had never been
introduced to her english relations   major jenkyns wrote to propose
that he and his wife should spend a night at cranford  on his way to
scotland at the inn  if it did not suit miss matilda to receive them
into her house  in which case they should hope to be with her as much as
possible during the day  of course it  must  suit her  as she said  for
all cranford knew that she had her sister s bedroom at liberty  but i am
sure she wished the major had stopped in india and forgotten his cousins
out and out 

 oh  how must i manage   asked she helplessly    if deborah had been
alive she would have known what to do with a gentleman visitor   must i
put razors in his dressing room   dear  dear  and i ve got none 
deborah would have had them   and slippers  and coat brushes    i
suggested that probably he would bring all these things with him    and
after dinner  how am i to know when to get up and leave him to his wine 
 deborah would have done it so well  she would have been quite in her
element   will he want coffee  do you think    i undertook the
management of the coffee  and told her i would instruct martha in the
art of waiting in which it must be owned she was terribly deficient and
that i had no doubt major and mrs jenkyns would understand the quiet
mode in which a lady lived by herself in a country town   but she was
sadly fluttered   i made her empty her decanters and bring up two fresh
bottles of wine   i wished i could have prevented her from being present
at my instructions to martha  for she frequently cut in with some fresh
direction  muddling the poor girl s mind as she stood open mouthed 
listening to us both 

 hand the vegetables round   said i  foolishly  i see now for it was
aiming at more than we could accomplish with quietness and simplicity  
and then  seeing her look bewildered  i added   take the vegetables
round to people  and let them help themselves  

 and mind you go first to the ladies   put in miss matilda    always go
to the ladies before gentlemen when you are waiting  

 i ll do it as you tell me  ma am   said martha   but i like lads best  

we felt very uncomfortable and shocked at this speech of martha s  yet i
don t think she meant any harm  and  on the whole  she attended very
well to our directions  except that she  nudged  the major when he did
not help himself as soon as she expected to the potatoes  while she was
handing them round 

the major and his wife were quiet unpretending people enough when they
did come  languid  as all east indians are  i suppose   we were rather
dismayed at their bringing two servants with them  a hindoo body servant
for the major  and a steady elderly maid for his wife  but they slept at
the inn  and took off a good deal of the responsibility by attending
carefully to their master s and mistress s comfort   martha  to be sure 
had never ended her staring at the east indian s white turban and brown
complexion  and i saw that miss matilda shrunk away from him a little as
he waited at dinner   indeed  she asked me  when they were gone  if he
did not remind me of blue beard   on the whole  the visit was most
satisfactory  and is a subject of conversation even now with miss
matilda  at the time it greatly excited cranford  and even stirred up
the apathetic and honourable mrs jamieson to some expression of
interest  when i went to call and thank her for the kind answers she had
vouchsafed to miss matilda s inquiries as to the arrangement of a
gentleman s dressing room answers which i must confess she had given in
the wearied manner of the scandinavian prophetess 

                        leave me  leave me to repose  

and  now  i come to the love affair 

it seems that miss pole had a cousin  once or twice removed  who had
offered to miss matty long ago   now this cousin lived four or five
miles from cranford on his own estate  but his property was not large
enough to entitle him to rank higher than a yeoman  or rather  with
something of the  pride which apes humility   he had refused to push
himself on  as so many of his class had done  into the ranks of the
squires   he would not allow himself to be called thomas holbrook 
 esq    he even sent back letters with this address  telling the
post mistress at cranford that his name was  mr  thomas holbrook 
yeoman   he rejected all domestic innovations  he would have the house
door stand open in summer and shut in winter  without knocker or bell to
summon a servant   the closed fist or the knob of a stick did this
office for him if he found the door locked   he despised every
refinement which had not its root deep down in humanity   if people were
not ill  he saw no necessity for moderating his voice   he spoke the
dialect of the country in perfection  and constantly used it in
conversation  although miss pole  who gave me these particulars  added 
that he read aloud more beautifully and with more feeling than any one
she had ever heard  except the late rector 

 and how came miss matilda not to marry him   asked i 

 oh  i don t know   she was willing enough  i think  but you know cousin
thomas would not have been enough of a gentleman for the rector and miss
jenkyns  

 well  but they were not to marry him   said i  impatiently 

 no  but they did not like miss matty to marry below her rank   you know
she was the rector s daughter  and somehow they are related to sir peter
arley  miss jenkyns thought a deal of that  

 poor miss matty   said i 

 nay  now  i don t know anything more than that he offered and was
refused   miss matty might not like him and miss jenkyns might never
have said a word it is only a guess of mine  

 has she never seen him since   i inquired 

 no  i think not   you see woodley  cousin thomas s house  lies half way
between cranford and misselton  and i know he made misselton his
market town very soon after he had offered to miss matty  and i don t
think he has been into cranford above once or twice since once  when i
was walking with miss matty  in high street  and suddenly she darted
from me  and went up shire lane   a few minutes after i was startled by
meeting cousin thomas  

 how old is he   i asked  after a pause of castle building 

 he must be about seventy  i think  my dear   said miss pole  blowing up
my castle  as if by gun powder  into small fragments 

very soon after at least during my long visit to miss matilda i had the
opportunity of seeing mr holbrook  seeing  too  his first encounter with
his former love  after thirty or forty years  separation   i was helping
to decide whether any of the new assortment of coloured silks which they
had just received at the shop would do to match a grey and black
mousseline delaine that wanted a new breadth  when a tall  thin  don
quixote looking old man came into the shop for some woollen gloves   i
had never seen the person  who was rather striking  before  and i
watched him rather attentively while miss matty listened to the shopman 
 the stranger wore a blue coat with brass buttons  drab breeches  and
gaiters  and drummed with his fingers on the counter until he was
attended to  when he answered the shop boy s question   what can i have
the pleasure of showing you to day  sir   i saw miss matilda start  and
then suddenly sit down  and instantly i guessed who it was   she had
made some inquiry which had to be carried round to the other shopman 

 miss jenkyns wants the black sarsenet two and twopence the yard   and
mr holbrook had caught the name  and was across the shop in two strides 

 matty miss matilda miss jenkyns   god bless my soul   i should not have
known you   how are you  how are you    he kept shaking her hand in a
way which proved the warmth of his friendship  but he repeated so often 
as if to himself   i should not have known you   that any sentimental
romance which i might be inclined to build was quite done away with by
his manner 

however  he kept talking to us all the time we were in the shop  and
then waving the shopman with the unpurchased gloves on one side  with
 another time  sir  another time   he walked home with us   i am happy
to say my client  miss matilda  also left the shop in an equally
bewildered state  not having purchased either green or red silk   mr
holbrook was evidently full with honest loud spoken joy at meeting his
old love again  he touched on the changes that had taken place  he even
spoke of miss jenkyns as  your poor sister   well  well  we have all our
faults   and bade us good bye with many a hope that he should soon see
miss matty again   she went straight to her room  and never came back
till our early tea time  when i thought she looked as if she had been
crying 

               picture  mr holbrook     bade us good bye 




chapter iv 
a visit to an old bachelor


a few days after  a note came from mr holbrook  asking us impartially
asking both of us in a formal  old fashioned style  to spend a day at
his house a long june day for it was june now   he named that he had
also invited his cousin  miss pole  so that we might join in a fly 
which could be put up at his house 

i expected miss matty to jump at this invitation  but  no   miss pole
and i had the greatest difficulty in persuading her to go   she thought
it was improper  and was even half annoyed when we utterly ignored the
idea of any impropriety in her going with two other ladies to see her
old lover   then came a more serious difficulty   she did not think
deborah would have liked her to go   this took us half a day s good hard
talking to get over  but  at the first sentence of relenting  i seized
the opportunity  and wrote and despatched an acceptance in her
name fixing day and hour  that all might be decided and done with 

the next morning she asked me if i would go down to the shop with her 
and there  after much hesitation  we chose out three caps to be sent
home and tried on  that the most becoming might be selected to take with
us on thursday 

she was in a state of silent agitation all the way to woodley   she had
evidently never been there before  and  although she little dreamt i
knew anything of her early story  i could perceive she was in a tremor
at the thought of seeing the place which might have been her home  and
round which it is probable that many of her innocent girlish
imaginations had clustered   it was a long drive there  through paved
jolting lanes   miss matilda sat bolt upright  and looked wistfully out
of the windows as we drew near the end of our journey   the aspect of
the country was quiet and pastoral   woodley stood among fields  and
there was an old fashioned garden where roses and currant bushes touched
each other  and where the feathery asparagus formed a pretty background
to the pinks and gilly flowers  there was no drive up to the door   we
got out at a little gate  and walked up a straight box edged path 

 my cousin might make a drive  i think   said miss pole  who was afraid
of ear ache  and had only her cap on 

 i think it is very pretty   said miss matty  with a soft plaintiveness
in her voice  and almost in a whisper  for just then mr holbrook
appeared at the door  rubbing his hands in very effervescence of
hospitality   he looked more like my idea of don quixote than ever  and
yet the likeness was only external   his respectable housekeeper stood
modestly at the door to bid us welcome  and  while she led the elder
ladies upstairs to a bedroom  i begged to look about the garden   my
request evidently pleased the old gentleman  who took me all round the
place and showed me his six and twenty cows  named after the different
letters of the alphabet  as we went along  he surprised me occasionally
by repeating apt and beautiful quotations from the poets  ranging easily
from shakespeare and george herbert to those of our own day   he did
this as naturally as if he were thinking aloud  and their true and
beautiful words were the best expression he could find for what he was
thinking or feeling   to be sure he called byron  my lord byrron   and
pronounced the name of goethe strictly in accordance with the english
sound of the letters  as goethe says   ye ever verdant palaces     c 
altogether  i never met with a man  before or since  who had spent so
long a life in a secluded and not impressive country  with
ever increasing delight in the daily and yearly change of season and
beauty 

when he and i went in  we found that dinner was nearly ready in the
kitchen for so i suppose the room ought to be called  as there were oak
dressers and cupboards all round  all over by the side of the fireplace 
and only a small turkey carpet in the middle of the flag floor   the
room might have been easily made into a handsome dark oak dining parlour
by removing the oven and a few other appurtenances of a kitchen  which
were evidently never used  the real cooking place being at some
distance   the room in which we were expected to sit was a
stiffly furnished  ugly apartment  but that in which we did sit was what
mr holbrook called the counting house  where he paid his labourers their
weekly wages at a great desk near the door   the rest of the pretty
sitting room looking into the orchard  and all covered over with dancing
tree shadows was filled with books   they lay on the ground  they
covered the walls  they strewed the table   he was evidently half
ashamed and half proud of his extravagance in this respect   they were
of all kinds poetry and wild weird tales prevailing   he evidently chose
his books in accordance with his own tastes  not because such and such
were classical or established favourites 

 ah   he said   we farmers ought not to have much time for reading  yet
somehow one can t help it  

 what a pretty room   said miss matty   sotto voce  

 what a pleasant place   said i  aloud  almost simultaneously 

 nay  if you like it   replied he   but can you sit on these great 
black leather  three cornered chairs   i like it better than the best
parlour  but i thought ladies would take that for the smarter place  

it was the smarter place  but  like most smart things  not at all
pretty  or pleasant  or home like  so  while we were at dinner  the
servant girl dusted and scrubbed the counting house chairs  and we sat
there all the rest of the day 

we had pudding before meat  and i thought mr holbrook was going to make
some apology for his old fashioned ways  for he began 

 i don t know whether you like newfangled ways  

 oh  not at all   said miss matty 

 no more do i   said he    my housekeeper  will  have these in her new
fashion  or else i tell her that  when i was a young man  we used to
keep strictly to my father s rule   no broth  no ball  no ball  no
beef   and always began dinner with broth   then we had suet puddings 
boiled in the broth with the beef  and then the meat itself   if we did
not sup our broth  we had no ball  which we liked a deal better  and the
beef came last of all  and only those had it who had done justice to the
broth and the ball   now folks begin with sweet things  and turn their
dinners topsy turvy  

when the ducks and green peas came  we looked at each other in dismay 
we had only two pronged  black handled forks   it is true the steel was
as bright as silver  but what were we to do   miss matty picked up her
peas  one by one  on the point of the prongs  much as amin  ate her
grains of rice after her previous feast with the ghoul   miss pole
sighed over her delicate young peas as she left them on one side of her
plate untasted  for they  would  drop between the prongs   i looked at
my host  the peas were going wholesale into his capacious mouth 
shovelled up by his large round ended knife   i saw  i imitated  i
survived   my friends  in spite of my precedent  could not muster up
courage enough to do an ungenteel thing  and  if mr holbrook had not
been so heartily hungry  he would probably have seen that the good peas
went away almost untouched 

after dinner  a clay pipe was brought in  and a spittoon  and  asking us
to retire to another room  where he would soon join us  if we disliked
tobacco smoke  he presented his pipe to miss matty  and requested her to
fill the bowl   this was a compliment to a lady in his youth  but it was
rather inappropriate to propose it as an honour to miss matty  who had
been trained by her sister to hold smoking of every kind in utter
abhorrence   but if it was a shock to her refinement  it was also a
gratification to her feelings to be thus selected  so she daintily
stuffed the strong tobacco into the pipe  and then we withdrew 

 it is very pleasant dining with a bachelor   said miss matty softly  as
we settled ourselves in the counting house    i only hope it is not
improper  so many pleasant things are  

 what a number of books he has   said miss pole  looking round the room 
 and how dusty they are  

 i think it must be like one of the great dr johnson s rooms   said miss
matty    what a superior man your cousin must be  

 yes   said miss pole   he s a great reader  but i am afraid he has got
into very uncouth habits with living alone  

 oh  uncouth is too hard a word   i should call him eccentric  very
clever people always are   replied miss matty 

             picture  now  what colour are ash buds in march 

when mr holbrook returned  he proposed a walk in the fields  but the two
elder ladies were afraid of damp  and dirt  and had only very unbecoming
calashes to put on over their caps  so they declined  and i was again
his companion in a turn which he said he was obliged to take to see
after his men   he strode along  either wholly forgetting my existence 
or soothed into silence by his pipe and yet it was not silence exactly 
he walked before me with a stooping gait  his hands clasped behind him 
and  as some tree or cloud  or glimpse of distant upland pastures 
struck him  he quoted poetry to himself  saying it out loud in a grand
sonorous voice  with just the emphasis that true feeling and
appreciation give   we came upon an old cedar tree  which stood at one
end of the house 

     the cedar spreads his dark green layers of shade  

 capital term  layers    wonderful man    i did not know whether he was
speaking to me or not  but i put in an assenting  wonderful   although i
knew nothing about it  just because i was tired of being forgotten  and
of being consequently silent 

he turned sharp round    ay  you may say  wonderful    why  when i saw
the review of his poems in  blackwood   i set off within an hour  and
walked seven miles to misselton  for the horses were not in the way  and
ordered them   now  what colour are ash buds in march  

is the man going mad  thought i   he is very like don quixote 

 what colour are they  i say   repeated he vehemently 

 i am sure i don t know  sir   said i  with the meekness of ignorance 

 i knew you didn t   no more did i an old fool that i am  till this
young man comes and tells me   black as ash buds in march   and i ve
lived all my life in the country  more shame for me not to know   black 
they are jet black  madam    and he went off again  swinging along to
the music of some rhyme he had got hold of 

when we came back  nothing would serve him but he must read us the poems
he had been speaking of  and miss pole encouraged him in his proposal  i
thought  because she wished me to hear his beautiful reading  of which
she had boasted  but she afterwards said it was because she had got to a
difficult part of her crochet  and wanted to count her stitches without
having to talk   whatever he had proposed would have been right to miss
matty  although she did fall sound asleep within five minutes after he
had begun a long poem  called  locksley hall   and had a comfortable
nap  unobserved  till he ended  when the cessation of his voice wakened
her up  and she said  feeling that something was expected  and that miss
pole was counting 

 what a pretty book  

 pretty  madam  it s beautiful   pretty  indeed  

 oh yes   i meant beautiful   said she  fluttered at his disapproval of
her word    it is so like that beautiful poem of dr johnson s my sister
used to read i forget the name of it  what was it  my dear   turning to
me 

 which do you mean  ma am   what was it about  

 i don t remember what it was about  and i ve quite forgotten what the
name of it was  but it was written by dr johnson  and was very
beautiful  and very like what mr holbrook has just been reading  

 i don t remember it   said he reflectively    but i don t know dr
johnson s poems well   i must read them  

as we were getting into the fly to return  i heard mr holbrook say he
should call on the ladies soon  and inquire how they got home  and this
evidently pleased and fluttered miss matty at the time he said it  but
after we had lost sight of the old house among the trees her sentiments
towards the master of it were gradually absorbed into a distressing
wonder as to whether martha had broken her word  and seized on the
opportunity of her mistress s absence to have a  follower    martha
looked good  and steady  and composed enough  as she came to help us
out  she was always careful of miss matty  and to night she made use of
this unlucky speech 

 eh  dear ma am  to think of your going out in an evening in such a thin
shawl   it s no better than muslin   at your age  ma am  you should be
careful  

 my age   said miss matty  almost speaking crossly  for her  for she was
usually gentle  my age   why  how old do you think i am  that you talk
about my age  

 well  ma am  i should say you were not far short of sixty  but folks 
looks is often against them and i m sure i meant no harm  

 martha  i m not yet fifty two   said miss matty  with grave emphasis 
for probably the remembrance of her youth had come very vividly before
her this day  and she was annoyed at finding that golden time so far
away in the past 

but she never spoke of any former and more intimate acquaintance with mr
holbrook   she had probably met with so little sympathy in her early
love  that she had shut it up close in her heart  and it was only by a
sort of watching  which i could hardly avoid since miss pole s
confidence  that i saw how faithful her poor heart had been in its
sorrow and its silence 

she gave me some good reason for wearing her best cap every day  and sat
near the window  in spite of her rheumatism  in order to see  without
being seen  down into the street 

he came   he put his open palms upon his knees  which were far apart  as
he sat with his head bent down  whistling  after we had replied to his
inquiries about our safe return   suddenly he jumped up 

 well  madam  have you any commands for paris   i am going there in a
week or two  

 to paris   we both exclaimed 

 yes  madam   i ve never been there  and always had a wish to go  and i
think if i don t go soon  i mayn t go at all  so as soon as the hay is
got in i shall go  before harvest time  

we were so much astonished that we had no commissions 

just as he was going out of the room  he turned back  with his favourite
exclamation 

 god bless my soul  madam  but i nearly forgot half my errand   here are
the poems for you you admired so much the other evening at my house  
he tugged away at a parcel in his coat pocket    good bye  miss   said
he   good bye  matty  take care of yourself    and he was gone   but he
had given her a book  and he had called her matty  just as he used to do
thirty years ago 

 i wish he would not go to paris   said miss matilda anxiously    i
don t believe frogs will agree with him  he used to have to be very
careful what he ate  which was curious in so strong looking a young
man  

soon after this i took my leave  giving many an injunction to martha to
look after her mistress  and to let me know if she thought that miss
matilda was not so well  in which case i would volunteer a visit to my
old friend  without noticing martha s intelligence to her 

accordingly i received a line or two from martha every now and then 
and  about november i had a note to say her mistress was  very low and
sadly off her food   and the account made me so uneasy that  although
martha did not decidedly summon me  i packed up my things and went 

i received a warm welcome  in spite of the little flurry produced by my
impromptu visit  for i had only been able to give a day s notice   miss
matilda looked miserably ill  and i prepared to comfort and cosset her 

i went down to have a private talk with martha 

 how long has your mistress been so poorly   i asked  as i stood by the
kitchen fire 

 well   i think it s better than a fortnight  it is  i know  it was one
tuesday  after miss pole had been  that she went into this moping way 
i thought she was tired  and it would go off with a night s rest  but
no  she has gone on and on ever since  till i thought it my duty to
write to you  ma am  

 you did quite right  martha   it is a comfort to think she has so
faithful a servant about her   and i hope you find your place
comfortable  

 well  ma am  missus is very kind  and there s plenty to eat and drink 
and no more work but what i can do easily but   martha hesitated 

 but what  martha  

 why  it seems so hard of missus not to let me have any followers 
there s such lots of young fellows in the town  and many a one has as
much as offered to keep company with me  and i may never be in such a
likely place again  and it s like wasting an opportunity   many a girl
as i know would have  em unbeknownst to missus  but i ve given my word 
and i ll stick to it  or else this is just the house for missus never to
be the wiser if they did come  and it s such a capable kitchen there s
such dark corners in it i d be bound to hide any one   i counted up last
sunday night for i ll not deny i was crying because i had to shut the
door in jem hearn s face  and he s a steady young man  fit for any girl 
only i had given missus my word    martha was all but crying again  and
i had little comfort to give her  for i knew  from old experience  of
the horror with which both the miss jenkynses looked upon  followers  
and in miss matty s present nervous state this dread was not likely to
be lessened 

i went to see miss pole the next day  and took her completely by
surprise  for she had not been to see miss matilda for two days 

 and now i must go back with you  my dear  for i promised to let her
know how thomas holbrook went on  and  i m sorry to say  his housekeeper
has sent me word to day that he hasn t long to live   poor thomas  that
journey to paris was quite too much for him   his housekeeper says he
has hardly ever been round his fields since  but just sits with his
hands on his knees in the counting house  not reading or anything  but
only saying what a wonderful city paris was   paris has much to answer
for if it s killed my cousin thomas  for a better man never lived  

 does miss matilda know of his illness   asked i a new light as to the
cause of her indisposition dawning upon me 

 dear  to be sure  yes   has not she told you   i let her know a
fortnight ago  or more  when first i heard of it   how odd she shouldn t
have told you  

not at all  i thought  but i did not say anything   i felt almost guilty
of having spied too curiously into that tender heart  and i was not
going to speak of its secrets hidden  miss matty believed  from all the
world  i ushered miss pole into miss matilda s little drawing room  and
then left them alone   but i was not surprised when martha came to my
bedroom door  to ask me to go down to dinner alone  for that missus had
one of her bad headaches   she came into the drawing room at tea time 
but it was evidently an effort to her  and  as if to make up for some
reproachful feeling against her late sister  miss jenkyns  which had
been troubling her all the afternoon  and for which she now felt
penitent  she kept telling me how good and how clever deborah was in her
youth  how she used to settle what gowns they were to wear at all the
parties  faint  ghostly ideas of grim parties  far away in the distance 
when miss matty and miss pole were young    and how deborah and her
mother had started the benefit society for the poor  and taught girls
cooking and plain sewing  and how deborah had once danced with a lord 
and how she used to visit at sir peter arley s  and tried to remodel the
quiet rectory establishment on the plans of arley hall  where they kept
thirty servants  and how she had nursed miss matty through a long  long
illness  of which i had never heard before  but which i now dated in my
own mind as following the dismissal of the suit of mr holbrook   so we
talked softly and quietly of old times through the long november
evening 

the next day miss pole brought us word that mr holbrook was dead   miss
matty heard the news in silence  in fact  from the account of the
previous day  it was only what we had to expect   miss pole kept calling
upon us for some expression of regret  by asking if it was not sad that
he was gone  and saying 

 to think of that pleasant day last june  when he seemed so well   and
he might have lived this dozen years if he had not gone to that wicked
paris  where they are always having revolutions  

she paused for some demonstration on our part   i saw miss matty could
not speak  she was trembling so nervously  so i said what i really felt 
and after a call of some duration all the time of which i have no doubt
miss pole thought miss matty received the news very calmly our visitor
took her leave 

miss matty made a strong effort to conceal her feelings a concealment
she practised even with me  for she has never alluded to mr holbrook
again  although the book he gave her lies with her bible on the little
table by her bedside   she did not think i heard her when she asked the
little milliner of cranford to make her caps something like the
honourable mrs jamieson s  or that i noticed the reply 

 but she wears widows  caps  ma am  

 oh   i only meant something in that style  not widows   of course  but
rather like mrs jamieson s  

this effort at concealment was the beginning of the tremulous motion of
head and hands which i have seen ever since in miss matty 

the evening of the day on which we heard of mr holbrook s death  miss
matilda was very silent and thoughtful  after prayers she called martha
back and then she stood uncertain what to say 

 martha   she said  at last   you are young  and then she made so long a
pause that martha  to remind her of her half finished sentence  dropped
a curtsey  and said 

 yes  please  ma am  two and twenty last third of october  please 
ma am  

 and  perhaps  martha  you may some time meet with a young man you like 
and who likes you   i did say you were not to have followers  but if
you meet with such a young man  and tell me  and i find he is
respectable  i have no objection to his coming to see you once a week 
god forbid   said she in a low voice   that i should grieve any young
hearts    she spoke as if she were providing for some distant
contingency  and was rather startled when martha made her ready eager
answer 

 please  ma am  there s jem hearn  and he s a joiner making
three and sixpence a day  and six foot one in his stocking feet  please 
ma am  and if you ll ask about him to morrow morning  every one will
give him a character for steadiness  and he ll be glad enough to come
to morrow night  i ll be bound  

though miss matty was startled  she submitted to fate and love 




chapter v 
old letters


i have often noticed that almost every one has his own individual small
economies careful habits of saving fractions of pennies in some one
peculiar direction any disturbance of which annoys him more than
spending shillings or pounds on some real extravagance   an old
gentleman of my acquaintance  who took the intelligence of the failure
of a joint stock bank  in which some of his money was invested  with
stoical mildness  worried his family all through a long summer s day
because one of them had torn  instead of cutting  out the written leaves
of his now useless bank book  of course  the corresponding pages at the
other end came out as well  and this little unnecessary waste of paper
 his private economy  chafed him more than all the loss of his money 
envelopes fretted his soul terribly when they first came in  the only
way in which he could reconcile himself to such waste of his cherished
article was by patiently turning inside out all that were sent to him 
and so making them serve again   even now  though tamed by age  i see
him casting wistful glances at his daughters when they send a whole
inside of a half sheet of note paper  with the three lines of acceptance
to an invitation  written on only one of the sides   i am not above
owning that i have this human weakness myself   string is my foible   my
pockets get full of little hanks of it  picked up and twisted together 
ready for uses that never come   i am seriously annoyed if any one cuts
the string of a parcel instead of patiently and faithfully undoing it
fold by fold   how people can bring themselves to use india rubber
rings  which are a sort of deification of string  as lightly as they do 
i cannot imagine   to me an india rubber ring is a precious treasure   i
have one which is not new one that i picked up off the floor nearly six
years ago   i have really tried to use it  but my heart failed me  and i
could not commit the extravagance 

small pieces of butter grieve others   they cannot attend to
conversation because of the annoyance occasioned by the habit which some
people have of invariably taking more butter than they want   have you
not seen the anxious look  almost mesmeric  which such persons fix on
the article  they would feel it a relief if they might bury it out of
their sight by popping it into their own mouths and swallowing it down 
and they are really made happy if the person on whose plate it lies
unused suddenly breaks off a piece of toast  which he does not want at
all  and eats up his butter   they think that this is not waste 

now miss matty jenkyns was chary of candles   we had many devices to use
as few as possible   in the winter afternoons she would sit knitting for
two or three hours she could do this in the dark  or by firelight and
when i asked if i might not ring for candles to finish stitching my
wristbands  she told me to  keep blind man s holiday    they were
usually brought in with tea  but we only burnt one at a time   as we
lived in constant preparation for a friend who might come in any evening
 but who never did   it required some contrivance to keep our two
candles of the same length  ready to be lighted  and to look as if we
burnt two always  the candles took it in turns  and  whatever we might
be talking about or doing  miss matty s eyes were habitually fixed upon
the candle  ready to jump up and extinguish it and to light the other
before they had become too uneven in length to be restored to equality
in the course of the evening 

one night  i remember this candle economy particularly annoyed me   i
had been very much tired of my compulsory  blind man s holiday  
especially as miss matty had fallen asleep  and i did not like to stir
the fire and run the risk of awakening her  so i could not even sit on
the rug  and scorch myself with sewing by firelight  according to my
usual custom   i fancied miss matty must be dreaming of her early life 
for she spoke one or two words in her uneasy sleep bearing reference to
persons who were dead long before   when martha brought in the lighted
candle and tea  miss matty started into wakefulness  with a strange 
bewildered look around  as if we were not the people she expected to see
about her  there was a little sad expression that shadowed her face as
she recognised me  but immediately afterwards she tried to give me her
usual smile   all through tea time her talk ran upon the days of her
childhood and youth   perhaps this reminded her of the desirableness of
looking over all the old family letters  and destroying such as ought
not to be allowed to fall into the hands of strangers  for she had often
spoken of the necessity of this task  but had always shrunk from it 
with a timid dread of something painful   to night  however  she rose up
after tea and went for them in the dark  for she piqued herself on the
precise neatness of all her chamber arrangements  and used to look
uneasily at me when i lighted a bed candle to go to another room for
anything   when she returned there was a faint  pleasant smell of
tonquin beans in the room  i had always noticed this scent about any of
the things which had belonged to her mother  and many of the letters
were addressed to her yellow bundles of love letters  sixty or seventy
years old 

miss matty undid the packet with a sigh  but she stifled it directly  as
if it were hardly right to regret the flight of time  or of life either 
we agreed to look them over separately  each taking a different letter
out of the same bundle and describing its contents to the other before
destroying it   i never knew what sad work the reading of old letters
was before that evening  though i could hardly tell why   the letters
were as happy as letters could be at least those early letters were 
there was in them a vivid and intense sense of the present time  which
seemed so strong and full  as if it could never pass away  and as if the
warm  living hearts that so expressed themselves could never die  and be
as nothing to the sunny earth   i should have felt less melancholy  i
believe  if the letters had been more so   i saw the tears stealing down
the well worn furrows of miss matty s cheeks  and her spectacles often
wanted wiping   i trusted at last that she would light the other candle 
for my own eyes were rather dim  and i wanted more light to see the
pale  faded ink  but no  even through her tears  she saw and remembered
her little economical ways 

the earliest set of letters were two bundles tied together  and ticketed
 in miss jenkyns s handwriting   letters interchanged between my
ever honoured father and my dearly beloved mother  prior to their
marriage  in july         i should guess that the rector of cranford was
about twenty seven years of age when he wrote those letters  and miss
matty told me that her mother was just eighteen at the time of her
wedding   with my idea of the rector derived from a picture in the
dining parlour  stiff and stately  in a huge full bottomed wig  with
gown  cassock  and bands  and his hand upon a copy of the only sermon he
ever published it was strange to read these letters   they were full of
eager  passionate ardour  short homely sentences  right fresh from the
heart  very different from the grand latinised  johnsonian style of the
printed sermon preached before some judge at assize time    his letters
were a curious contrast to those of his girl bride   she was evidently
rather annoyed at his demands upon her for expressions of love  and
could not quite understand what he meant by repeating the same thing
over in so many different ways  but what she was quite clear about was a
longing for a white  paduasoy  whatever that might be  and six or seven
letters were principally occupied in asking her lover to use his
influence with her parents  who evidently kept her in good order  to
obtain this or that article of dress  more especially the white
 paduasoy    he cared nothing how she was dressed  she was always lovely
enough for him  as he took pains to assure her  when she begged him to
express in his answers a predilection for particular pieces of finery 
in order that she might show what he said to her parents   but at length
he seemed to find out that she would not be married till she had a
 trousseau  to her mind  and then he sent her a letter  which had
evidently accompanied a whole box full of finery  and in which he
requested that she might be dressed in everything her heart desired 
this was the first letter  ticketed in a frail  delicate hand   from my
dearest john    shortly afterwards they were married  i suppose  from
the intermission in their correspondence 

 we must burn them  i think   said miss matty  looking doubtfully at me 
 no one will care for them when i am gone    and one by one she dropped
them into the middle of the fire  watching each blaze up  die out  and
rise away  in faint  white  ghostly semblance  up the chimney  before
she gave another to the same fate   the room was light enough now  but
i  like her  was fascinated into watching the destruction of those
letters  into which the honest warmth of a manly heart had been poured
forth 

the next letter  likewise docketed by miss jenkyns  was endorsed 
 letter of pious congratulation and exhortation from my venerable
grandfather to my beloved mother  on occasion of my own birth   also
some practical remarks on the desirability of keeping warm the
extremities of infants  from my excellent grandmother  

the first part was  indeed  a severe and forcible picture of the
responsibilities of mothers  and a warning against the evils that were
in the world  and lying in ghastly wait for the little baby of two days
old  his wife did not write  said the old gentleman  because he had
forbidden it  she being indisposed with a sprained ankle  which  he
said  quite incapacitated her from holding a pen   however  at the foot
of the page was a small  t o    and on turning it over  sure enough 
there was a letter to  my dear  dearest molly   begging her  when she
left her room  whatever she did  to go  up  stairs before going  down  
and telling her to wrap her baby s feet up in flannel  and keep it warm
by the fire  although it was summer  for babies were so tender 

it was pretty to see from the letters  which were evidently exchanged
with some frequency between the young mother and the grandmother  how
the girlish vanity was being weeded out of her heart by love for her
baby  the white  paduasoy  figured again in the letters  with almost as
much vigour as before   in one  it was being made into a christening
cloak for the baby   it decked it when it went with its parents to
spend a day or two at arley hall   it added to its charms  when it was
 the prettiest little baby that ever was seen   dear mother  i wish you
could see her  without any pershality  i do think she will grow up a
regular bewty    i thought of miss jenkyns  grey  withered  and
wrinkled  and i wondered if her mother had known her in the courts of
heaven  and then i knew that she had  and that they stood there in
angelic guise 

there was a great gap before any of the rector s letters appeared   and
then his wife had changed her mode of her endorsement   it was no longer
from   my dearest john   it was from  my honoured husband    the letters
were written on occasion of the publication of the same sermon which was
represented in the picture   the preaching before  my lord judge   and
the  publishing by request   was evidently the culminating point the
event of his life   it had been necessary for him to go up to london to
superintend it through the press   many friends had to be called upon
and consulted before he could decide on any printer fit for so onerous a
task  and at length it was arranged that j  and j  rivingtons were to
have the honourable responsibility   the worthy rector seemed to be
strung up by the occasion to a high literary pitch  for he could hardly
write a letter to his wife without cropping out into latin   i remember
the end of one of his letters ran thus   i shall ever hold the virtuous
qualities of my molly in remembrance   dum memor ipse mei    dum
spiritus regit artus    which  considering that the english of his
correspondent was sometimes at fault in grammar  and often in spelling 
might be taken as a proof of how much he  idealised his molly   and  as
miss jenkyns used to say   people talk a great deal about idealising
now a days  whatever that may mean    but this was nothing to a fit of
writing classical poetry which soon seized him  in which his molly
figured away as  maria    the letter containing the  carmen  was
endorsed by her   hebrew verses sent me by my honoured husband   i thowt
to have had a letter about killing the pig  but must wait   mem   to
send the poetry to sir peter arley  as my husband desires    and in a
post scriptum note in his handwriting it was stated that the ode had
appeared in the  gentleman s magazine   december      

her letters back to her husband  treasured as fondly by him as if they
had been  m  t  ciceronis epistol    were more satisfactory to an absent
husband and father than his could ever have been to her   she told him
how deborah sewed her seam very neatly every day  and read to her in the
books he had set her  how she was a very  forrard   good child  but
would ask questions her mother could not answer  but how she did not let
herself down by saying she did not know  but took to stirring the fire 
or sending the  forrard  child on an errand   matty was now the mother s
darling  and promised  like her sister at her age   to be a great
beauty  i was reading this aloud to miss matty  who smiled and sighed a
little at the hope  so fondly expressed  that  little matty might not be
vain  even if she were a bewty  

 i had very pretty hair  my dear   said miss matilda   and not a bad
mouth    and i saw her soon afterwards adjust her cap and draw herself
up 

but to return to mrs jenkyns s letters   she told her husband about the
poor in the parish  what homely domestic medicines she had administered 
what kitchen physic she had sent   she had evidently held his
displeasure as a rod in pickle over the heads of all the ne er do wells 
 she asked for his directions about the cows and pigs  and did not
always obtain them  as i have shown before 

the kind old grandmother was dead when a little boy was born  soon after
the publication of the sermon  but there was another letter of
exhortation from the grandfather  more stringent and admonitory than
ever  now that there was a boy to be guarded from the snares of the
world   he described all the various sins into which men might fall 
until i wondered how any man ever came to a natural death   the gallows
seemed as if it must have been the termination of the lives of most of
the grandfather s friends and acquaintance  and i was not surprised at
the way in which he spoke of this life being  a vale of tears  

it seemed curious that i should never have heard of this brother before 
but i concluded that he had died young  or else surely his name would
have been alluded to by his sisters 

by and by we came to packets of miss jenkyns s letters   these miss
matty did regret to burn   she said all the others had been only
interesting to those who loved the writers  and that it seemed as if it
would have hurt her to allow them to fall into the hands of strangers 
who had not known her dear mother  and how good she was  although she
did not always spell  quite in the modern fashion  but deborah s letters
were so very superior  any one might profit by reading them   it was a
long time since she had read mrs chapone  but she knew she used to think
that deborah could have said the same things quite as well  and as for
mrs carter  people thought a deal of her letters  just because she had
written  epictetus   but she was quite sure deborah would never have
made use of such a common expression as  i canna be fashed  

      picture  i made use of the time to think of many other things 

miss matty did grudge burning these letters  it was evident   she would
not let them be carelessly passed over with any quiet reading  and
skipping  to myself   she took them from me  and even lighted the second
candle in order to read them aloud with a proper emphasis  and without
stumbling over the big words   oh dear  how i wanted facts instead of
reflections  before those letters were concluded   they lasted us two
nights  and i won t deny that i made use of the time to think of many
other things  and yet i was always at my post at the end of each
sentence 

the rector s letters  and those of his wife and mother in law  had all
been tolerably short and pithy  written in a straight hand  with the
lines very close together   sometimes the whole letter was contained on
a mere scrap of paper   the paper was very yellow  and the ink very
brown  some of the sheets were  as miss matty made me observe  the old
original post  with the stamp in the corner representing a post boy
riding for life and twanging his horn   the letters of mrs jenkyns and
her mother were fastened with a great round red wafer  for it was before
miss edgeworth s  patronage  had banished wafers from polite society 
it was evident  from the tenor of what was said  that franks were in
great request  and were even used as a means of paying debts by needy
members of parliament   the rector sealed his epistles with an immense
coat of arms  and showed by the care with which he had performed this
ceremony that he expected they should be cut open  not broken by any
thoughtless or impatient hand   now  miss jenkyns s letters were of a
later date in form and writing   she wrote on the square sheet which we
have learned to call old fashioned   her hand was admirably calculated 
together with her use of many syllabled words  to fill up a sheet  and
then came the pride and delight of crossing   poor miss matty got sadly
puzzled with this  for the words gathered size like snowballs  and
towards the end of her letter miss jenkyns used to become quite
sesquipedalian   in one to her father  slightly theological and
controversial in its tone  she had spoken of herod  tetrarch of idumea 
miss matty read it  herod petrarch of etruria   and was just as well
pleased as if she had been right 

i can t quite remember the date  but i think it was in      that miss
jenkyns wrote the longest series of letters on occasion of her absence
on a visit to some friends near newcastle upon tyne   these friends were
intimate with the commandant of the garrison there  and heard from him
of all the preparations that were being made to repel the invasion of
buonaparte  which some people imagined might take place at the mouth of
the tyne   miss jenkyns was evidently very much alarmed  and the first
part of her letters was often written in pretty intelligible english 
conveying particulars of the preparations which were made in the family
with whom she was residing against the dreaded event  the bundles of
clothes that were packed up ready for a flight to alston moor  a wild
hilly piece of ground between northumberland and cumberland   the signal
that was to be given for this flight  and for the simultaneous turning
out of the volunteers under arms which said signal was to consist  if i
remember rightly  in ringing the church bells in a particular and
ominous manner   one day  when miss jenkyns and her hosts were at a
dinner party in newcastle  this warning summons was actually given  not
a very wise proceeding  if there be any truth in the moral attached to
the fable of the boy and the wolf  but so it was   and miss jenkyns 
hardly recovered from her fright  wrote the next day to describe the
sound  the breathless shock  the hurry and alarm  and then  taking
breath  she added   how trivial  my dear father  do all our
apprehensions of the last evening appear  at the present moment  to calm
and enquiring minds    and here miss matty broke in with 

 but  indeed  my dear  they were not at all trivial or trifling at the
time   i know i used to wake up in the night many a time and think i
heard the tramp of the french entering cranford   many people talked of
hiding themselves in the salt mines and meat would have kept capitally
down there  only perhaps we should have been thirsty   and my father
preached a whole set of sermons on the occasion  one set in the
mornings  all about david and goliath  to spirit up the people to
fighting with spades or bricks  if need were  and the other set in the
afternoons  proving that napoleon  that was another name for bony  as we
used to call him  was all the same as an apollyon and abaddon   i
remember my father rather thought he should be asked to print this last
set  but the parish had  perhaps  had enough of them with hearing  

peter marmaduke arley jenkyns   poor peter   as miss matty began to call
him  was at school at shrewsbury by this time   the rector took up his
pen  and rubbed up his latin once more  to correspond with his boy   it
was very clear that the lad s were what are called show letters   they
were of a highly mental description  giving an account of his studies 
and his intellectual hopes of various kinds  with an occasional
quotation from the classics  but  now and then  the animal nature broke
out in such a little sentence as this  evidently written in a trembling
hurry  after the letter had been inspected   mother dear  do send me a
cake  and put plenty of citron in    the  mother dear  probably answered
her boy in the form of cakes and  goody   for there were none of her
letters among this set  but a whole collection of the rector s  to whom
the latin in his boy s letters was like a trumpet to the old war horse 
i do not know much about latin  certainly  and it is  perhaps  an
ornamental language  but not very useful  i think at least to judge from
the bits i remember out of the rector s letters   one was   you have not
got that town in your map of ireland  but  bonus bernardus non videt
omnia   as the proverbia say    presently it became very evident that
 poor peter  got himself into many scrapes   there were letters of
stilted penitence to his father  for some wrong doing  and among them
all was a badly written  badly sealed  badly directed  blotted note   my
dear  dear  dear  dearest mother  i will be a better boy  i will 
indeed  but don t  please  be ill for me  i am not worth it  but i will
be good  darling mother  

miss matty could not speak for crying  after she had read this note 
she gave it to me in silence  and then got up and took it to her sacred
recesses in her own room  for fear  by any chance  it might get burnt 
 poor peter   she said   he was always in scrapes  he was too easy 
they led him wrong  and then left him in the lurch   but he was too fond
of mischief   he could never resist a joke   poor peter  




chapter vi 
poor peter


poor peter s career lay before him rather pleasantly mapped out by kind
friends  but  bonus bernardus non videt omnia   in this map too   he was
to win honours at the shrewsbury school  and carry them thick to
cambridge  and after that  a living awaited him  the gift of his
godfather  sir peter arley   poor peter  his lot in life was very
different to what his friends had hoped and planned   miss matty told me
all about it  and i think it was a relief when she had done so 

he was the darling of his mother  who seemed to dote on all her
children  though she was  perhaps  a little afraid of deborah s superior
acquirements   deborah was the favourite of her father  and when peter
disappointed him  she became his pride   the sole honour peter brought
away from shrewsbury was the reputation of being the best good fellow
that ever was  and of being the captain of the school in the art of
practical joking   his father was disappointed  but set about remedying
the matter in a manly way   he could not afford to send peter to read
with any tutor  but he could read with him himself  and miss matty told
me much of the awful preparations in the way of dictionaries and
lexicons that were made in her father s study the morning peter began 

 my poor mother   said she    i remember how she used to stand in the
hall  just near enough the study door  to catch the tone of my father s
voice   i could tell in a moment if all was going right  by her face 
and it did go right for a long time  

 what went wrong at last   said i    that tiresome latin  i dare say  

 no  it was not the latin   peter was in high favour with my father  for
he worked up well for him   but he seemed to think that the cranford
people might be joked about  and made fun of  and they did not like it 
nobody does   he was always hoaxing them   hoaxing  is not a pretty
word  my dear  and i hope you won t tell your father i used it  for i
should not like him to think that i was not choice in my language  after
living with such a woman as deborah   and be sure you never use it
yourself   i don t know how it slipped out of my mouth  except it was
that i was thinking of poor peter and it was always his expression   but
he was a very gentlemanly boy in many things   he was like dear captain
brown in always being ready to help any old person or a child   still 
he did like joking and making fun  and he seemed to think the old ladies
in cranford would believe anything   there were many old ladies living
here then  we are principally ladies now  i know  but we are not so old
as the ladies used to be when i was a girl   i could laugh to think of
some of peter s jokes   no  my dear  i won t tell you of them  because
they might not shock you as they ought to do  and they were very
shocking   he even took in my father once  by dressing himself up as a
lady that was passing through the town and wished to see the rector of
cranford   who had published that admirable assize sermon    peter said
he was awfully frightened himself when he saw how my father took it all
in  and even offered to copy out all his napoleon buonaparte sermons for
her him  i mean no  her  for peter was a lady then   he told me he was
more terrified than he ever was before  all the time my father was
speaking  he did not think my father would have believed him  and yet if
he had not  it would have been a sad thing for peter   as it was  he was
none so glad of it  for my father kept him hard at work copying out all
those twelve buonaparte sermons for the lady that was for peter himself 
you know   he was the lady   and once when he wanted to go fishing 
peter said   confound the woman   very bad language  my dear  but peter
was not always so guarded as he should have been  my father was so angry
with him  it nearly frightened me out of my wits  and yet i could hardly
keep from laughing at the little curtseys peter kept making  quite
slyly  whenever my father spoke of the lady s excellent taste and sound
discrimination  

                       picture  confound the woman 

 did miss jenkyns know of these tricks   said i 

 oh  no   deborah would have been too much shocked   no  no one knew but
me   i wish i had always known of peter s plans  but sometimes he did
not tell me   he used to say the old ladies in the town wanted something
to talk about  but i don t think they did   they had the  st james s
chronicle  three times a week  just as we have now  and we have plenty
to say  and i remember the clacking noise there always was when some of
the ladies got together   but  probably  schoolboys talk more than
ladies  at last there was a terrible  sad thing happened    miss matty
got up  went to the door  and opened it  no one was there   she rang the
bell for martha  and when martha came  her mistress told her to go for
eggs to a farm at the other end of the town 

 i will lock the door after you  martha   you are not afraid to go  are
you  

 no  ma am  not at all  jem hearn will be only too proud to go with me  

miss matty drew herself up  and as soon as we were alone  she wished
that martha had more maidenly reserve 

 we ll put out the candle  my dear   we can talk just as well by
firelight  you know   there   well  you see  deborah had gone from home
for a fortnight or so  it was a very still  quiet day  i remember 
overhead  and the lilacs were all in flower  so i suppose it was spring 
my father had gone out to see some sick people in the parish  i
recollect seeing him leave the house with his wig and shovel hat and
cane   what possessed our poor peter i don t know  he had the sweetest
temper  and yet he always seemed to like to plague deborah   she never
laughed at his jokes  and thought him ungenteel  and not careful enough
about improving his mind  and that vexed him 

 well  he went to her room  it seems  and dressed himself in her old
gown  and shawl  and bonnet  just the things she used to wear in
cranford  and was known by everywhere  and he made the pillow into a
little you are sure you locked the door  my dear  for i should not like
anyone to hear into into a little baby  with white long clothes   it was
only  as he told me afterwards  to make something to talk about in the
town  he never thought of it as affecting deborah   and he went and
walked up and down in the filbert walk just half hidden by the rails 
and half seen  and he cuddled his pillow  just like a baby  and talked
to it all the nonsense people do   oh dear  and my father came stepping
stately up the street  as he always did  and what should he see but a
little black crowd of people i daresay as many as twenty all peeping
through his garden rails   so he thought  at first  they were only
looking at a new rhododendron that was in full bloom  and that he was
very proud of  and he walked slower  that they might have more time to
admire   and he wondered if he could make out a sermon from the
occasion  and thought  perhaps  there was some relation between the
rhododendrons and the lilies of the field   my poor father   when he
came nearer  he began to wonder that they did not see him  but their
heads were all so close together  peeping and peeping   my father was
amongst them  meaning  he said  to ask them to walk into the garden with
him  and admire the beautiful vegetable production  when oh  my dear  i
tremble to think of it he looked through the rails himself  and saw i
don t know what he thought he saw  but old clare told me his face went
quite grey white with anger  and his eyes blazed out under his frowning
black brows  and he spoke out oh  so terribly  and bade them all stop
where they were not one of them to go  not one of them to stir a step 
and  swift as light  he was in at the garden door  and down the filbert
walk  and seized hold of poor peter  and tore his clothes off his
back bonnet  shawl  gown  and all and threw the pillow among the people
over the railings  and then he was very  very angry indeed  and before
all the people he lifted up his cane and flogged peter 

 my dear  that boy s trick  on that sunny day  when all seemed going
straight and well  broke my mother s heart  and changed my father for
life   it did  indeed   old clare said  peter looked as white as my
father  and stood as still as a statue to be flogged  and my father
struck hard   when my father stopped to take breath  peter said   have
you done enough  sir   quite hoarsely  and still standing quite quiet 
i don t know what my father said or if he said anything   but old clare
said  peter turned to where the people outside the railing were  and
made them a low bow  as grand and as grave as any gentleman  and then
walked slowly into the house   i was in the store room helping my mother
to make cowslip wine   i cannot abide the wine now  nor the scent of the
flowers  they turn me sick and faint  as they did that day  when peter
came in  looking as haughty as any man indeed  looking like a man  not
like a boy   mother   he said   i am come to say  god bless you for
ever    i saw his lips quiver as he spoke  and i think he durst not say
anything more loving  for the purpose that was in his heart   she
looked at him rather frightened  and wondering  and asked him what was
to do   he did not smile or speak  but put his arms round her and kissed
her as if he did not know how to leave off  and before she could speak
again  he was gone  we talked it over  and could not understand it  and
she bade me go and seek my father  and ask what it was all about   i
found him walking up and down  looking very highly displeased 

  tell your mother i have flogged peter  and that he richly deserved
it  

 i durst not ask any more questions   when i told my mother  she sat
down  quite faint  for a minute   i remember  a few days after  i saw
the poor  withered cowslip flowers thrown out to the leaf heap  to decay
and die there   there was no making of cowslip wine that year at the
rectory nor  indeed  ever after 

 presently my mother went to my father   i know i thought of queen
esther and king ahasuerus  for my mother was very pretty and
delicate looking  and my father looked as terrible as king ahasuerus 
some time after they came out together  and then my mother told me what
had happened  and that she was going up to peter s room at my father s
desire though she was not to tell peter this to talk the matter over
with him   but no peter was there   we looked over the house  no peter
was there   even my father  who had not liked to join in the search at
first  helped us before long  the rectory was a very old house steps up
into a room  steps down into a room  all through   at first  my mother
went calling low and soft  as if to reassure the poor boy   peter 
peter  dear  it s only me   but  by and by  as the servants came back
from the errands my father had sent them  in different directions  to
find where peter was as we found he was not in the garden  nor the
hayloft  nor anywhere about my mother s cry grew louder and wilder 
 peter   peter  my darling  where are you   for then she felt and
understood that that long kiss meant some sad kind of  good bye    the
afternoon went on my mother never resting  but seeking again and again
in every possible place that had been looked into twenty times before 
nay  that she had looked into over and over again herself  my father sat
with his head in his hands  not speaking except when his messengers came
in  bringing no tidings  then he lifted up his face  so strong and sad 
and told them to go again in some new direction   my mother kept passing
from room to room  in and out of the house  moving noiselessly  but
never ceasing   neither she nor my father durst leave the house  which
was the meeting place for all the messengers   at last  and it was
nearly dark   my father rose up   he took hold of my mother s arm as she
came with wild  sad pace through one door  and quickly towards another 
she started at the touch of his hand  for she had forgotten all in the
world but peter 

  molly   said he   i did not think all this would happen    he looked
into her face for comfort her poor face all wild and white  for neither
she nor my father had dared to acknowledge much less act upon the terror
that was in their hearts  lest peter should have made away with himself 
my father saw no conscious look in his wife s hot  dreary eyes  and he
missed the sympathy that she had always been ready to give him strong
man as he was  and at the dumb despair in her face his tears began to
flow  but when she saw this  a gentle sorrow came over her countenance 
and she said   dearest john  don t cry  come with me  and we ll find
him   almost as cheerfully as if she knew where he was   and she took my
father s great hand in her little soft one  and led him along  the tears
dropping as he walked on that same unceasing  weary walk  from room to
room  through house and garden 

 oh  how i wished for deborah   i had no time for crying  for now all
seemed to depend on me   i wrote for deborah to come home   i sent a
message privately to that same mr holbrook s house poor mr holbrook  you
know who i mean   i don t mean i sent a message to him  but i sent one
that i could trust to know if peter was at his house   for at one time
mr holbrook was an occasional visitor at the rectory you know he was
miss pole s cousin and he had been very kind to peter  and taught him
how to fish he was very kind to everybody  and i thought peter might
have gone off there   but mr holbrook was from home  and peter had never
been seen  it was night now  but the doors were all wide open  and my
father and mother walked on and on  it was more than an hour since he
had joined her  and i don t believe they had ever spoken all that time 
i was getting the parlour fire lighted  and one of the servants was
preparing tea  for i wanted them to have something to eat and drink and
warm them  when old clare asked to speak to me 

  i have borrowed the nets from the weir  miss matty   shall we drag the
ponds to night  or wait for the morning  

 i remember staring in his face to gather his meaning  and when i did  i
laughed out loud   the horror of that new thought our bright  darling
peter  cold  and stark  and dead   i remember the ring of my own laugh
now 

 the next day deborah was at home before i was myself again   she would
not have been so weak as to give way as i had done  but my screams  my
horrible laughter had ended in crying  had roused my sweet dear mother 
whose poor wandering wits were called back and collected as soon as a
child needed her care   she and deborah sat by my bedside  i knew by the
looks of each that there had been no news of peter no awful  ghastly
news  which was what i most had dreaded in my dull state between
sleeping and waking 

 the same result of all the searching had brought something of the same
relief to my mother  to whom  i am sure  the thought that peter might
even then be hanging dead in some of the familiar home places had caused
that never ending walk of yesterday   her soft eyes never were the same
again after that  they had always a restless  craving look  as if
seeking for what they could not find   oh  it was an awful time  coming
down like a thunder bolt on the still sunny day when the lilacs were all
in bloom  

 where was mr peter   said i 

 he had made his way to liverpool  and there was war then  and some of
the king s ships lay off the mouth of the mersey  and they were only too
glad to have a fine likely boy such as him  five foot nine he was   come
to offer himself   the captain wrote to my father  and peter wrote to my
mother   stay  those letters will be somewhere here  

we lighted the candle  and found the captain s letter and peter s too 
and we also found a little simple begging letter from mrs jenkyns to
peter  addressed to him at the house of an old schoolfellow whither she
fancied he might have gone   they had returned it unopened  and unopened
it had remained ever since  having been inadvertently put by among the
other letters of that time   this is it  

     my dearest peter  you did not think we should be so sorry as we
    are  i know  or you would never have gone away   you are too good 
    your father sits and sighs till my heart aches to hear him   he
    cannot hold up his head for grief  and yet he only did what he
    thought was right   perhaps he has been too severe  and perhaps
    i have not been kind enough  but god knows how we love you  my
    dear only boy   don looks so sorry you are gone   come back  and
    make us happy  who love you so much   i know you will come back  

but peter did not come back   that spring day was the last time he ever
saw his mother s face   the writer of the letter the last the only
person who had ever seen what was written in it  was dead long ago  and
i  a stranger  not born at the time when this occurrence took place  was
the one to open it 

the captain s letter summoned the father and mother to liverpool
instantly  if they wished to see their boy  and  by some of the wild
chances of life  the captain s letter had been detained somewhere 
somehow 

miss matty went on   and it was racetime  and all the post horses at
cranford were gone to the races  but my father and mother set off in our
own gig and oh  my dear  they were too late the ship was gone   and now
read peter s letter to my mother  

it was full of love  and sorrow  and pride in his new profession  and a
sore sense of his disgrace in the eyes of the people at cranford  but
ending with a passionate entreaty that she would come and see him before
he left the mersey   mother  we may go into battle   i hope we shall 
and lick those french  but i must see you again before that time  

 and she was too late   said miss matty   too late  

we sat in silence  pondering on the full meaning of those sad  sad
words  at length i asked miss matty to tell me how her mother bore it 

 oh   she said   she was patience itself   she had never been strong 
and this weakened her terribly   my father used to sit looking at her 
far more sad than she was   he seemed as if he could look at nothing
else when she was by  and he was so humble so very gentle now   he
would  perhaps  speak in his old way laying down the law  as it were and
then  in a minute or two  he would come round and put his hand on our
shoulders  and ask us in a low voice  if he had said anything to hurt
us  i did not wonder at his speaking so to deborah  for she was so
clever  but i could not bear to hear him talking so to me 

 but  you see  he saw what we did not that it was killing my mother 
yes  killing her  put out the candle  my dear  i can talk better in the
dark   for she was but a frail woman  and ill fitted to stand the fright
and shock she had gone through  and she would smile at him and comfort
him  not in words  but in her looks and tones  which were always
cheerful when he was there   and she would speak of how she thought
peter stood a good chance of being admiral very soon he was so brave and
clever  and how she thought of seeing him in his navy uniform  and what
sort of hats admirals wore  and how much more fit he was to be a sailor
than a clergyman  and all in that way  just to make my father think she
was quite glad of what came of that unlucky morning s work  and the
flogging which was always in his mind  as we all knew   but oh  my dear 
the bitter  bitter crying she had when she was alone  and at last  as
she grew weaker  she could not keep her tears in when deborah or me was
by  and would give us message after message for peter  his ship had gone
to the mediterranean  or somewhere down there  and then he was ordered
off to india  and there was no overland route then   but she still said
that no one knew where their death lay in wait  and that we were not to
think hers was near   we did not think it  but we knew it  as we saw her
fading away 

 well  my dear  it s very foolish of me  i know  when in all likelihood
i am so near seeing her again 

 and only think  love  the very day after her death for she did not live
quite a twelvemonth after peter went away the very day after came a
parcel for her from india from her poor boy   it was a large  soft 
white indian shawl  with just a little narrow border all round  just
what my mother would have liked 

 we thought it might rouse my father  for he had sat with her hand in
his all night long  so deborah took it in to him  and peter s letter to
her  and all   at first  he took no notice  and we tried to make a kind
of light careless talk about the shawl  opening it out and admiring it 
then  suddenly  he got up  and spoke   she shall be buried in it   he
said   peter shall have that comfort  and she would have liked it  

 well  perhaps it was not reasonable  but what could we do or say   one
gives people in grief their own way   he took it up and felt it   it is
just such a shawl as she wished for when she was married  and her mother
did not give it her   i did not know of it till after  or she should
have had it she should  but she shall have it now  

 my mother looked so lovely in her death   she was always pretty  and
now she looked fair  and waxen  and young younger than deborah  as she
stood trembling and shivering by her   we decked her in the long soft
folds  she lay smiling  as if pleased  and people came all cranford
came to beg to see her  for they had loved her dearly  as well they
might  and the countrywomen brought posies  old clare s wife brought
some white violets and begged they might lie on her breast 

 deborah said to me  the day of my mother s funeral  that if she had a
hundred offers she never would marry and leave my father   it was not
very likely she would have so many i don t know that she had one  but it
was not less to her credit to say so   she was such a daughter to my
father as i think there never was before or since   his eyes failed him 
and she read book after book  and wrote  and copied  and was always at
his service in any parish business   she could do many more things than
my poor mother could  she even once wrote a letter to the bishop for my
father   but he missed my mother sorely  the whole parish noticed it 
not that he was less active  i think he was more so  and more patient in
helping every one   i did all i could to set deborah at liberty to be
with him  for i knew i was good for little  and that my best work in the
world was to do odd jobs quietly  and set others at liberty   but my
father was a changed man  

 did mr peter ever come home  

 yes  once   he came home a lieutenant  he did not get to be admiral 
and he and my father were such friends   my father took him into every
house in the parish  he was so proud of him   he never walked out
without peter s arm to lean upon   deborah used to smile  i don t think
we ever laughed again after my mother s death   and say she was quite
put in a corner   not but what my father always wanted her when there
was letter writing or reading to be done  or anything to be settled  

 and then   said i  after a pause 

 then peter went to sea again  and  by and by  my father died  blessing
us both  and thanking deborah for all she had been to him  and  of
course  our circumstances were changed  and  instead of living at the
rectory  and keeping three maids and a man  we had to come to this small
house  and be content with a servant of all work  but  as deborah used
to say  we have always lived genteelly  even if circumstances have
compelled us to simplicity   poor deborah  

 and mr peter   asked i 

 oh  there was some great war in india i forget what they call it and we
have never heard of peter since then   i believe he is dead myself  and
it sometimes fidgets me that we have never put on mourning for him   and
then again  when i sit by myself  and all the house is still  i think i
hear his step coming up the street  and my heart begins to flutter and
beat  but the sound always goes past and peter never comes 

 that s martha back   no    i ll  go  my dear  i can always find my way
in the dark  you know   and a blow of fresh air at the door will do my
head good  and it s rather got a trick of aching  

so she pattered off   i had lighted the candle  to give the room a
cheerful appearance against her return 

 was it martha   asked i 

 yes   and i am rather uncomfortable  for i heard such a strange noise

chapter vii 
visiting


one morning  as miss matty and i sat at our work it was before twelve
o clock  and miss matty had not changed the cap with yellow ribbons that
had been miss jenkyns s best  and which miss matty was now wearing out
in private  putting on the one made in imitation of mrs jamieson s at
all times when she expected to be seen martha came up  and asked if miss
betty barker might speak to her mistress   miss matty assented  and
quickly disappeared to change the yellow ribbons  while miss barker came
upstairs  but  as she had forgotten her spectacles  and was rather
flurried by the unusual time of the visit  i was not surprised to see
her return with one cap on the top of the other   she was quite
unconscious of it herself  and looked at us  with bland satisfaction 
nor do i think miss barker perceived it  for  putting aside the little
circumstance that she was not so young as she had been  she was very
much absorbed in her errand  which she delivered herself of with an
oppressive modesty that found vent in endless apologies 

miss betty barker was the daughter of the old clerk at cranford who had
officiated in mr jenkyns s time   she and her sister had had pretty good
situations as ladies  maids  and had saved money enough to set up a
milliner s shop  which had been patronised by the ladies in the
neighbourhood   lady arley  for instance  would occasionally give miss
barkers the pattern of an old cap of hers  which they immediately copied
and circulated among the   lite  of cranford   i say the   lite   for
miss barkers had caught the trick of the place  and piqued themselves
upon their  aristocratic connection    they would not sell their caps
and ribbons to anyone without a pedigree   many a farmer s wife or
daughter turned away huffed from miss barkers  select millinery  and
went rather to the universal shop  where the profits of brown soap and
moist sugar enabled the proprietor to go straight to  paris  he said 
until he found his customers too patriotic and john bullish to wear what
the mounseers wore  london  where  as he often told his customers  queen
adelaide had appeared  only the very week before  in a cap exactly like
the one he showed them  trimmed with yellow and blue ribbons  and had
been complimented by king william on the becoming nature of her
head dress 

miss barkers  who confined themselves to truth  and did not approve of
miscellaneous customers  throve notwithstanding   they were
self denying  good people   many a time have i seen the eldest of them
 she that had been maid to mrs jamieson  carrying out some delicate mess
to a poor person   they only aped their betters in having  nothing to
do  with the class immediately below theirs   and when miss barker died 
their profits and income were found to be such that miss betty was
justified in shutting up shop and retiring from business   she also  as
i think i have before said  set up her cow  a mark of respectability in
cranford almost as decided as setting up a gig is among some people 
she dressed finer than any lady in cranford  and we did not wonder at
it  for it was understood that she was wearing out all the bonnets and
caps and outrageous ribbons which had once formed her stock in trade 
it was five or six years since she had given up shop  so in any other
place than cranford her dress might have been considered  pass e  

and now miss betty barker had called to invite miss matty to tea at her
house on the following tuesday   she gave me also an impromptu
invitation  as i happened to be a visitor though i could see she had a
little fear lest  since my father had gone to live in drumble  he might
have engaged in that  horrid cotton trade   and so dragged his family
down out of  aristocratic society    she prefaced this invitation with
so many apologies that she quite excited my curiosity    her
presumption  was to be excused   what had she been doing   she seemed so
overpowered by it i could only think that she had been writing to queen
adelaide to ask for a receipt for washing lace  but the act which she so
characterised was only an invitation she had carried to her sister s
former mistress  mrs jamieson    her former occupation considered  could
miss matty excuse the liberty    ah  thought i  she has found out that
double cap  and is going to rectify miss matty s head dress   no  it was
simply to extend her invitation to miss matty and to me   miss matty
bowed acceptance  and i wondered that  in the graceful action  she did
not feel the unusual weight and extraordinary height of her head dress 
but i do not think she did  for she recovered her balance  and went on
talking to miss betty in a kind  condescending manner  very different
from the fidgety way she would have had if she had suspected how
singular her appearance was    mrs jamieson is coming  i think you
said   asked miss matty 

 yes   mrs jamieson most kindly and condescendingly said she would be
happy to come   one little stipulation she made  that she should bring
carlo   i told her that if i had a weakness  it was for dogs  

 and miss pole   questioned miss matty  who was thinking of her pool at
preference  in which carlo would not be available as a partner 

 i am going to ask miss pole   of course  i could not think of asking
her until i had asked you  madam the rector s daughter  madam   believe
me  i do not forget the situation my father held under yours  

 and mrs forrester  of course  

 and mrs forrester   i thought  in fact  of going to her before i went
to miss pole   although her circumstances are changed  madam  she was
born at tyrrell  and we can never forget her alliance to the bigges  of
bigelow hall  

miss matty cared much more for the little circumstance of her being a
very good card player 

 mrs fitz adam i suppose  

 no  madam   i must draw a line somewhere   mrs jamieson would not  i
think  like to meet mrs fitz adam   i have the greatest respect for mrs
fitz adam but i cannot think her fit society for such ladies as mrs
jamieson and miss matilda jenkyns  

miss betty barker bowed low to miss matty  and pursed up her mouth   she
looked at me with sidelong dignity  as much as to say  although a
retired milliner  she was no democrat  and understood the difference of
ranks 

 may i beg you to come as near half past six to my little dwelling  as
possible  miss matilda   mrs jamieson dines at five  but has kindly
promised not to delay her visit beyond that time half past six    and
with a swimming curtsey miss betty barker took her leave 

my prophetic soul foretold a visit that afternoon from miss pole  who
usually came to call on miss matilda after any event or indeed in sight
of any event to talk it over with her 

 miss betty told me it was to be a choice and select few   said miss
pole  as she and miss matty compared notes 

 yes  so she said   not even mrs fitz adam  

now mrs fitz adam was the widowed sister of the cranford surgeon  whom i
have named before   their parents were respectable farmers  content with
their station   the name of these good people was hoggins   mr hoggins
was the cranford doctor now  we disliked the name and considered it
coarse  but  as miss jenkyns said  if he changed it to piggins it would
not be much better   we had hoped to discover a relationship between him
and that marchioness of exeter whose name was molly hoggins  but the
man  careless of his own interests  utterly ignored and denied any such
relationship  although  as dear miss jenkyns had said  he had a sister
called mary  and the same christian names were very apt to run in
families 

soon after miss mary hoggins married mr fitz adam  she disappeared from
the neighbourhood for many years   she did not move in a sphere in
cranford society sufficiently high to make any of us care to know what
mr fitz adam was   he died and was gathered to his fathers without our
ever having thought about him at all   and then mrs fitz adam reappeared
in cranford   as bold as a lion   miss pole said   a well to do widow 
dressed in rustling black silk  so soon after her husband s death that
poor miss jenkyns was justified in the remark she made  that  bombazine
would have shown a deeper sense of her loss  

i remember the convocation of ladies who assembled to decide whether or
not mrs fitz adam should be called upon by the old blue blooded
inhabitants of cranford   she had taken a large rambling house  which
had been usually considered to confer a patent of gentility upon its
tenant  because  once upon a time  seventy or eighty years before  the
spinster daughter of an earl had resided in it   i am not sure if the
inhabiting this house was not also believed to convey some unusual power
of intellect  for the earl s daughter  lady jane  had a sister  lady
anne  who had married a general officer in the time of the american war 
and this general officer had written one or two comedies  which were
still acted on the london boards  and which  when we saw them
advertised  made us all draw up  and feel that drury lane was paying a
very pretty compliment to cranford   still  it was not at all a settled
thing that mrs fitz adam was to be visited  when dear miss jenkyns died 
and  with her  something of the clear knowledge of the strict code of
gentility went out too   as miss pole observed   as most of the ladies
of good family in cranford were elderly spinsters  or widows without
children  if we did not relax a little  and become less exclusive 
by and by we should have no society at all  

mrs forrester continued on the same side 

 she had always understood that fitz meant something aristocratic  there
was fitz roy she thought that some of the king s children had been
called fitz roy  and there was fitz clarence  now they were the children
of dear good king william the fourth   fitz adam  it was a pretty name 
and she thought it very probably meant  child of adam    no one  who had
not some good blood in their veins  would dare to be called fitz  there
was a deal in a name she had had a cousin who spelt his name with two
little ffs ffoulkes and he always looked down upon capital letters and
said they belonged to lately invented families   she had been afraid he
would die a bachelor  he was so very choice   when he met with a mrs
ffarringdon  at a watering place  he took to her immediately  and a very
pretty genteel woman she was a widow  with a very good fortune  and  my
cousin   mr ffoulkes  married her  and it was all owing to her two
little ffs  

mrs fitz adam did not stand a chance of meeting with a mr fitz anything
in cranford  so that could not have been her motive for settling there 
miss matty thought it might have been the hope of being admitted into
the society of the place  which would certainly be a very agreeable rise
for  ci devant  miss hoggins  and if this had been her hope it would be
cruel to disappoint her 

so everybody called upon mrs fitz adam everybody but mrs jamieson  who
used to show how honourable she was by never seeing mrs fitz adam when
they met at the cranford parties   there would be only eight or ten
ladies in the room  and mrs fitz adam was the largest of all  and she
invariably used to stand up when mrs jamieson came in  and curtsey very
low to her whenever she turned in her direction so low  in fact  that i
think mrs jamieson must have looked at the wall above her  for she never
moved a muscle of her face  no more than if she had not seen her   still
mrs fitz adam persevered 

the spring evenings were getting bright and long when three or four
ladies in calashes met at miss barker s door   do you know what a
calash is   it is a covering worn over caps  not unlike the heads
fastened on old fashioned gigs  but sometimes it is not quite so large 
this kind of head gear always made an awful impression on the children
in cranford  and now two or three left off their play in the quiet
sunny little street  and gathered in wondering silence round miss pole 
miss matty  and myself   we were silent too  so that we could hear
loud  suppressed whispers inside miss barker s house   wait  peggy  wait
till i ve run upstairs and washed my hands   when i cough  open the
door  i ll not be a minute  

and  true enough it was not a minute before we heard a noise  between a
sneeze and a crow  on which the door flew open   behind it stood a
round eyed maiden  all aghast at the honourable company of calashes  who
marched in without a word   she recovered presence of mind enough to
usher us into a small room  which had been the shop  but was now
converted into a temporary dressing room   there we unpinned and shook
ourselves  and arranged our features before the glass into a sweet and
gracious company face  and then  bowing backwards with  after you 
ma am   we allowed mrs forrester to take precedence up the narrow
staircase that led to miss barker s drawing room   there she sat  as
stately and composed as though we had never heard that odd sounding
cough  from which her throat must have been even then sore and rough 
kind  gentle  shabbily dressed mrs forrester was immediately conducted
to the second place of honour a seat arranged something like prince
albert s near the queen s good  but not so good   the place of
pre eminence was  of course  reserved for the honourable mrs jamieson 
who presently came panting up the stairs carlo rushing round her on her
progress  as if he meant to trip her up 

and now miss betty barker was a proud and happy woman   she stirred the
fire  and shut the door  and sat as near to it as she could  quite on
the edge of her chair   when peggy came in  tottering under the weight
of the tea tray  i noticed that miss barker was sadly afraid lest peggy
should not keep her distance sufficiently   she and her mistress were on
very familiar terms in their every day intercourse  and peggy wanted now
to make several little confidences to her  which miss barker was on
thorns to hear  but which she thought it her duty  as a lady  to
repress   so she turned away from all peggy s asides and signs  but she
made one or two very malapropos answers to what was said  and at last 
seized with a bright idea  she exclaimed   poor  sweet carlo   i m
forgetting him  come downstairs with me  poor ittie doggie  and it shall
have its tea  it shall  

in a few minutes she returned  bland and benignant as before  but i
thought she had forgotten to give the  poor ittie doggie  anything to
eat  judging by the avidity with which he swallowed down chance pieces
of cake   the tea tray was abundantly loaded i was pleased to see it  i
was so hungry  but i was afraid the ladies present might think it
vulgarly heaped up   i know they would have done at their own houses 
but somehow the heaps disappeared here   i saw mrs jamieson eating
seed cake  slowly and considerately  as she did everything  and i was
rather surprised  for i knew she had told us  on the occasion of her
last party  that she never had it in her house  it reminded her so much
of scented soap   she always gave us savoy biscuits   however  mrs
jamieson was kindly indulgent to miss barker s want of knowledge of the
customs of high life  and  to spare her feelings  ate three large pieces
of seed cake  with a placid  ruminating expression of countenance  not
unlike a cow s 

after tea there was some little demur and difficulty   we were six in
number  four could play at preference  and for the other two there was
cribbage   but all  except myself  i was rather afraid of the cranford
ladies at cards  for it was the most earnest and serious business they
ever engaged in   were anxious to be of the  pool    even miss barker 
while declaring she did not know spadille from manille  was evidently
hankering to take a hand   the dilemma was soon put an end to by a
singular kind of noise   if a baron s daughter in law could ever be
supposed to snore  i should have said mrs jamieson did so then  for 
overcome by the heat of the room  and inclined to doze by nature  the
temptation of that very comfortable arm chair had been too much for her 
and mrs jamieson was nodding   once or twice she opened her eyes with an
effort  and calmly but unconsciously smiled upon us  but by and by  even
her benevolence was not equal to this exertion  and she was sound
asleep 

  picture  the temptation of the comfortable arm chair had been too much
                                 for her 

 it is very gratifying to me   whispered miss barker at the card table
to her three opponents  whom  notwithstanding her ignorance of the game 
she was  basting  most unmercifully  very gratifying indeed  to see how
completely mrs jamieson feels at home in my poor little dwelling  she
could not have paid me a greater compliment  

miss barker provided me with some literature in the shape of three or
four handsomely bound fashion books ten or twelve years old  observing 
as she put a little table and a candle for my especial benefit  that she
knew young people liked to look at pictures   carlo lay and snorted  and
started at his mistress s feet   he  too  was quite at home 

the card table was an animated scene to watch  four ladies  heads  with
niddle noddling caps  all nearly meeting over the middle of the table in
their eagerness to whisper quick enough and loud enough  and every now
and then came miss barker s  hush  ladies  if you please  hush   mrs
jamieson is asleep  

it was very difficult to steer clear between mrs forrester s deafness
and mrs jamieson s sleepiness   but miss barker managed her arduous task
well   she repeated the whisper to mrs forrester  distorting her face
considerably  in order to show  by the motions of her lips  what was
said  and then she smiled kindly all round at us  and murmured to
herself   very gratifying  indeed  i wish my poor sister had been alive
to see this day  

presently the door was thrown wide open  carlo started to his feet  with
a loud snapping bark  and mrs jamieson awoke  or  perhaps  she had not
been asleep as she said almost directly  the room had been so light she
had been glad to keep her eyes shut  but had been listening with great
interest to all our amusing and agreeable conversation   peggy came in
once more  red with importance   another tray    oh  gentility   thought
i   can you endure this last shock    for miss barker had ordered  nay 
i doubt not  prepared  although she did say   why  peggy  what have you
brought us   and looked pleasantly surprised at the unexpected pleasure 
all sorts of good things for supper scalloped oysters  potted lobsters 
jelly  a dish called  little cupids   which was in great favour with the
cranford ladies  although too expensive to be given  except on solemn
and state occasions macaroons sopped in brandy  i should have called it 
if i had not known its more refined and classical name    in short  we
were evidently to be feasted with all that was sweetest and best  and
we thought it better to submit graciously  even at the cost of our
gentility which never ate suppers in general  but which  like most
non supper eaters  was particularly hungry on all special occasions 

miss barker  in her former sphere  had  i daresay  been made acquainted
with the beverage they call cherry brandy   we none of us had ever seen
such a thing  and rather shrank back when she proffered it us  just a
little  leetle glass  ladies  after the oysters and lobsters  you know 
shell fish are sometimes thought not very wholesome    we all shook our
heads like female mandarins  but  at last  mrs jamieson suffered herself
to be persuaded  and we followed her lead   it was not exactly
unpalatable  though so hot and so strong that we thought ourselves bound
to give evidence that we were not accustomed to such things by coughing
terribly almost as strangely as miss barker had done  before we were
admitted by peggy 

 it s very strong   said miss pole  as she put down her empty glass   i
do believe there s spirit in it  

 only a little drop just necessary to make it keep   said miss barker 
 you know we put brandy pepper over our preserves to make them keep   i
often feel tipsy myself from eating damson tart  

i question whether damson tart would have opened mrs jamieson s heart as
the cherry brandy did  but she told us of a coming event  respecting
which she had been quite silent till that moment 

 my sister in law  lady glenmire  is coming to stay with me  

there was a chorus of  indeed   and then a pause   each one rapidly
reviewed her wardrobe  as to its fitness to appear in the presence of a
baron s widow  for  of course  a series of small festivals were always
held in cranford on the arrival of a visitor at any of our friends 
houses   we felt very pleasantly excited on the present occasion 

not long after this the maids and the lanterns were announced   mrs
jamieson had the sedan chair  which had squeezed itself into miss
barker s narrow lobby with some difficulty  and most literally  stopped
the way    it required some skilful manoeuvring on the part of the old
chairmen  shoemakers by day  but when summoned to carry the sedan
dressed up in a strange old livery long great coats  with small capes 
coeval with the sedan  and similar to the dress of the class in
hogarth s pictures  to edge  and back  and try at it again  and finally
to succeed in carrying their burden out of miss barker s front door 
then we heard their quick pit a pat along the quiet little street as we
put on our calashes and pinned up our gowns  miss barker hovering about
us with offers of help  which  if she had not remembered her former
occupation  and wished us to forget it  would have been much more
pressing 




chapter viii 
 your ladyship 


early the next morning directly after twelve miss pole made her
appearance at miss matty s   some very trifling piece of business was
alleged as a reason for the call  but there was evidently something
behind   at last out it came 

 by the way  you ll think i m strangely ignorant  but  do you really
know  i am puzzled how we ought to address lady glenmire   do you say 
 your ladyship   where you would say  you  to a common person   i have
been puzzling all morning  and are we to say  my lady   instead of
 ma am    now you knew lady arley will you kindly tell me the most
correct way of speaking to the peerage  

poor miss matty  she took off her spectacles and she put them on
again but how lady arley was addressed  she could not remember 

 it is so long ago   she said    dear  dear  how stupid i am   i don t
think i ever saw her more than twice   i know we used to call sir peter 
 sir peter  but he came much oftener to see us than lady arley did 
deborah would have known in a minute    my lady   your ladyship    it
sounds very strange  and as if it was not natural   i never thought of
it before  but  now you have named it  i am all in a puzzle  

it was very certain miss pole would obtain no wise decision from miss
matty  who got more bewildered every moment  and more perplexed as to
etiquettes of address 

 well  i really think   said miss pole   i had better just go and tell
mrs forrester about our little difficulty   one sometimes grows nervous 
and yet one would not have lady glenmire think we were quite ignorant of
the etiquettes of high life in cranford  

 and will you just step in here  dear miss pole  as you come back 
please  and tell me what you decide upon   whatever you and mrs
forrester fix upon  will be quite right  i m sure    lady arley    sir
peter    said miss matty to herself  trying to recall the old forms of
words 

 who is lady glenmire   asked i 

 oh  she s the widow of mr jamieson that s mrs jamieson s late husband 
you know widow of his eldest brother   mrs jamieson was a miss walker 
daughter of governor walker    your ladyship    my dear  if they fix on
that way of speaking  you must just let me practice a little on you
first  for i shall feel so foolish and hot saying it the first time to
lady glenmire  

it was really a relief to miss matty when mrs jamieson came on a very
unpolite errand   i notice that apathetic people have more quiet
impertinence than others  and mrs jamieson came now to insinuate pretty
plainly that she did not particularly wish that the cranford ladies
should call upon her sister in law   i can hardly say how she made this
clear  for i grew very indignant and warm  while with slow deliberation
she was explaining her wishes to miss matty  who  a true lady herself 
could hardly understand the feeling which made mrs jamieson wish to
appear to her noble sister in law as if she only visited  county 
families   miss matty remained puzzled and perplexed long after i had
found out the object of mrs jamieson s visit 

when she did understand the drift of the honourable lady s call  it was
pretty to see with what quiet dignity she received the intimation thus
uncourteously given   she was not in the least hurt she was of too
gentle a spirit for that  nor was she exactly conscious of disapproving
of mrs jamieson s conduct  but there was something of this feeling in
her mind  i am sure  which made her pass from the subject to others in a
less flurried and more composed manner than usual   mrs jamieson was 
indeed  the more flurried of the two  and i could see she was glad to
take her leave 

a little while afterwards miss pole returned  red and indignant    well 
to be sure   you ve had mrs jamieson here  i find from martha  and we
are not to call on lady glenmire   yes   i met mrs jamieson  half way
between here and mrs forrester s  and she told me  she took me so by
surprise  i had nothing to say   i wish i had thought of something very
sharp and sarcastic  i dare say i shall to night   and lady glenmire is
but the widow of a scotch baron after all   i went on to look at mrs
forrester s peerage  to see who this lady was  that is to be kept under
a glass case  widow of a scotch peer never sat in the house of lords and
as poor as job  i dare say  and she fifth daughter of some mr campbell
or other  you are the daughter of a rector  at any rate  and related to
the arleys  and sir peter might have been viscount arley  every one
says  

miss matty tried to soothe miss pole  but in vain   that lady  usually
so kind and good humoured  was now in a full flow of anger 

 and i went and ordered a cap this morning  to be quite ready   said she
at last  letting out the secret which gave sting to mrs jamieson s
intimation    mrs jamieson shall see if it is so easy to get me to make
fourth at a pool when she has none of her fine scotch relations with
her  

in coming out of church  the first sunday on which lady glenmire
appeared in cranford  we sedulously talked together  and turned our
backs on mrs jamieson and her guest   if we might not call on her  we
would not even look at her  though we were dying with curiosity to know
what she was like   we had the comfort of questioning martha in the
afternoon   martha did not belong to a sphere of society whose
observation could be an implied compliment to lady glenmire  and martha
had made good use of her eyes 

 well  ma am  is it the little lady with mrs jamieson  you mean   i
thought you would like more to know how young mrs smith was dressed  her
being a bride     mrs smith was the butcher s wife  

miss pole said   good gracious me  as if we cared about a mrs smith  
but was silent as martha resumed her speech 

 the little lady in mrs jamieson s pew had on  ma am  rather an old
black silk  and a shepherd s plaid cloak  ma am  and very bright black
eyes she had  ma am  and a pleasant  sharp face  not over young  ma am 
but yet  i should guess  younger than mrs jamieson herself   she looked
up and down the church  like a bird  and nipped up her petticoats  when
she came out  as quick and sharp as ever i see   i ll tell you what 
ma am  she s more like mrs deacon  at the  coach and horses   nor any
one  

 hush  martha   said miss matty   that s not respectful  

 isn t it  ma am   i beg pardon  i m sure  but jem hearn said so as
well  he said  she was just such a sharp  stirring sort of a body  

 lady   said miss pole 

 lady as mrs deacon  

another sunday passed away  and we still averted our eyes from mrs
jamieson and her guest  and made remarks to ourselves that we thought
were very severe almost too much so   miss matty was evidently uneasy at
our sarcastic manner of speaking 

perhaps by this time lady glenmire had found out that mrs jamieson s was
not the gayest  liveliest house in the world  perhaps mrs jamieson had
found out that most of the county families were in london  and that
those who remained in the country were not so alive as they might have
been to the circumstance of lady glenmire being in their neighbourhood 
great events spring out of small causes  so i will not pretend to say
what induced mrs jamieson to alter her determination of excluding the
cranford ladies  and send notes of invitation all round for a small
party on the following tuesday   mr mulliner himself brought them round 
 he  would  always ignore the fact of there being a back door to any
house  and gave a louder rat tat than his mistress  mrs jamieson   he
had three little notes  which he carried in a large basket  in order to
impress his mistress with an idea of their great weight  though they
might easily have gone into his waistcoat pocket 

miss matty and i quietly decided that we would have a previous
engagement at home  it was the evening on which miss matty usually made
candle lighters of all the notes and letters of the week  for on mondays
her accounts were always made straight not a penny owing from the week
before  so  by a natural arrangement  making candle lighters fell upon a
tuesday evening  and gave us a legitimate excuse for declining mrs
jamieson s invitation   but before our answer was written  in came miss
pole  with an open note in her hand 

 so   she said    ah   i see you have got your note  too   better late
than never   i could have told my lady glenmire she would be glad enough
of our society before a fortnight was over  

 yes   said miss matty   we re asked for tuesday evening   and perhaps
you would just kindly bring your work across and drink tea with us that
night   it is my usual regular time for looking over the last week s
bills  and notes  and letters  and making candle lighters of them  but
that does not seem quite reason enough for saying i have a previous
engagement at home  though i meant to make it do   now  if you would
come  my conscience would be quite at ease  and luckily the note is not
written yet  

i saw miss pole s countenance change while miss matty was speaking 

 don t you mean to go then   asked she 

 oh  no   said  miss matty quietly    you don t either  i suppose  

 i don t know   replied miss pole    yes  i think i do   said she 
rather briskly  and on seeing miss matty look surprised  she added   you
see  one would not like mrs jamieson to think that anything she could
do  or say  was of consequence enough to give offence  it would be a
kind of letting down of ourselves  that i  for one  should not like   it
would be too flattering to mrs jamieson if we allowed her to suppose
that what she had said affected us a week  nay ten days afterwards  

 well   i suppose it is wrong to be hurt and annoyed so long about
anything  and  perhaps  after all  she did not mean to vex us   but i
must say  i could not have brought myself to say the things mrs jamieson
did about our not calling   i really don t think i shall go  

 oh  come   miss matty  you must go  you know our friend mrs jamieson is
much more phlegmatic than most people  and does not enter into the
little delicacies of feeling which you possess in so remarkable a
degree  

 i thought you possessed them  too  that day mrs jamieson called to tell
us not to go   said miss matty innocently 

but miss pole  in addition to her delicacies of feeling  possessed a
very smart cap  which she was anxious to show to an admiring world  and
so she seemed to forget all her angry words uttered not a fortnight
before  and to be ready to act on what she called the great christian
principle of  forgive and forget   and she lectured dear miss matty so
long on this head that she absolutely ended by assuring her it was her
duty  as a deceased rector s daughter  to buy a new cap and go to the
party at mrs jamieson s   so  we were most happy to accept   instead of
 regretting that we were obliged to decline  

                           picture  mr mulliner 

the expenditure on dress in cranford was principally in that one article
referred to   if the heads were buried in smart new caps  the ladies
were like ostriches  and cared not what became of their bodies   old
gowns  white and venerable collars  any number of brooches  up and down
and everywhere  some with dogs  eyes painted in them  some that were
like small picture frames with mausoleums and weeping willows neatly
executed in hair inside  some  again  with miniatures of ladies and
gentlemen sweetly smiling out of a nest of stiff muslin   old brooches
for a permanent ornament  and new caps to suit the fashion of the
day the ladies of cranford always dressed with chaste elegance and
propriety  as miss barker once prettily expressed it 

and with three new caps  and a greater array of brooches than had ever
been seen together at one time since cranford was a town  did mrs
forrester  and miss matty  and miss pole appear on that memorable
tuesday evening   i counted seven brooches myself on miss pole s dress 
two were fixed negligently in her cap  one was a butterfly made of
scotch pebbles  which a vivid imagination might believe to be the real
insect   one fastened her net neckerchief  one her collar  one
ornamented the front of her gown  midway between her throat and waist 
and another adorned the point of her stomacher   where the seventh was i
have forgotten  but it was somewhere about her  i am sure 

but i am getting on too fast  in describing the dresses of the company 
i should first relate the gathering on the way to mrs jamieson s   that
lady lived in a large house just outside the town   a road which had
known what it was to be a street ran right before the house  which
opened out upon it without any intervening garden or court   whatever
the sun was about  he never shone on the front of that house   to be
sure  the living rooms were at the back  looking on to a pleasant
garden  the front windows only belonged to kitchens and housekeepers 
rooms  and pantries  and in one of them mr mulliner was reported to sit 
 indeed  looking askance  we often saw the back of a head covered with
hair powder  which also extended itself over his coat collar down to his
very waist  and this imposing back was always engaged in reading the  st
james s chronicle   opened wide  which  in some degree  accounted for
the length of time the said newspaper was in reaching us equal
subscribers with mrs jamieson  though  in right of her honourableness 
she always had the reading of it first   this very tuesday  the delay in
forwarding the last number had been particularly aggravating  just when
both miss pole and miss matty  the former more especially  had been
wanting to see it  in order to coach up the court news ready for the
evening s interview with aristocracy   miss pole told us she had
absolutely taken time by the forelock  and been dressed by five o clock 
in order to be ready if the  st james s chronicle  should come in at the
last moment the very  st james s chronicle  which the powdered head was
tranquilly and composedly reading as we passed the accustomed window
this evening 

 the impudence of the man   said miss pole  in a low indignant whisper 
 i should like to ask him whether his mistress pays her quarter share
for his exclusive use  

we looked at her in admiration of the courage of her thought  for mr
mulliner was an object of great awe to all of us   he seemed never to
have forgotten his condescension in coming to live at cranford   miss
jenkyns  at times  had stood forth as the undaunted champion of her sex 
and spoken to him on terms of equality  but even miss jenkyns could get
no higher   in his pleasantest and most gracious moods he looked like a
sulky cockatoo   he did not speak except in gruff monosyllables   he
would wait in the hall when we begged him not to wait  and then look
deeply offended because we had kept him there  while  with trembling 
hasty hands we prepared ourselves for appearing in company 

miss pole ventured on a small joke as we went upstairs  intended  though
addressed to us  to afford mr mulliner some slight amusement   we all
smiled  in order to seem as if we felt at our ease  and timidly looked
for mr mulliner s sympathy   not a muscle of that wooden face had
relaxed  and we were grave in an instant 

mrs jamieson s drawing room was cheerful  the evening sun came streaming
into it  and the large square window was clustered round with flowers 
the furniture was white and gold  not the later style  louis quatorze  i
think they call it  all shells and twirls  no  mrs jamieson s chairs and
tables had not a curve or bend about them   the chair and table legs
diminished as they neared the ground  and were straight and square in
all their corners   the chairs were all a row against the walls  with
the exception of four or five which stood in a circle round the fire 
they were railed with white bars across the back and knobbed with gold 
neither the railings nor the knobs invited to ease   there was a
japanned table devoted to literature  on which lay a bible  a peerage 
and a prayer book   there was another square pembroke table dedicated to
the fine arts  on which were a kaleidoscope  conversation cards 
puzzle cards  tied together to an interminable length with faded pink
satin ribbon   and a box painted in fond imitation of the drawings which
decorate tea chests   carlo lay on the worsted worked rug  and
ungraciously barked at us as we entered   mrs jamieson stood up  giving
us each a torpid smile of welcome  and looking helplessly beyond us at
mr mulliner  as if she hoped he would place us in chairs  for  if he did
not  she never could   i suppose he thought we could find our way to the
circle round the fire  which reminded me of stonehenge  i don t know
why   lady glenmire came to the rescue of our hostess  and  somehow or
other  we found ourselves for the first time placed agreeably  and not
formally  in mrs jamieson s house   lady glenmire  now we had time to
look at her  proved to be a bright little woman of middle age  who had
been very pretty in the days of her youth  and who was even yet very
pleasant looking   i saw miss pole appraising her dress in the first
five minutes  and i take her word when she said the next day 

 my dear  ten pounds would have purchased every stitch she had on lace
and all  

it was pleasant to suspect that a peeress could be poor  and partly
reconciled us to the fact that her husband had never sat in the house of
lords  which  when we first heard of it  seemed a kind of swindling us
out of our prospects on false pretences  a sort of  a lord and no lord 
business 

we were all very silent at first   we were thinking what we could talk
about  that should be high enough to interest my lady   there had been a
rise in the price of sugar  which  as preserving time was near  was a
piece of intelligence to all our house keeping hearts  and would have
been the natural topic if lady glenmire had not been by   but we were
not sure if the peerage ate preserves much less knew how they were made 
 at last  miss pole  who had always a great deal of courage and  savoir
faire   spoke to lady glenmire  who on her part had seemed just as much
puzzled to know how to break the silence as we were 

 has your ladyship been to court lately   asked she  and then gave a
little glance round at us  half timid and half triumphant  as much as to
say   see how judiciously i have chosen a subject befitting the rank of
the stranger  

 i never was there in my life   said lady glenmire  with a broad scotch
accent  but in a very sweet voice   and then  as if she had been too
abrupt  she added   we very seldom went to london only twice  in fact 
during all my married life  and before i was married my father had far
too large a family   fifth daughter of mr campbell was in all our minds 
i am sure   to take us often from our home  even to edinburgh   ye ll
have been in edinburgh  maybe   said she  suddenly brightening up with
the hope of a common interest   we had none of us been there  but miss
pole had an uncle who once had passed a night there  which was very
pleasant 

mrs jamieson  meanwhile  was absorbed in wonder why mr mulliner did not
bring the tea  and at length the wonder oozed out of her mouth 

 i had better ring the bell  my dear  had not i   said lady glenmire
briskly 

 no i think not mulliner does not like to be hurried  

we should have liked our tea  for we dined at an earlier hour than mrs
jamieson   i suspect mr mulliner had to finish the  st james s
chronicle  before he chose to trouble himself about tea   his mistress
fidgeted and fidgeted  and kept saying   i can t think why mulliner does
not bring tea   i can t think what he can be about    and lady glenmire
at last grew quite impatient  but it was a pretty kind of impatience
after all  and she rang the bell rather sharply  on receiving a
half permission from her sister in law to do so   mr mulliner appeared
in dignified surprise   oh   said mrs jamieson   lady glenmire rang the
bell  i believe it was for tea  

in a few minutes tea was brought   very delicate was the china  very old
the plate  very thin the bread and butter  and very small the lumps of
sugar   sugar was evidently mrs jamieson s favourite economy   i
question if the little filigree sugar tongs  made something like
scissors  could have opened themselves wide enough to take up an honest 
vulgar good sized piece  and when i tried to seize two little minnikin
pieces at once  so as not to be detected in too many returns to the
sugar basin  they absolutely dropped one  with a little sharp clatter 
quite in a malicious and unnatural manner   but before this happened we
had had a slight disappointment   in the little silver jug was cream  in
the larger one was milk   as soon as mr mulliner came in  carlo began to
beg  which was a thing our manners forbade us to do  though i am sure we
were just as hungry  and mrs jamieson said she was certain we would
excuse her if she gave her poor dumb carlo his tea first   she
accordingly mixed a saucerful for him  and put it down for him to lap 
and then she told us how intelligent and sensible the dear little fellow
was  he knew cream quite well  and constantly refused tea with only milk
in it  so the milk was left for us  but we silently thought we were
quite as intelligent and sensible as carlo  and felt as if insult were
added to injury when we were called upon to admire the gratitude evinced
by his wagging his tail for the cream which should have been ours 

after tea we thawed down into common life subjects   we were thankful to
lady glenmire for having proposed some more bread and butter  and this
mutual want made us better acquainted with her than we should ever have
been with talking about the court  though miss pole did say she had
hoped to know how the dear queen was from some one who had seen her 

the friendship begun over bread and butter extended on to cards   lady
glenmire played preference to admiration  and was a complete authority
as to ombre and quadrille   even miss pole quite forgot to say  my
lady   and  your ladyship   and said  basto  ma am    you have spadille 
i believe   just as quietly as if we had never held the great cranford
parliament on the subject of the proper mode of addressing a peeress 

as a proof of how thoroughly we had forgotten that we were in the
presence of one who might have sat down to tea with a coronet  instead
of a cap  on her head  mrs forrester related a curious little fact to
lady glenmire an anecdote known to the circle of her intimate friends 
but of which even mrs jamieson was not aware   it related to some fine
old lace  the sole relic of better days  which lady glenmire was
admiring on mrs forrester s collar 

 yes   said that lady   such lace cannot be got now for either love or
money  made by the nuns abroad  they tell me   they say that they can t
make it now even there   but perhaps they can  now they ve passed the
catholic emancipation bill   i should not wonder   but  in the meantime 
i treasure up my lace very much   i daren t even trust the washing of it
to my maid   the little charity school girl i have named before  but who
sounded well as  my maid      i always wash it myself   and once it had
a narrow escape   of course  your ladyship knows that such lace must
never be starched or ironed   some people wash it in sugar and water 
and some in coffee  to make it the right yellow colour  but i myself
have a very good receipt for washing it in milk  which stiffens it
enough  and gives it a very good creamy colour   well  ma am  i had
tacked it together  and the beauty of this fine lace is that  when it is
wet  it goes into a very little space   and put it to soak in milk 
when  unfortunately  i left the room  on my return  i found pussy on the
table  looking very like a thief  but gulping very uncomfortably  as if
she was half chocked with something she wanted to swallow and could not 
 and  would you believe it   at first i pitied her  and said  poor
pussy  poor pussy   till  all at once  i looked and saw the cup of milk
empty cleaned out    you naughty cat   said i  and i believe i was
provoked enough to give her a slap  which did no good  but only helped
the lace down just as one slaps a choking child on the back   i could
have cried  i was so vexed  but i determined i would not give the lace
up without a struggle for it   i hoped the lace might disagree with her 
at any rate  but it would have been too much for job  if he had seen  as
i did  that cat come in  quite placid and purring  not a quarter of an
hour after  and almost expecting to be stroked    no  pussy   said i 
 if you have any conscience you ought not to expect that    and then a
thought struck me  and i rang the bell for my maid  and sent her to mr
hoggins  with my compliments  and would he be kind enough to lend me one
of his top boots for an hour   i did not think there was anything odd in
the message  but jenny said the young men in the surgery laughed as if
they would be ill at my wanting a top boot   when it came  jenny and i
put pussy in  with her forefeet straight down  so that they were
fastened  and could not scratch  and we gave her a teaspoonful of
current jelly in which  your ladyship must excuse me  i had mixed some
tartar emetic   i shall never forget how anxious i was for the next
half hour   i took pussy to my own room  and spread a clean towel on the
floor   i could have kissed her when she returned the lace to sight 
very much as it had gone down   jenny had boiling water ready  and we
soaked it and soaked it  and spread it on a lavender bush in the sun
before i could touch it again  even to put it in milk   but now your
ladyship would never guess that it had been in pussy s inside  

           picture  we gave her a teaspoonful of current jelly 

we found out  in the course of the evening  that lady glenmire was going
to pay mrs jamieson a long visit  as she had given up her apartments in
edinburgh  and had no ties to take her back there in a hurry   on the
whole  we were rather glad to hear this  for she had made a pleasant
impression upon us  and it was also very comfortable to find  from
things which dropped out in the course of conversation  that  in
addition to many other genteel qualities  she was far removed from the
 vulgarity of wealth  

 don t you find it very unpleasant walking   asked mrs jamieson  as our
respective servants were announced   it was a pretty regular question
from mrs jamieson  who had her own carriage in the coach house  and
always went out in a sedan chair to the very shortest distances   the
answers were nearly as much a matter of course 

 oh dear  no  it is so pleasant and still at night     such a
refreshment after the excitement of a party     the stars are so
beautiful    this last was from miss matty 

 are you fond of astronomy   lady glenmire asked 

 not very   replied miss matty  rather confused at the moment to
remember which was astronomy and which was astrology but the answer was
true under either circumstance  for she read  and was slightly alarmed
at francis moore s astrological predictions  and  as to astronomy  in a
private and confidential conversation  she had told me she never could
believe that the earth was moving constantly  and that she would not
believe it if she could  it made her feel so tired and dizzy whenever
she thought about it 

in our pattens we picked our way home with extra care that night  so
refined and delicate were our perceptions after drinking tea with  my
lady  




chapter ix 
signor brunoni


soon after the events of which i gave an account in my last paper  i was
summoned home by my father s illness  and for a time i forgot  in
anxiety about him  to wonder how my dear friends at cranford were
getting on  or how lady glenmire could reconcile herself to the dulness
of the long visit which she was still paying to her sister in law  mrs
jamieson  when my father grew a little stronger i accompanied him to the
seaside  so that altogether i seemed banished from cranford  and was
deprived of the opportunity of hearing any chance intelligence of the
dear little town for the greater part of that year 

late in november when we had returned home again  and my father was once
more in good health i received a letter from miss matty  and a very
mysterious letter it was   she began many sentences without ending them 
running them one into another  in much the same confused sort of way in
which written words run together on blotting paper   all i could make
out was that  if my father was better  which she hoped he was   and
would take warning and wear a great coat from michaelmas to lady day  if
turbans were in fashion  could i tell her   such a piece of gaiety was
going to happen as had not been seen or known of since wombwell s lions
came  when one of them ate a little child s arm  and she was  perhaps 
too old to care about dress  but a new cap she must have  and  having
heard that turbans were worn  and some of the county families likely to
come  she would like to look tidy  if i would bring her a cap from the
milliner i employed  and oh  dear  how careless of her to forget that
she wrote to beg i would come and pay her a visit next tuesday  when she
hoped to have something to offer me in the way of amusement  which she
would not now more particularly describe  only sea green was her
favourite colour   so she ended her letter  but in a p s  she added  she
thought she might as well tell me what was the peculiar attraction to
cranford just now  signor brunoni was going to exhibit his wonderful
magic in the cranford assembly rooms on wednesday and friday evening in
the following week 

i was very glad to accept the invitation from my dear miss matty 
independently of the conjuror  and most particularly anxious to prevent
her from disfiguring her small  gentle  mousey face with a great
saracen s head turban  and accordingly  i bought her a pretty  neat 
middle aged cap  which  however  was rather a disappointment to her
when  on my arrival  she followed me into my bedroom  ostensibly to poke
the fire  but in reality  i do believe  to see if the sea green turban
was not inside the cap box with which i had travelled   it was in vain
that i twirled the cap round on my hand to exhibit back and side fronts 
her heart had been set upon a turban  and all she could do was to say 
with resignation in her look and voice 

 i am sure you did your best  my dear   it is just like the caps all the
ladies in cranford are wearing  and they have had theirs for a year  i
dare say   i should have liked something newer  i confess something more
like the turbans miss betty barker tells me queen adelaide wears  but it
is very pretty  my dear   and i dare say lavender will wear better than
sea green   well  after all  what is dress  that we should care anything
about it   you ll tell me if you want anything  my dear   here is the
bell   i suppose turbans have not got down to drumble yet  

so saying  the dear old lady gently bemoaned herself out of the room 
leaving me to dress for the evening  when  as she informed me  she
expected miss pole and mrs forrester  and she hoped i should not feel
myself too much tired to join the party   of course i should not  and i
made some haste to unpack and arrange my dress  but  with all my speed 
i heard the arrivals and the buzz of conversation in the next room
before i was ready   just as i opened the door  i caught the words   i
was foolish to expect anything very genteel out of the drumble shops 
poor girl  she did her best  i ve no doubt    but  for all that  i had
rather that she blamed drumble and me than disfigured herself with a
turban 

miss pole was always the person  in the trio of cranford ladies now
assembled  to have had adventures   she was in the habit of spending the
morning in rambling from shop to shop  not to purchase anything  except
an occasional reel of cotton or a piece of tape   but to see the new
articles and report upon them  and to collect all the stray pieces of
intelligence in the town   she had a way  too  of demurely popping
hither and thither into all sorts of places to gratify her curiosity on
any point a way which  if she had not looked so very genteel and prim 
might have been considered impertinent   and now  by the expressive way
in which she cleared her throat  and waited for all minor subjects  such
as caps and turbans  to be cleared off the course  we knew she had
something very particular to relate  when the due pause came and i defy
any people possessed of common modesty to keep up a conversation long 
where one among them sits up aloft in silence  looking down upon all the
things they chance to say as trivial and contemptible compared to what
they could disclose  if properly entreated   miss pole began 

 as i was stepping out of gordon s shop to day  i chanced to go into the
 george   my betty has a second cousin who is chambermaid there  and i
thought betty would like to hear how she was   and  not seeing anyone
about  i strolled up the staircase  and found myself in the passage
leading to the assembly room  you and i remember the assembly room  i am
sure  miss matty  and the minuets de la cour    so i went on  not
thinking of what i was about  when  all at once  i perceived that i was
in the middle of the preparations for to morrow night the room being
divided with great clothes maids  over which crosby s men were tacking
red flannel  very dark and odd it seemed  it quite bewildered me  and i
was going on behind the screens  in my absence of mind  when a
gentleman  quite the gentleman  i can assure you  stepped forwards and
asked if i had any business he could arrange for me   he spoke such
pretty broken english  i could not help thinking of thaddeus of warsaw 
and the hungarian brothers  and santo sebastiani  and while i was busy
picturing his past life to myself  he had bowed me out of the room   but
wait a minute   you have not heard half my story yet   i was going
downstairs  when who should i meet but betty s second cousin   so  of
course  i stopped to speak to her for betty s sake  and she told me that
i had really seen the conjuror the gentleman who spoke broken english
was signor brunoni himself   just at this moment he passed us on the
stairs  making such a graceful bow  in reply to which i dropped a
curtsey all foreigners have such polite manners  one catches something
of it   but when he had gone downstairs  i bethought me that i had
dropped my glove in the assembly room  it was safe in my muff all the
time  but i never found it till afterwards   so i went back  and  just
as i was creeping up the passage left on one side of the great screen
that goes nearly across the room  who should i see but the very same
gentleman that had met me before  and passed me on the stairs  coming
now forwards from the inner part of the room  to which there is no
entrance you remember  miss matty and just repeating  in his pretty
broken english  the inquiry if i had any business there i don t mean
that he put it quite so bluntly  but he seemed very determined that i
should not pass the screen so  of course  i explained about my glove 
which  curiously enough  i found at that very moment  

miss pole  then  had seen the conjuror the real  live conjuror  and
numerous were the questions we all asked her    had he a beard     was
he young  or old     fair  or dark     did he look   unable to shape my
question prudently  i put it in another form   how did he look    in
short  miss pole was the heroine of the evening  owing to her morning s
encounter   if she was not the rose  that is to say the conjuror  she
had been near it 

conjuration  sleight of hand  magic  witchcraft  were the subjects of
the evening   miss pole was slightly sceptical  and inclined to think
there might be a scientific solution found for even the proceedings of
the witch of endor   mrs forrester believed everything  from ghosts to
death watches   miss matty ranged between the two always convinced by
the last speaker   i think she was naturally more inclined to mrs
forrester s side  but a desire of proving herself a worthy sister to
miss jenkyns kept her equally balanced miss jenkyns  who would never
allow a servant to call the little rolls of tallow that formed
themselves round candles  winding sheets   but insisted on their being
spoken of as  roley poleys    a sister of hers to be superstitious   it
would never do 

after tea  i was despatched downstairs into the dining parlour for that
volume of the old encyclop dia which contained the nouns beginning with
c  in order that miss pole might prime herself with scientific
explanations for the tricks of the following evening   it spoilt the
pool at preference which miss matty and mrs forrester had been looking
forward to  for miss pole became so much absorbed in her subject  and
the plates by which it was illustrated  that we felt it would be cruel
to disturb her otherwise than by one or two well timed yawns  which i
threw in now and then  for i was really touched by the meek way in which
the two ladies were bearing their disappointment   but miss pole only
read the more zealously  imparting to us no more information than this 

 ah  i see  i comprehend perfectly   a represents the ball   put a
between b and d no  between c and f  and turn the second joint of the
third finger of your left hand over the wrist of your right h   very
clear indeed   my dear mrs forrester  conjuring and witchcraft is a mere
affair of the alphabet   do let me read you this one passage  

mrs forrester implored miss pole to spare her  saying  from a child
upwards  she never could understand being read aloud to  and i dropped
the pack of cards  which i had been shuffling very audibly  and by this
discreet movement i obliged miss pole to perceive that preference was to
have been the order of the evening  and to propose  rather unwillingly 
that the pool should commence   the pleasant brightness that stole over
the other two ladies  faces on this   miss matty had one or two twinges
of self reproach for having interrupted miss pole in her studies  and
did not remember her cards well  or give her full attention to the game 
until she had soothed her conscience by offering to lend the volume of
the encyclop dia to miss pole  who accepted it thankfully  and said
betty should take it home when she came with the lantern 

the next evening we were all in a little gentle flutter at the idea of
the gaiety before us   miss matty went up to dress betimes  and hurried
me until i was ready  when we found we had an hour and a half to wait
before the  doors opened at seven precisely    and we had only twenty
yards to go   however  as miss matty said  it would not do to get too
much absorbed in anything  and forget the time  so she thought we had
better sit quietly  without lighting the candles  till five minutes to
seven   so miss matty dozed  and i knitted 

at length we set off  and at the door under the carriage way at the
 george   we met mrs forrester and miss pole  the latter was discussing
the subject of the evening with more vehemence than ever  and throwing
x s and b s at our heads like hailstones   she had even copied one or
two of the  receipts  as she called them for the different tricks  on
backs of letters  ready to explain and to detect signor brunoni s arts 

we went into the cloak room adjoining the assembly room  miss matty gave
a sigh or two to her departed youth  and the remembrance of the last
time she had been there  as she adjusted her pretty new cap before the
strange  quaint old mirror in the cloak room   the assembly room had
been added to the inn  about a hundred years before  by the different
county families  who met together there once a month during the winter
to dance and play at cards   many a county beauty had first swung
through the minuet that she afterwards danced before queen charlotte in
this very room   it was said that one of the gunnings had graced the
apartment with her beauty  it was certain that a rich and beautiful
widow  lady williams  had here been smitten with the noble figure of a
young artist  who was staying with some family in the neighbourhood for
professional purposes  and accompanied his patrons to the cranford
assembly   and a pretty bargain poor lady williams had of her handsome
husband  if all tales were true   now  no beauty blushed and dimpled
along the sides of the cranford assembly room  no handsome artist won
hearts by his bow   chapeau bras  in hand  the old room was dingy  the
salmon coloured paint had faded into a drab  great pieces of plaster had
chipped off from the fine wreaths and festoons on its walls  but still a
mouldy odour of aristocracy lingered about the place  and a dusty
recollection of the days that were gone made miss matty and mrs
forrester bridle up as they entered  and walk mincingly up the room  as
if there were a number of genteel observers  instead of two little boys
with a stick of toffee between them with which to beguile the time 

we stopped short at the second front row  i could hardly understand why 
until i heard miss pole ask a stray waiter if any of the county families
were expected  and when he shook his head  and believed not  mrs
forrester and miss matty moved forwards  and our party represented a
conversational square   the front row was soon augmented and enriched by
lady glenmire and mrs jamieson   we six occupied the two front rows  and
our aristocratic seclusion was respected by the groups of shopkeepers
who strayed in from time to time and huddled together on the back
benches   at least i conjectured so  from the noise they made  and the
sonorous bumps they gave in sitting down  but when  in weariness of the
obstinate green curtain that would not draw up  but would stare at me
with two odd eyes  seen through holes  as in the old tapestry story  i
would fain have looked round at the merry chattering people behind me 
miss pole clutched my arm  and begged me not to turn  for  it was not
the thing    what  the thing  was  i never could find out  but it must
have been something eminently dull and tiresome   however  we all sat
eyes right  square front  gazing at the tantalising curtain  and hardly
speaking intelligibly  we were so afraid of being caught in the
vulgarity of making any noise in a place of public amusement   mrs
jamieson was the most fortunate  for she fell asleep 

at length the eyes disappeared the curtain quivered one side went up
before the other  which stuck fast  it was dropped again  and  with a
fresh effort  and a vigorous pull from some unseen hand  it flew up 
revealing to our sight a magnificent gentleman in the turkish costume 
seated before a little table  gazing at us  i should have said with the
same eyes that i had last seen through the hole in the curtain  with
calm and condescending dignity   like a being of another sphere   as i
heard a sentimental voice ejaculate behind me 

 that s not signor brunoni   said miss pole decidedly  and so audibly
that i am sure he heard  for he glanced down over his flowing beard at
our party with an air of mute reproach    signor brunoni had no
beard but perhaps he ll come soon    so she lulled herself into
patience  meanwhile  miss matty had reconnoitred through her eye glass 
wiped it  and looked again   then she turned round  and said to me  in a
kind  mild  sorrowful tone 

 you see  my dear  turbans  are  worn  

but we had no time for more conversation   the grand turk  as miss pole
chose to call him  arose and announced himself as signor brunoni 

 i don t believe him   exclaimed miss pole  in a defiant manner   he
looked at her again  with the same dignified upbraiding in his
countenance    i don t   she repeated more positively than ever 
 signor brunoni had not got that muffy sort of thing about his chin  but
looked like a close shaved christian gentleman  

miss pole s energetic speeches had the good effect of wakening up mrs
jamieson  who opened her eyes wide  in sign of the deepest attention a
proceeding which silenced miss pole and encouraged the grand turk to
proceed  which he did in very broken english so broken that there was no
cohesion between the parts of his sentences  a fact which he himself
perceived at last  and so left off speaking and proceeded to action 

now we  were  astonished   how he did his tricks i could not imagine 
no  not even when miss pole pulled out her pieces of paper and began
reading aloud or at least in a very audible whisper the separate
 receipts  for the most common of his tricks   if ever i saw a man frown
and look enraged  i saw the grand turk frown at miss pole  but  as she
said  what could be expected but unchristian looks from a mussulman   if
miss pole were sceptical  and more engrossed with her receipts and
diagrams than with his tricks  miss matty and mrs forrester were
mystified and perplexed to the highest degree   mrs jamieson kept taking
her spectacles off and wiping them  as if she thought it was something
defective in them which made the legerdemain  and lady glenmire  who had
seen many curious sights in edinburgh  was very much struck with the
tricks  and would not at all agree with miss pole  who declared that
anybody could do them with a little practice  and that she would 
herself  undertake to do all he did  with two hours given to study the
encyclop dia and make her third finger flexible 

at last miss matty and mrs forrester became perfectly awestricken   they
whispered together   i sat just behind them  so i could not help hearing
what they were saying   miss matty asked mrs forrester  if she thought
it was quite right to have come to see such things   she could not help
fearing they were lending encouragement to something that was not
quite   a little shake of the head filled up the blank   mrs forrester
replied  that the same thought had crossed her mind  she too was feeling
very uncomfortable  it was so very strange   she was quite certain that
it was her pocket handkerchief which was in that loaf just now  and it
had been in her own hand not five minutes before   she wondered who had
furnished the bread   she was sure it could not be dakin  because he was
the churchwarden   suddenly miss matty half turned towards me 

 will you look  my dear you are a stranger in the town  and it won t
give rise to unpleasant reports will you just look round and see if the
rector is here   if he is  i think we may conclude that this wonderful
man is sanctioned by the church  and that will be a great relief to my
mind  

i looked  and i saw the tall  thin  dry  dusty rector  sitting
surrounded by national school boys  guarded by troops of his own sex
from any approach of the many cranford spinsters   his kind face was all
agape with broad smiles  and the boys around him were in chinks of
laughing   i told miss matty that the church was smiling approval  which
set her mind at ease 

                  picture  afraid of matrimonial reports 

i have never named mr hayter  the rector  because i  as a well to do and
happy young woman  never came in contact with him   he was an old
bachelor  but as afraid of matrimonial reports getting abroad about him
as any girl of eighteen  and he would rush into a shop or dive down an
entry  sooner than encounter any of the cranford ladies in the street 
and  as for the preference parties  i did not wonder at his not
accepting invitations to them   to tell the truth  i always suspected
miss pole of having given very vigorous chase to mr hayter when he first
came to cranford  and not the less  because now she appeared to share so
vividly in his dread lest her name should ever be coupled with his   he
found all his interests among the poor and helpless  he had treated the
national school boys this very night to the performance  and virtue was
for once its own reward  for they guarded him right and left  and clung
round him as if he had been the queen bee and they the swarm   he felt
so safe in their environment that he could even afford to give our party
a bow as we filed out   miss pole ignored his presence  and pretended to
be absorbed in convincing us that we had been cheated  and had not seen
signor brunoni after all 




chapter x 
the panic


i think a series of circumstances dated from signor brunoni s visit to
cranford  which seemed at the time connected in our minds with him 
though i don t know that he had anything really to do with them   all at
once all sorts of uncomfortable rumours got afloat in the town   there
were one or two robberies real  bon  fide  robberies  men had up before
the magistrates and committed for trial and that seemed to make us all
afraid of being robbed  and for a long time  at miss matty s  i know  we
used to make a regular expedition all round the kitchens and cellars
every night  miss matty leading the way  armed with the poker  i
following with the hearth brush  and martha carrying the shovel and
fire irons with which to sound the alarm  and by the accidental hitting
together of them she often frightened us so much that we bolted
ourselves up  all three together  in the back kitchen  or store room  or
wherever we happened to be  till  when our affright was over  we
recollected ourselves and set out afresh with double valiance   by day
we heard strange stories from the shopkeepers and cottagers  of carts
that went about in the dead of night  drawn by horses shod with felt 
and guarded by men in dark clothes  going round the town  no doubt in
search of some unwatched house or some unfastened door 

miss pole  who affected great bravery herself  was the principal person
to collect and arrange these reports so as to make them assume their
most fearful aspect   but we discovered that she had begged one of mr
hoggins s worn out hats to hang up in her lobby  and we  at least i  had
doubts as to whether she really would enjoy the little adventure of
having her house broken into  as she protested she should   miss matty
made no secret of being an arrant coward  but she went regularly through
her housekeeper s duty of inspection only the hour for this became
earlier and earlier  till at last we went the rounds at half past six 
and miss matty adjourned to bed soon after seven   in order to get the
night over the sooner  

cranford had so long piqued itself on being an honest and moral town
that it had grown to fancy itself too genteel and well bred to be
otherwise  and felt the stain upon its character at this time doubly 
but we comforted ourselves with the assurance which we gave to each
other that the robberies could never have been committed by any cranford
person  it must have been a stranger or strangers who brought this
disgrace upon the town  and occasioned as many precautions as if we were
living among the red indians or the french 

this last comparison of our nightly state of defence and fortification
was made by mrs forrester  whose father had served under general
burgoyne in the american war  and whose husband had fought the french in
spain  she indeed inclined to the idea that  in some way  the french
were connected with the small thefts  which were ascertained facts  and
the burglaries and highway robberies  which were rumours   she had been
deeply impressed with the idea of french spies at some time in her life 
and the notion could never be fairly eradicated  but sprang up again
from time to time   and now her theory was this  the cranford people
respected themselves too much  and were too grateful to the aristocracy
who were so kind as to live near the town  ever to disgrace their
bringing up by being dishonest or immoral  therefore  we must believe
that the robbers were strangers if strangers  why not foreigners  if
foreigners  who so likely as the french   signor brunoni spoke broken
english like a frenchman  and  though he wore a turban like a turk  mrs
forrester had seen a print of madame de sta l with a turban on  and
another of mr denon in just such a dress as that in which the conjuror
had made his appearance  showing clearly that the french  as well as the
turks  wore turbans   there could be no doubt signor brunoni was a
frenchman a french spy come to discover the weak and undefended places
of england  and doubtless he had his accomplices   for her part  she 
mrs forrester  had always had her own opinion of miss pole s adventure
at the  george inn  seeing two men where only one was believed to be 
french people had ways and means which  she was thankful to say  the
english knew nothing about  and she had never felt quite easy in her
mind about going to see that conjuror it was rather too much like a
forbidden thing  though the rector was there   in short  mrs forrester
grew more excited than we had ever known her before  and  being an
officer s daughter and widow  we looked up to her opinion  of course 

really i do not know how much was true or false in the reports which
flew about like wildfire just at this time  but it seemed to me then
that there was every reason to believe that at mardon  a small town
about eight miles from cranford  houses and shops were entered by holes
made in the walls  the bricks being silently carried away in the dead of
the night  and all done so quietly that no sound was heard either in or
out of the house   miss matty gave it up in despair when she heard of
this   what was the use   said she   of locks and bolts  and bells to
the windows  and going round the house every night   that last trick was
fit for a conjuror   now she did believe that signor brunoni was at the
bottom of it  

one afternoon  about five o clock  we were startled by a hasty knock at
the door   miss matty bade me run and tell martha on no account to open
the door till she  miss matty  had reconnoitred through the window  and
she armed herself with a footstool to drop down on the head of the
visitor  in case he should show a face covered with black crape  as he
looked up in answer to her inquiry of who was there   but it was nobody
but miss pole and betty   the former came upstairs  carrying a little
hand basket  and she was evidently in a state of great agitation 

 take care of that   said she to me  as i offered to relieve her of her
basket    it s my plate   i am sure there is a plan to rob my house
to night   i am come to throw myself on your hospitality  miss matty 
betty is going to sleep with her cousin at the  george    i can sit up
here all night if you will allow me  but my house is so far from any
neighbours  and i don t believe we could be heard if we screamed ever
so  

 but   said miss matty   what has alarmed you so much   have you seen
any men lurking about the house  

 oh  yes   answered miss pole    two very bad looking men have gone
three times past the house  very slowly  and an irish beggar woman came
not half an hour ago  and all but forced herself in past betty  saying
her children were starving  and she must speak to the mistress   you
see  she said  mistress   though there was a hat hanging up in the hall 
and it would have been more natural to have said  master    but betty
shut the door in her face  and came up to me  and we got the spoons
together  and sat in the parlour window watching till we saw thomas
jones going from his work  when we called to him and asked him to take
care of us into the town  

we might have triumphed over miss pole  who had professed such bravery
until she was frightened  but we were too glad to perceive that she
shared in the weaknesses of humanity to exult over her  and i gave up my
room to her very willingly  and shared miss matty s bed for the night 
but before we retired  the two ladies rummaged up  out of the recesses
of their memory  such horrid stories of robbery and murder that i quite
quaked in my shoes   miss pole was evidently anxious to prove that such
terrible events had occurred within her experience that she was
justified in her sudden panic  and miss matty did not like to be
outdone  and capped every story with one yet more horrible  till it
reminded me oddly enough  of an old story i had read somewhere  of a
nightingale and a musician  who strove one against the other which could
produce the most admirable music  till poor philomel dropped down dead 

one of the stories that haunted me for a long time afterwards was of a
girl who was left in charge of a great house in cumberland on some
particular fair day  when the other servants all went off to the
gaieties   the family were away in london  and a pedlar came by  and
asked to leave his large and heavy pack in the kitchen  saying he would
call for it again at night  and the girl  a gamekeeper s daughter  
roaming about in search of amusement  chanced to hit upon a gun hanging
up in the hall  and took it down to look at the chasing  and it went off
through the open kitchen door  hit the pack  and a slow dark thread of
blood came oozing out   how miss pole enjoyed this part of the story 
dwelling on each word as if she loved it    she rather hurried over the
further account of the girl s bravery  and i have but a confused idea
that  somehow  she baffled the robbers with italian irons  heated
red hot  and then restored to blackness by being dipped in grease 

we parted for the night with an awe stricken wonder as to what we should
hear of in the morning and  on my part  with a vehement desire for the
night to be over and gone  i was so afraid lest the robbers should have
seen  from some dark lurking place  that miss pole had carried off her
plate  and thus have a double motive for attacking our house 

                  picture  asked him to take care of us 

but until lady glenmire came to call next day we heard of nothing
unusual   the kitchen fire irons were in exactly the same position
against the back door as when martha and i had skilfully piled them up 
like spillikins  ready to fall with an awful clatter if only a cat had
touched the outside panels   i had wondered what we should all do if
thus awakened and alarmed  and had proposed to miss matty that we should
cover up our faces under the bed clothes so that there should be no
danger of the robbers thinking that we could identify them  but miss
matty  who was trembling very much  scouted this idea  and said we owed
it to society to apprehend them  and that she should certainly do her
best to lay hold of them and lock them up in the garret till morning 

when lady glenmire came  we almost felt jealous of her   mrs jamieson s
house had really been attacked  at least there were men s footsteps to
be seen on the flower borders  underneath the kitchen windows   where
nae men should be   and carlo had barked all through the night as if
strangers were abroad   mrs jamieson had been awakened by lady glenmire 
and they had rung the bell which communicated with mr mulliner s room in
the third storey  and when his night capped head had appeared over the
bannisters  in answer to the summons  they had told him of their alarm 
and the reasons for it  whereupon he retreated into his bedroom  and
locked the door  for fear of draughts  as he informed them in the
morning   and opened the window  and called out valiantly to say  if the
supposed robbers would come to him he would fight them  but  as lady
glenmire observed  that was but poor comfort  since they would have to
pass by mrs jamieson s room and her own before they could reach him  and
must be of a very pugnacious disposition indeed if they neglected the
opportunities of robbery presented by the unguarded lower storeys  to go
up to a garret  and there force a door in order to get at the champion
of the house   lady glenmire  after waiting and listening for some time
in the drawing room  had proposed to mrs jamieson that they should go to
bed  but that lady said she should not feel comfortable unless she sat
up and watched  and  accordingly  she packed herself warmly up on the
sofa  where she was found by the housemaid  when she came into the room
at six o clock  fast asleep  but lady glenmire went to bed  and kept
awake all night 

when miss pole heard of this  she nodded her head in great satisfaction 
she had been sure we should hear of something happening in cranford that
night  and we had heard   it was clear enough they had first proposed to
attack her house  but when they saw that she and betty were on their
guard  and had carried off the plate  they had changed their tactics and
gone to mrs jamieson s  and no one knew what might have happened if
carlo had not barked  like a good dog as he was 

poor carlo  his barking days were nearly over   whether the gang who
infested the neighbourhood were afraid of him  or whether they were
revengeful enough  for the way in which he had baffled them on the night
in question  to poison him  or whether  as some among the more
uneducated people thought  he died of apoplexy  brought on by too much
feeding and too little exercise  at any rate  it is certain that  two
days after this eventful night  carlo was found dead  with his poor legs
stretched out stiff in the attitude of running  as if by such unusual
exertion he could escape the sure pursuer  death 

we were all sorry for carlo  the old familiar friend who had snapped at
us for so many years  and the mysterious mode of his death made us very
uncomfortable   could signor brunoni be at the bottom of this   he had
apparently killed a canary with only a word of command  his will seemed
of deadly force  who knew but what he might yet be lingering in the
neighbourhood willing all sorts of awful things 

we whispered these fancies among ourselves in the evenings  but in the
mornings our courage came back with the daylight  and in a week s time
we had got over the shock of carlo s death  all but mrs jamieson   she 
poor thing  felt it as she had felt no event since her husband s death 
indeed  miss pole said  that as the honourable mr jamieson drank a good
deal  and occasioned her much uneasiness  it was possible that carlo s
death might be the greater affliction   but there was always a tinge of
cynicism in miss pole s remarks   however  one thing was clear and
certain it was necessary for mrs jamieson to have some change of scene 
and mr mulliner was very impressive on this point  shaking his head
whenever we inquired after his mistress  and speaking of her loss of
appetite and bad nights very ominously  and with justice too  for if she
had two characteristics in her natural state of health they were a
facility of eating and sleeping   if she could neither eat nor sleep 
she must be indeed out of spirits and out of health 

lady glenmire  who had evidently taken very kindly to cranford  did not
like the idea of mrs jamieson s going to cheltenham  and more than once
insinuated pretty plainly that it was mr mulliner s doing  who had been
much alarmed on the occasion of the house being attacked  and since had
said  more than once  that he felt it a very responsible charge to have
to defend so many women   be that as it might  mrs jamieson went to
cheltenham  escorted by mr mulliner  and lady glenmire remained in
possession of the house  her ostensible office being to take care that
the maid servants did not pick up followers   she made a very
pleasant looking dragon  and  as soon as it was arranged for her stay in
cranford  she found out that mrs jamieson s visit to cheltenham was just
the best thing in the world   she had let her house in edinburgh  and
was for the time house less  so the charge of her sister in law s
comfortable abode was very convenient and acceptable 

miss pole was very much inclined to instal herself as a heroine  because
of the decided steps she had taken in flying from the two men and one
woman  whom she entitled  that murderous gang    she described their
appearance in glowing colours  and i noticed that every time she went
over the story some fresh trait of villainy was added to their
appearance   one was tall he grew to be gigantic in height before we had
done with him  he of course had black hair and by and by it hung in
elf locks over his forehead and down his back   the other was short and
broad and a hump sprouted out on his shoulder before we heard the last
of him  he had red hair which deepened into carroty  and she was almost
sure he had a cast in the eye a decided squint   as for the woman  her
eyes glared  and she was masculine looking a perfect virago  most
probably a man dressed in woman s clothes  afterwards  we heard of a
beard on her chin  and a manly voice and a stride 

if miss pole was delighted to recount the events of that afternoon to
all inquirers  others were not so proud of their adventures in the
robbery line   mr hoggins  the surgeon  had been attacked at his own
door by two ruffians  who were concealed in the shadow of the porch  and
so effectually silenced him that he was robbed in the interval between
ringing his bell and the servant s answering it   miss pole was sure it
would turn out that this robbery had been committed by  her men   and
went the very day she heard the report to have her teeth examined  and
to question mr hoggins   she came to us afterwards  so we heard what she
had heard  straight and direct from the source  while we were yet in the
excitement and flutter of the agitation caused by the first
intelligence  for the event had only occurred the night before 

 well   said miss pole  sitting down with the decision of a person who
has made up her mind as to the nature of life and the world  and such
people never tread lightly  or seat themselves without a bump    well 
miss matty  men will be men   every mother s son of them wishes to be
considered samson and solomon rolled into one too strong ever to be
beaten or discomfited too wise ever to be outwitted   if you will
notice  they have always foreseen events  though they never tell one for
one s warning before the events happen   my father was a man  and i know
the sex pretty well  

she had talked herself out of breath  and we should have been very glad
to fill up the necessary pause as chorus  but we did not exactly know
what to say  or which man had suggested this diatribe against the sex 
so we only joined in generally  with a grave shake of the head  and a
soft murmur of  they are very incomprehensible  certainly  

 now  only think   said she    there  i have undergone the risk of
having one of my remaining teeth drawn  for one is terribly at the mercy
of any surgeon dentist  and i  for one  always speak them fair till i
have got my mouth out of their clutches   and  after all  mr hoggins is
too much of a man to own that he was robbed last night  

 not robbed   exclaimed the chorus 

 don t tell me   miss pole exclaimed  angry that we could be for a
moment imposed upon    i believe he was robbed  just as betty told me 
and he is ashamed to own it  and  to be sure  it was very silly of him
to be robbed just at his own door  i daresay he feels that such a thing
won t raise him in the eyes of cranford society  and is anxious to
conceal it but he need not have tried to impose upon me  by saying i
must have heard an exaggerated account of some petty theft of a neck of
mutton  which  it seems  was stolen out of the safe in his yard last
week  he had the impertinence to add  he believed that that was taken by
the cat   i have no doubt  if i could get at the bottom of it  it was
that irishman dressed up in woman s clothes  who came spying about my
house  with the story about the starving children  

after we had duly condemned the want of candour which mr hoggins had
evinced  and abused men in general  taking him for the representative
and type  we got round to the subject about which we had been talking
when miss pole came in  namely  how far  in the present disturbed state
of the country  we could venture to accept an invitation which miss
matty had just received from mrs forrester  to come as usual and keep
the anniversary of her wedding day by drinking tea with her at five
o clock  and playing a quiet pool afterwards   mrs forrester had said
that she asked us with some diffidence  because the roads were  she
feared  very unsafe   but she suggested that perhaps one of us would not
object to take the sedan  and that the others  by walking briskly  might
keep up with the long trot of the chairmen  and so we might all arrive
safely at over place  a suburb of the town    no  that is too large an
expression  a small cluster of houses separated from cranford by about
two hundred yards of a dark and lonely lane    there was no doubt but
that a similar note was awaiting miss pole at home  so her call was a
very fortunate affair  as it enabled us to consult together   we would
all much rather have declined this invitation  but we felt that it would
not be quite kind to mrs forrester  who would otherwise be left to a
solitary retrospect of her not very happy or fortunate life   miss matty
and miss pole had been visitors on this occasion for many years  and now
they gallantly determined to nail their colours to the mast  and to go
through darkness lane rather than fail in loyalty to their friend 

but when the evening came  miss matty  for it was she who was voted into
the chair  as she had a cold   before being shut down in the sedan  like
jack in a box  implored the chairmen  whatever might befall  not to run
away and leave her fastened up there  to be murdered  and even after
they had promised  i saw her tighten her features into the stern
determination of a martyr  and she gave me a melancholy and ominous
shake of the head through the glass   however  we got there safely  only
rather out of breath  for it was who could trot hardest through darkness
lane  and i am afraid poor miss matty was sadly jolted 

mrs forrester had made extra preparations  in acknowledgment of our
exertion in coming to see her through such dangers   the usual forms of
genteel ignorance as to what her servants might send up were all gone
through  and harmony and preference seemed likely to be the order of the
evening  but for an interesting conversation that began i don t know
how  but which had relation  of course  to the robbers who infested the
neighbourhood of cranford 

having braved the dangers of darkness lane  and thus having a little
stock of reputation for courage to fall back upon  and also  i daresay 
desirous of proving ourselves superior to men   videlicet  mr hoggins 
in the article of candour  we began to relate our individual fears  and
the private precautions we each of us took   i owned that my pet
apprehension was eyes eyes looking at me  and watching me  glittering
out from some dull  flat  wooden surface  and that if i dared to go up
to my looking glass when i was panic stricken  i should certainly turn
it round  with its back towards me  for fear of seeing eyes behind me
looking out of the darkness   i saw miss matty nerving herself up for a
confession  and at last out it came   she owned that  ever since she had
been a girl  she had dreaded being caught by her last leg  just as she
was getting into bed  by some one concealed under it   she said  when
she was younger and more active  she used to take a flying leap from a
distance  and so bring both her legs up safely into bed at once  but
that this had always annoyed deborah  who piqued herself upon getting
into bed gracefully  and she had given it up in consequence   but now
the old terror would often come over her  especially since miss pole s
house had been attacked  we had got quite to believe in the fact of the
attack having taken place   and yet it was very unpleasant to think of
looking under a bed  and seeing a man concealed  with a great  fierce
face staring out at you  so she had bethought herself of
something perhaps i had noticed that she had told martha to buy her a
penny ball  such as children play with and now she rolled this ball
under the bed every night  if it came out on the other side  well and
good  if not she always took care to have her hand on the bell rope  and
meant to call out john and harry  just as if she expected men servants
to answer her ring 

we all applauded this ingenious contrivance  and miss matty sank back
into satisfied silence  with a look at mrs forrester as if to ask for
 her  private weakness 

mrs forrester looked askance at miss pole  and tried to change the
subject a little by telling us that she had borrowed a boy from one of
the neighbouring cottages and promised his parents a hundredweight of
coals at christmas  and his supper every evening  for the loan of him at
nights   she had instructed him in his possible duties when he first
came  and  finding him sensible  she had given him the major s sword
 the major was her late husband   and desired him to put it very
carefully behind his pillow at night  turning the edge towards the head
of the pillow   he was a sharp lad  she was sure  for  spying out the
major s cocked hat  he had said  if he might have that to wear  he was
sure he could frighten two englishmen  or four frenchmen any day   but
she had impressed upon him anew that he was to lose no time in putting
on hats or anything else  but  if he heard any noise  he was to run at
it with his drawn sword   on my suggesting that some accident might
occur from such slaughterous and indiscriminate directions  and that he
might rush on jenny getting up to wash  and have spitted her before he
had discovered that she was not a frenchman  mrs forrester said she did
not think that that was likely  for he was a very sound sleeper  and
generally had to be well shaken or cold pigged in a morning before they
could rouse him   she sometimes thought such dead sleep must be owing to
the hearty suppers the poor lad ate  for he was half starved at home 
and she told jenny to see that he got a good meal at night 

           picture  slaughterous and indiscriminate directions 

still this was no confession of mrs forrester s peculiar timidity  and
we urged her to tell us what she thought would frighten her more than
anything   she paused  and stirred the fire  and snuffed the candles 
and then she said  in a sounding whisper 

 ghosts  

she looked at miss pole  as much as to say  she had declared it  and
would stand by it   such a look was a challenge in itself   miss pole
came down upon her with indigestion  spectral illusions  optical
delusions  and a great deal out of dr ferrier and dr hibbert besides 
miss matty had rather a leaning to ghosts  as i have mentioned before 
and what little she did say was all on mrs forrester s side  who 
emboldened by sympathy  protested that ghosts were a part of her
religion  that surely she  the widow of a major in the army  knew what
to be frightened at  and what not  in short  i never saw mrs forrester
so warm either before or since  for she was a gentle  meek  enduring old
lady in most things   not all the elder wine that ever was mulled could
this night wash out the remembrance of this difference between miss pole
and her hostess   indeed  when the elder wine was brought in  it gave
rise to a new burst of discussion  for jenny  the little maiden who
staggered under the tray  had to give evidence of having seen a ghost
with her own eyes  not so many nights ago  in darkness lane  the very
lane we were to go through on our way home 

in spite of the uncomfortable feeling which this last consideration gave
me  i could not help being amused at jenny s position  which was
exceedingly like that of a witness being examined and cross examined by
two counsel who are not at all scrupulous about asking leading
questions  the conclusion i arrived at was  that jenny had certainly
seen something beyond what a fit of indigestion would have caused   a
lady all in white  and without her head  was what she deposed and
adhered to  supported by a consciousness of the secret sympathy of her
mistress under the withering scorn with which miss pole regarded her 
and not only she  but many others  had seen this headless lady  who sat
by the roadside wringing her hands as in deep grief   mrs forrester
looked at us from time to time with an air of conscious triumph  but
then she had not to pass through darkness lane before she could bury
herself beneath her own familiar bed clothes 

we preserved a discreet silence as to the headless lady while we were
putting on our things to go home  for there was no knowing how near the
ghostly head and ears might be  or what spiritual connection they might
be keeping up with the unhappy body in darkness lane  and  therefore 
even miss pole felt that it was as well not to speak lightly on such
subjects  for fear of vexing or insulting that woebegone trunk   at
least  so i conjecture  for  instead of the busy clatter usual in the
operation  we tied on our cloaks as sadly as mutes at a funeral   miss
matty drew the curtains round the windows of the chair to shut out
disagreeable sights  and the men  either because they were in spirits
that their labours were so nearly ended  or because they were going down
hill   set off at such a round and merry pace  that it was all miss pole
and i could do to keep up with them   she had breath for nothing beyond
an imploring  don t leave me   uttered as she clutched my arm so tightly
that i could not have quitted her  ghost or no ghost   what a relief it
was when the men  weary of their burden and their quick trot  stopped
just where headingley causeway branches off from darkness lane   miss
pole unloosed me and caught at one of the men 

 could not you could not you take miss matty round by headingley
causeway  the pavement in darkness lane jolts so  and she is not very
strong  

a smothered voice was heard from the inside of the chair 

 oh  pray go on   what is the matter   what is the matter   i will give
you sixpence more to go on very fast  pray don t stop here  

 and i ll give you a shilling   said miss pole  with tremulous dignity 
 if you ll go by headingley causeway  

the two men grunted acquiescence and took up the chair  and went along
the causeway  which certainly answered miss pole s kind purpose of
saving miss matty s bones  for it was covered with soft  thick mud  and
even a fall there would have been easy till the getting up came  when
there might have been some difficulty in extrication 




chapter xi 
samuel brown


the next morning i met lady glenmire and miss pole setting out on a long
walk to find some old woman who was famous in the neighbourhood for her
skill in knitting woollen stockings   miss pole said to me  with a smile
half kindly and half contemptuous upon her countenance   i have been
just telling lady glenmire of our poor friend mrs forrester  and her
terror of ghosts   it comes from living so much alone  and listening to
the bug a boo stories of that jenny of hers    she was so calm and so
much above superstitious fears herself that i was almost ashamed to say
how glad i had been of her headingley causeway proposition the night
before  and turned off the conversation to something else 

in the afternoon miss pole called on miss matty to tell her of the
adventure the real adventure they had met with on their morning s walk 
they had been perplexed about the exact path which they were to take
across the fields in order to find the knitting old woman  and had
stopped to inquire at a little wayside public house  standing on the
high road to london  about three miles from cranford   the good woman
had asked them to sit down and rest themselves while she fetched her
husband  who could direct them better than she could  and  while they
were sitting in the sanded parlour  a little girl came in   they thought
that she belonged to the landlady  and began some trifling conversation
with her  but  on mrs roberts s return  she told them that the little
thing was the only child of a couple who were staying in the house   and
then she began a long story  out of which lady glenmire and miss pole
could only gather one or two decided facts  which were that  about six
weeks ago  a light spring cart had broken down just before their door 
in which there were two men  one woman  and this child   one of the men
was seriously hurt no bones broken  only  shaken   the landlady called
it  but he had probably sustained some severe internal injury  for he
had languished in their house ever since  attended by his wife  the
mother of this little girl  miss pole had asked what he was  what he
looked like   and mrs roberts had made answer that he was not like a
gentleman  nor yet like a common person  if it had not been that he and
his wife were such decent  quiet people  she could almost have thought
he was a mountebank  or something of that kind  for they had a great box
in the cart  full of she did not know what   she had helped to unpack
it  and take out their linen and clothes  when the other man his
twin brother  she believed he was had gone off with the horse and cart 

miss pole had begun to have her suspicions at this point  and expressed
her idea that it was rather strange that the box and cart and horse and
all should have disappeared  but good mrs roberts seemed to have become
quite indignant at miss pole s implied suggestion  in fact  miss pole
said she was as angry as if miss pole had told her that she herself was
a swindler   as the best way of convincing the ladies  she bethought her
of begging them to see the wife  and  as miss pole said  there was no
doubting the honest  worn  bronzed face of the woman  who at the first
tender word from lady glenmire  burst into tears  which she was too weak
to check until some word from the landlady made her swallow down her
sobs  in order that she might testify to the christian kindness shown by
mr and mrs roberts   miss pole came round with a swing to as vehement a
belief in the sorrowful tale as she had been sceptical before  and  as
a proof of this  her energy in the poor sufferer s behalf was nothing
daunted when she found out that he  and no other  was our signor
brunoni  to whom all cranford had been attributing all manner of evil
this six weeks past   yes  his wife said his proper name was samuel
brown  sam   she called him but to the last we preferred calling him
 the signor   it sounded so much better 

the end of their conversation with the signora brunoni was that it was
agreed that he should be placed under medical advice  and for any
expense incurred in procuring this lady glenmire promised to hold
herself responsible  and had accordingly gone to mr hoggins to beg him
to ride over to the  rising sun  that very afternoon  and examine into
the signor s real state  and  as miss pole said  if it was desirable to
remove him to cranford to be more immediately under mr hoggins s eye 
she would undertake to see for lodgings and arrange about the rent   mrs
roberts had been as kind as could be all throughout  but it was evident
that their long residence there had been a slight inconvenience 

before miss pole left us  miss matty and i were as full of the morning s
adventure as she was   we talked about it all the evening  turning it in
every possible light  and we went to bed anxious for the morning  when
we should surely hear from someone what mr hoggins thought and
recommended  for  as miss matty observed  though mr hoggins did say
 jack s up    a fig for his heels   and called preference  pref   she
believed he was a very worthy man and a very clever surgeon   indeed  we
were rather proud of our doctor at cranford  as a doctor   we often
wished  when we heard of queen adelaide or the duke of wellington being
ill  that they would send for mr hoggins  but  on consideration  we were
rather glad they did not  for  if we were ailing  what should we do if
mr hoggins had been appointed physician in ordinary to the royal family 
 as a surgeon we were proud of him  but as a man or rather  i should
say  as a gentleman we could only shake our heads over his name and
himself  and wished that he had read lord chesterfield s letters in the
days when his manners were susceptible of improvement   nevertheless  we
all regarded his dictum in the signor s case as infallible  and when he
said that with care and attention he might rally  we had no more fear
for him 

but  although we had no more fear  everybody did as much as if there was
great cause for anxiety as indeed there was until mr hoggins took charge
of him   miss pole looked out clean and comfortable  if homely 
lodgings  miss matty sent the sedan chair for him  and martha and i
aired it well before it left cranford by holding a warming pan full of
red hot coals in it  and then shutting it up close  smoke and all  until
the time when he should get into it at the  rising sun    lady glenmire
undertook the medical department under mr hoggins s directions  and
rummaged up all mrs jamieson s medicine glasses  and spoons  and
bed tables  in a free and easy way  that made miss matty feel a little
anxious as to what that lady and mr mulliner might say  if they knew 
mrs forrester made some of the bread jelly  for which she was so famous 
to have ready as a refreshment in the lodgings when he should arrive   a
present of this bread jelly was the highest mark of favour dear mrs
forrester could confer   miss pole had once asked her for the receipt 
but she had met with a very decided rebuff  that lady told her that she
could not part with it to any one during her life  and that after her
death it was bequeathed  as her executors would find  to miss matty 
what miss matty  or  as mrs forrester called her  remembering the clause
in her will and the dignity of the occasion   miss matilda jenkyns might
choose to do with the receipt when it came into her possession whether
to make it public  or to hand it down as an heirloom she did not know 
nor would she dictate   and a mould of this admirable  digestible 
unique bread jelly was sent by mrs forrester to our poor sick conjuror 
who says that the aristocracy are proud   here was a lady by birth a
tyrrell  and descended from the great sir walter that shot king rufus 
and in whose veins ran the blood of him who murdered the little princes
in the tower  going every day to see what dainty dishes she could
prepare for samuel brown  a mountebank   but  indeed  it was wonderful
to see what kind feelings were called out by this poor man s coming
amongst us   and also wonderful to see how the great cranford panic 
which had been occasioned by his first coming in his turkish dress 
melted away into thin air on his second coming pale and feeble  and with
his heavy  filmy eyes  that only brightened a very little when they fell
upon the countenance of his faithful wife  or their pale and sorrowful
little girl 

somehow we all forgot to be afraid   i daresay it was that finding out
that he  who had first excited our love of the marvellous by his
unprecedented arts  had not sufficient every day gifts to manage a
shying horse  made us feel as if we were ourselves again   miss pole
came with her little basket at all hours of the evening  as if her
lonely house and the unfrequented road to it had never been infested by
that  murderous gang   mrs forrester said she thought that neither jenny
nor she need mind the headless lady who wept and wailed in darkness
lane  for surely the power was never given to such beings to harm those
who went about to try to do what little good was in their power  to
which jenny tremblingly assented  but the mistress s theory had little
effect on the maid s practice until she had sewn two pieces of red
flannel in the shape of a cross on her inner garment 

i found miss matty covering her penny ball the ball that she used to
roll under her bed with gay coloured worsted in rainbow stripes 

 my dear   said she   my heart is sad for that little careworn child 
although her father is a conjuror  she looks as if she had never had a
good game of play in her life   i used to make very pretty balls in this
way when i was a girl  and i thought i would try if i could not make
this one smart and take it to phoebe this afternoon   i think  the gang 
must have left the neighbourhood  for one does not hear any more of
their violence and robbery now  

we were all of us far too full of the signor s precarious state to talk
either about robbers or ghosts   indeed  lady glenmire said she never
had heard of any actual robberies  except that two little boys had
stolen some apples from farmer benson s orchard  and that some eggs had
been missed on a market day off widow hayward s stall   but that was
expecting too much of us  we could not acknowledge that we had only had
this small foundation for all our panic   miss pole drew herself up at
this remark of lady glenmire s  and said  that she wished she could
agree with her as to the very small reason we had had for alarm  but
with the recollection of a man disguised as a woman who had endeavoured
to force himself into her house while his confederates waited outside 
with the knowledge gained from lady glenmire herself  of the footprints
seen on mrs jamieson s flower borders  with the fact before her of the
audacious robbery committed on mr hoggins at his own door  but here lady
glenmire broke in with a very strong expression of doubt as to whether
this last story was not an entire fabrication founded upon the theft of
a cat  she grew so red while she was saying all this that i was not
surprised at miss pole s manner of bridling up  and i am certain  if
lady glenmire had not been  her ladyship   we should have had a more
emphatic contradiction than the  well  to be sure   and similar
fragmentary ejaculations  which were all that she ventured upon in my
lady s presence   but when she was gone miss pole began a long
congratulation to miss matty that so far they had escaped marriage 
which she noticed always made people credulous to the last degree 
indeed  she thought it argued great natural credulity in a woman if she
could not keep herself from being married  and in what lady glenmire had
said about mr hoggins s robbery we had a specimen of what people came to
if they gave way to such a weakness  evidently lady glenmire would
swallow anything if she could believe the poor vamped up story about a
neck of mutton and a pussy with which he had tried to impose on miss
pole  only she had always been on her guard against believing too much
of what men said 

we were thankful  as miss pole desired us to be  that we had never been
married  but i think  of the two  we were even more thankful that the
robbers had left cranford  at least i judge so from a speech of miss
matty s that evening  as we sat over the fire  in which she evidently
looked upon a husband as a great protector against thieves  burglars 
and ghosts  and said that she did not think that she should dare to be
always warning young people against matrimony  as miss pole did
continually  to be sure  marriage was a risk  as she saw  now she had
had some experience  but she remembered the time when she had looked
forward to being married as much as any one 

 not to any particular person  my dear   said she  hastily checking
herself up  as if she were afraid of having admitted too much   only the
old story  you know  of ladies always saying    when  i marry   and
gentlemen    if  i marry     it was a joke spoken in rather a sad tone 
and i doubt if either of us smiled  but i could not see miss matty s
face by the flickering fire light   in a little while she continued 

 but  after all  i have not told you the truth   it is so long ago  and
no one ever knew how much i thought of it at the time  unless  indeed 
my dear mother guessed  but i may say that there was a time when i did
not think i should have been only miss matty jenkyns all my life  for
even if i did meet with any one who wished to marry me now  and  as miss
pole says  one is never too safe   i could not take him i hope he would
not take it too much to heart  but i could  not  take him or any one but
the person i once thought i should be married to  and he is dead and
gone  and he never knew how it all came about that i said  no   when i
had thought many and many a time well  it s no matter what i thought 
god ordains it all  and i am very happy  my dear   no one has such kind
friends as i   continued she  taking my hand and holding it in hers 

if i had never known of mr holbrook  i could have said something in this
pause  but as i had  i could not think of anything that would come in
naturally  and so we both kept silence for a little time 

 my father once made us   she began   keep a diary  in two columns  on
one side we were to put down in the morning what we thought would be the
course and events of the coming day  and at night we were to put down on
the other side what really had happened   it would be to some people
rather a sad way of telling their lives    a tear dropped upon my hand
at these words   i don t mean that mine has been sad  only so very
different to what i expected   i remember  one winter s evening  sitting
over our bedroom fire with deborah i remember it as if it were
yesterday and we were planning our future lives  both of us were
planning  though only she talked about it   she said she should like to
marry an archdeacon  and write his charges  and you know  my dear  she
never was married  and  for aught i know  she never spoke to an
unmarried archdeacon in her life   i never was ambitious  nor could i
have written charges  but i thought i could manage a house  my mother
used to call me her right hand   and i was always so fond of little
children the shyest babies would stretch out their little arms to come
to me  when i was a girl  i was half my leisure time nursing in the
neighbouring cottages  but i don t know how it was  when i grew sad and
grave which i did a year or two after this time the little things drew
back from me  and i am afraid i lost the knack  though i am just as fond
of children as ever  and have a strange yearning at my heart whenever i
see a mother with her baby in her arms   nay  my dear   and by a sudden
blaze which sprang up from a fall of the unstirred coals  i saw that her
eyes were full of tears gazing intently on some vision of what might
have been    do you know i dream sometimes that i have a little
child always the same a little girl of about two years old  she never
grows older  though i have dreamt about her for many years   i don t
think i ever dream of any words or sound she makes  she is very
noiseless and still  but she comes to me when she is very sorry or very
glad  and i have wakened with the clasp of her dear little arms round my
neck   only last night perhaps because i had gone to sleep thinking of
this ball for phoebe my little darling came in my dream  and put up her
mouth to be kissed  just as i have seen real babies do to real mothers
before going to bed   but all this is nonsense  dear  only don t be
frightened by miss pole from being married   i can fancy it may be a
very happy state  and a little credulity helps one on through life very
smoothly better than always doubting and doubting and seeing
difficulties and disagreeables in everything  

               picture  would stretch out their little arms 

if i had been inclined to be daunted from matrimony  it would not have
been miss pole to do it  it would have been the lot of poor signor
brunoni and his wife   and yet again  it was an encouragement to see
how  through all their cares and sorrows  they thought of each other and
not of themselves  and how keen were their joys  if they only passed
through each other  or through the little phoebe 

the signora told me  one day  a good deal about their lives up to this
period   it began by my asking her whether miss pole s story of the
twin brothers were true  it sounded so wonderful a likeness  that i
should have had my doubts  if miss pole had not been unmarried   but the
signora  or  as we found out she preferred to be called  mrs brown  said
it was quite true  that her brother in law was by many taken for her
husband  which was of great assistance to them in their profession 
 though   she continued   how people can mistake thomas for the real
signor brunoni  i can t conceive  but he says they do  so i suppose i
must believe him   not but what he is a very good man  i am sure i don t
know how we should have paid our bill at the  rising sun  but for the
money he sends  but people must know very little about art if they can
take him for my husband   why  miss  in the ball trick  where my husband
spreads his fingers wide  and throws out his little finger with quite an
air and a grace  thomas just clumps up his hand like a fist  and might
have ever so many balls hidden in it   besides  he has never been in
india  and knows nothing of the proper sit of a turban  

 have you been in india   said i  rather astonished 

 oh  yes  many a year  ma am   sam was a sergeant in the   st  and when
the regiment was ordered to india  i drew a lot to go  and i was more
thankful than i can tell  for it seemed as if it would only be a slow
death to me to part from my husband   but  indeed  ma am  if i had known
all  i don t know whether i would not rather have died there and then
than gone through what i have done since   to be sure  i ve been able to
comfort sam  and to be with him  but  ma am  i ve lost six children  
said she  looking up at me with those strange eyes that i ve never
noticed but in mothers of dead children with a kind of wild look in
them  as if seeking for what they never more might find    yes   six
children died off  like little buds nipped untimely  in that cruel
india   i thought  as each died  i never could i never would love a
child again  and when the next came  it had not only its own love  but
the deeper love that came from the thoughts of its little dead brothers
and sisters   and when phoebe was coming  i said to my husband   sam 
when the child is born  and i am strong  i shall leave you  it will cut
my heart cruel  but if this baby dies too  i shall go mad  the madness
is in me now  but if you let me go down to calcutta  carrying my baby
step by step  it will  maybe  work itself off  and i will save  and i
will hoard  and i will beg and i will die  to get a passage home to
england  where our baby may live    god bless him  he said i might go 
and he saved up his pay  and i saved every pice i could get for washing
or any way  and when phoebe came  and i grew strong again  i set off 
it was very lonely  through the thick forests  dark again with their
heavy trees along by the river s side  but i had been brought up near
the avon in warwickshire  so that flowing noise sounded like home  from
station to station  from indian village to village  i went along 
carrying my child   i had seen one of the officer s ladies with a little
picture  ma am done by a catholic foreigner  ma am of the virgin and the
little saviour  ma am   she had him on her arm  and her form was softly
curled round him  and their cheeks touched   well  when i went to bid
good bye to this lady  for whom i had washed  she cried sadly  for she 
too  had lost her children  but she had not another to save  like me 
and i was bold enough to ask her would she give me that print   and she
cried the more  and said her children were with that little blessed
jesus  and gave it me  and told me that she had heard it had been
painted on the bottom of a cask  which made it have that round shape 
and when my body was very weary  and my heart was sick  for there were
times when i misdoubted if i could ever reach my home  and there were
times when i thought of my husband  and one time when i thought my baby
was dying   i took out that picture and looked at it  till i could have
thought the mother spoke to me  and comforted me   and the natives were
very kind   we could not understand one another  but they saw my baby on
my breast  and they came out to me  and brought me rice and milk  and
sometimes flowers i have got some of the flowers dried   then  the next
morning  i was so tired  and they wanted me to stay with them i could
tell that and tried to frighten me from going into the deep woods 
which  indeed  looked very strange and dark  but it seemed to me as if
death was following me to take my baby away from me  and as if i must go
on  and on and i thought how god had cared for mothers ever since the
world was made  and would care for me  so i bade them good bye  and set
off afresh   and once when my baby was ill  and both she and i needed
rest  he led me to a place where i found a kind englishman lived  right
in the midst of the natives  

 and you reached calcutta safely at last  

 yes  safely   oh  when i knew i had only two days  journey more before
me  i could not help it  ma am it might be idolatry  i cannot tell but i
was near one of the native temples  and i went into it with my baby to
thank god for his great mercy  for it seemed to me that where others had
prayed before to their god  in their joy or in their agony  was of
itself a sacred place   and i got as servant to an invalid lady  who
grew quite fond of my baby aboard ship  and  in two years  time  sam
earned his discharge  and came home to me  and to our child   then he
had to fix on a trade  but he knew of none  and once  once upon a time 
he had learnt some tricks from an indian juggler  so he set up
conjuring  and it answered so well that he took thomas to help him as
his man  you know  not as another conjuror  though thomas has set it up
now on his own hook  but it has been a great help to us that likeness
between the twins  and made a good many tricks go off well that they
made up together   and thomas is a good brother  only he has not the
fine carriage of my husband  so that i can t think how he can be taken
for signor brunoni himself  as he says he is  

 poor little phoebe   said i  my thoughts going back to the baby she
carried all those hundred miles 

 ah  you may say so   i never thought i should have reared her  though 
when she fell ill at chunderabaddad  but that good  kind aga jenkyns
took us in  which i believe was the very saving of her  

 jenkyns   said i 

 yes  jenkyns   i shall think all people of that name are kind  for here
is that nice old lady who comes every day to take phoebe a walk  

but an idea had flashed through my head  could the aga jenkyns be the
lost peter   true he was reported by many to be dead   but  equally
true  some had said that he had arrived at the dignity of great lama of
thibet  miss matty thought he was alive   i would make further inquiry 




chapter xii 
engaged to be married


was the  poor peter  of cranford the aga jenkyns of chunderabaddad  or
was he not   as somebody says  that was the question 

in my own home  whenever people had nothing else to do  they blamed me
for want of discretion   indiscretion was my bug bear fault   everybody
has a bug bear fault  a sort of standing characteristic a  pi ce de
r sistance  for their friends to cut at  and in general they cut and
come again   i was tired of being called indiscreet and incautious  and
i determined for once to prove myself a model of prudence and wisdom   i
would not even hint my suspicions respecting the aga   i would collect
evidence and carry it home to lay before my father  as the family friend
of the two miss jenkynses 

in my search after facts  i was often reminded of a description my
father had once given of a ladies  committee that he had had to preside
over  he said he could not help thinking of a passage in dickens  which
spoke of a chorus in which every man took the tune he knew best  and
sang it to his own satisfaction   so  at this charitable committee 
every lady took the subject uppermost in her mind  and talked about it
to her own great contentment  but not much to the advancement of the
subject they had met to discuss   but even that committee could have
been nothing to the cranford ladies when i attempted to gain some clear
and definite information as to poor peter s height  appearance  and when
and where he was seen and heard of last   for instance  i remember
asking miss pole  and i thought the question was very opportune  for i
put it when i met her at a call at mrs forrester s  and both the ladies
had known peter  and i imagined that they might refresh each other s
memories  i asked miss pole what was the very last thing they had ever
heard about him  and then she named the absurd report to which i have
alluded  about his having been elected great lama of thibet  and this
was a signal for each lady to go off on her separate idea   mrs
forrester s start was made on the veiled prophet in lalla rookh whether
i thought he was meant for the great lama  though peter was not so ugly 
indeed rather handsome  if he had not been freckled   i was thankful to
see her double upon peter  but  in a moment  the delusive lady was off
upon rowland s kalydor  and the merits of cosmetics and hair oils in
general  and holding forth so fluently that i turned to listen to miss
pole  who  through the llamas  the beasts of burden  had got to peruvian
bonds  and the share market  and her poor opinion of joint stock banks
in general  and of that one in particular in which miss matty s money
was invested   in vain i put in  when was it in what year was it that
you heard that mr peter was the great lama    they only joined issue to
dispute whether llamas were carnivorous animals or not  in which dispute
they were not quite on fair grounds  as mrs forrester  after they had
grown warm and cool again  acknowledged that she always confused
carnivorous and graminivorous together  just as she did horizontal and
perpendicular  but then she apologised for it very prettily  by saying
that in her day the only use people made of four syllabled words was to
teach how they should be spelt 

the only fact i gained from this conversation was that certainly peter
had last been heard of in india   or that neighbourhood   and that this
scanty intelligence of his whereabouts had reached cranford in the year
when miss pole had brought her indian muslin gown  long since worn out
 we washed it and mended it  and traced its decline and fall into a
window blind before we could go on   and in a year when wombwell came to
cranford  because miss matty had wanted to see an elephant in order that
she might the better imagine peter riding on one  and had seen a
boa constrictor too  which was more than she wished to imagine in her
fancy pictures of peter s locality  and in a year when miss jenkyns had
learnt some piece of poetry off by heart  and used to say  at all the
cranford parties  how peter was  surveying mankind from china to peru  
which everybody had thought very grand  and rather appropriate  because
india was between china and peru  if you took care to turn the globe to
the left instead of the right 

i suppose all these inquiries of mine  and the consequent curiosity
excited in the minds of my friends  made us blind and deaf to what was
going on around us   it seemed to me as if the sun rose and shone  and
as if the rain rained on cranford  just as usual  and i did not notice
any sign of the times that could be considered as a prognostic of any
uncommon event  and  to the best of my belief  not only miss matty and
mrs forrester  but even miss pole herself  whom we looked upon as a kind
of prophetess  from the knack she had of foreseeing things before they
came to pass although she did not like to disturb her friends by telling
them her foreknowledge even miss pole herself was breathless with
astonishment when she came to tell us of the astounding piece of news 
but i must recover myself  the contemplation of it  even at this
distance of time  has taken away my breath and my grammar  and unless i
subdue my emotion  my spelling will go too 

we were sitting miss matty and i much as usual  she in the blue chintz
easy chair  with her back to the light  and her knitting in her hand  i
reading aloud the  st james s chronicle    a few minutes more  and we
should have gone to make the little alterations in dress usual before
calling time  twelve o clock  in cranford   i remember the scene and the
date well   we had been talking of the signor s rapid recovery since
the warmer weather had set in  and praising mr hoggins s skill  and
lamenting his want of refinement and manner  it seems a curious
coincidence that this should have been our subject  but so it was   when
a knock was heard a caller s knock three distinct taps and we were
flying  that is to say  miss matty could not walk very fast  having had
a touch of rheumatism  to our rooms  to change cap and collars  when
miss pole arrested us by calling out  as she came up the stairs   don t
go i can t wait it is not twelve  i know but never mind your dress i
must speak to you    we did our best to look as if it was not we who had
made the hurried movement  the sound of which she had heard  for  of
course  we did not like to have it supposed that we had any old clothes
that it was convenient to wear out in the  sanctuary of home   as miss
jenkyns once prettily called the back parlour  where she was tying up
preserves   so we threw our gentility with double force into our
manners  and very genteel we were for two minutes while miss pole
recovered breath  and excited our curiosity strongly by lifting up her
hands in amazement  and bringing them down in silence  as if what she
had to say was too big for words  and could only be expressed by
pantomime 

 what do you think  miss matty   what  do  you think   lady glenmire is
to marry is to be married  i mean lady glenmire mr hoggins mr hoggins is
going to marry lady glenmire  

 marry   said we    marry   madness  

                  picture  what do you think  miss matty 

 marry   said miss pole  with the decision that belonged to her
character     i  said marry  as you do  and i also said   what a fool my
lady is going to make of herself    i could have said  madness   but i
controlled myself  for it was in a public shop that i heard of it 
where feminine delicacy is gone to  i don t know   you and i  miss
matty  would have been ashamed to have known that our marriage was
spoken of in a grocer s shop  in the hearing of shopmen  

 but   said miss matty  sighing as one recovering from a blow   perhaps
it is not true   perhaps we are doing her injustice  

 no   said miss pole    i have taken care to ascertain that   i went
straight to mrs fitz adam  to borrow a cookery book which i knew she
had  and i introduced my congratulations    propos  of the difficulty
gentlemen must have in house keeping  and mrs fitz adam bridled up  and
said that she believed it was true  though how and where i could have
heard it she did not know   she said her brother and lady glenmire had
come to an understanding at last    understanding   such a coarse word 
but my lady will have to come down to many a want of refinement   i have
reason to believe mr hoggins sups on bread and cheese and beer every
night 

 marry   said miss matty once again    well   i never thought of it 
two people that we know going to be married   it s coming very near  

 so near that my heart stopped beating when i heard of it  while you
might have counted twelve   said miss pole 

 one does not know whose turn may come next   here  in cranford  poor
lady glenmire might have thought herself safe   said miss matty  with a
gentle pity in her tones 

 bah   said miss pole  with a toss of her head    don t you remember
poor dear captain brown s song  tibbie fowler   and the line 

     set her on the tintock tap 
    the wind will blaw a man till her   

 that was because  tibbie fowler  was rich  i think  

 well  there was a kind of attraction about lady glenmire that i  for
one  should be ashamed to have  

i put in my wonder    but how can she have fancied mr hoggins   i am not
surprised that mr hoggins has liked her  

 oh   i don t know   mr hoggins is rich  and very pleasant looking  
said miss matty   and very good tempered and kind hearted  

 she has married for an establishment  that s it   i suppose she takes
the surgery with it   said miss pole  with a little dry laugh at her own
joke   but  like many people who think they have made a severe and
sarcastic speech  which yet is clever of its kind  she began to relax in
her grimness from the moment when she made this allusion to the surgery 
and we turned to speculate on the way in which mrs jamieson would
receive the news   the person whom she had left in charge of her house
to keep off followers from her maids to set up a follower of her own 
and that follower a man whom mrs jamieson had tabooed as vulgar  and
inadmissible to cranford society  not merely on account of his name  but
because of his voice  his complexion  his boots  smelling of the stable 
and himself  smelling of drugs   had he ever been to see lady glenmire
at mrs jamieson s   chloride of lime would not purify the house in its
owner s estimation if he had   or had their interviews been confined to
the occasional meetings in the chamber of the poor sick conjuror  to
whom  with all our sense of the  m salliance   we could not help
allowing that they had both been exceedingly kind   and now it turned
out that a servant of mrs jamieson s had been ill  and mr hoggins had
been attending her for some weeks   so the wolf had got into the fold 
and now he was carrying off the shepherdess   what would mrs jamieson
say   we looked into the darkness of futurity as a child gazes after a
rocket up in the cloudy sky  full of wondering expectation of the
rattle  the discharge  and the brilliant shower of sparks and light 
then we brought ourselves down to earth and the present time by
questioning each other  being all equally ignorant  and all equally
without the slightest data to build any conclusions upon  as to when it
would take place   where   how much a year mr hoggins had   whether she
would drop her title   and how martha and the other correct servants in
cranford would ever be brought to announce a married couple as lady
glenmire and mr hoggins   but would they be visited   would mrs jamieson
let us   or must we choose between the honourable mrs jamieson and the
degraded lady glenmire   we all liked lady glenmire the best   she was
bright  and kind  and sociable  and agreeable  and mrs jamieson was
dull  and inert  and pompous  and tiresome   but we had acknowledged the
sway of the latter so long  that it seemed like a kind of disloyalty now
even to meditate disobedience to the prohibition we anticipated 

mrs forrester surprised us in our darned caps and patched collars  and
we forgot all about them in our eagerness to see how she would bear the
information  which we honourably left to miss pole  to impart  although 
if we had been inclined to take unfair advantage  we might have rushed
in ourselves  for she had a most out of place fit of coughing for five
minutes after mrs forrester entered the room   i shall never forget the
imploring expression of her eyes  as she looked at us over her
pocket handkerchief   they said  as plain as words could speak   don t
let nature deprive me of the treasure which is mine  although for a time
i can make no use of it    and we did not 

mrs forrester s surprise was equal to ours  and her sense of injury
rather greater  because she had to feel for her order  and saw more
fully than we could do how such conduct brought stains on the
aristocracy 

when she and miss pole left us we endeavoured to subside into calmness 
but miss matty was really upset by the intelligence she had heard   she
reckoned it up  and it was more than fifteen years since she had heard
of any of her acquaintance going to be married  with the one exception
of miss jessie brown  and  as she said  it gave her quite a shock  and
made her feel as if she could not think what would happen next 

i don t know whether it is a fancy of mine  or a real fact  but i have
noticed that  just after the announcement of an engagement in any set 
the unmarried ladies in that set flutter out in an unusual gaiety and
newness of dress  as much as to say  in a tacit and unconscious manner 
 we also are spinsters    miss matty and miss pole talked and thought
more about bonnets  gowns  caps  and shawls  during the fortnight that
succeeded this call  than i had known them do for years before   but it
might be the spring weather  for it was a warm and pleasant march  and
merinoes and beavers  and woollen materials of all sorts were but
ungracious receptacles of the bright sun s glancing rays   it had not
been lady glenmire s dress that had won mr hoggins s heart  for she went
about on her errands of kindness more shabby than ever   although in the
hurried glimpses i caught of her at church or elsewhere she appeared
rather to shun meeting any of her friends  her face seemed to have
almost something of the flush of youth in it  her lips looked redder and
more trembling full than in their old compressed state  and her eyes
dwelt on all things with a lingering light  as if she was learning to
love cranford and its belongings   mr hoggins looked broad and radiant 
and creaked up the middle aisle at church in a brand new pair of
top boots an audible  as well as visible  sign of his purposed change of
state  for the tradition went  that the boots he had worn till now were
the identical pair in which he first set out on his rounds in cranford
twenty five years ago  only they had been new pieced  high and low  top
and bottom  heel and sole  black leather and brown leather  more times
than any one could tell 

none of the ladies in cranford chose to sanction the marriage by
congratulating either of the parties   we wished to ignore the whole
affair until our liege lady  mrs jamieson  returned   till she came back
to give us our cue  we felt that it would be better to consider the
engagement in the same light as the queen of spain s legs facts which
certainly existed  but the less said about the better   this restraint
upon our tongues for you see if we did not speak about it to any of the
parties concerned  how could we get answers to the questions that we
longed to ask  was beginning to be irksome  and our idea of the dignity
of silence was paling before our curiosity  when another direction was
given to our thoughts  by an announcement on the part of the principal
shopkeeper of cranford  who ranged the trades from grocer and
cheesemonger to man milliner  as occasion required  that the spring
fashions were arrived  and would be exhibited on the following tuesday
at his rooms in high street   now miss matty had been only waiting for
this before buying herself a new silk gown   i had offered  it is true 
to send to drumble for patterns  but she had rejected my proposal 
gently implying that she had not forgotten her disappointment about the
sea green turban   i was thankful that i was on the spot now  to
counteract the dazzling fascination of any yellow or scarlet silk 

i must say a word or two here about myself   i have spoken of my
father s old friendship for the jenkyns family  indeed  i am not sure if
there was not some distant relationship   he had willingly allowed me to
remain all the winter at cranford  in consideration of a letter which
miss matty had written to him about the time of the panic  in which i
suspect she had exaggerated my powers and my bravery as a defender of
the house   but now that the days were longer and more cheerful  he was
beginning to urge the necessity of my return  and i only delayed in a
sort of odd forlorn hope that if i could obtain any clear information  i
might make the account given by the signora of the aga jenkyns tally
with that of  poor peter   his appearance and disappearance  which i had
winnowed out of the conversation of miss pole and mrs forrester 




chapter xiii 
stopped payment


the very tuesday morning on which mr johnson was going to show the
fashions  the post woman brought two letters to the house   i say the
post woman  but i should say the postman s wife   he was a lame
shoemaker  a very clean  honest man  much respected in the town  but he
never brought the letters round except on unusual occasions  such as
christmas day or good friday  and on those days the letters  which
should have been delivered at eight in the morning  did not make their
appearance until two or three in the afternoon  for every one liked poor
thomas  and gave him a welcome on these festive occasions   he used to
say   he was welly stawed wi  eating  for there were three or four
houses where nowt would serve  em but he must share in their breakfast  
and by the time he had done his last breakfast  he came to some other
friend who was beginning dinner  but come what might in the way of
temptation  tom was always sober  civil  and smiling  and  as miss
jenkyns used to say  it was a lesson in patience  that she doubted not
would call out that precious quality in some minds  where  but for
thomas  it might have lain dormant and undiscovered   patience was
certainly very dormant in miss jenkyns s mind   she was always expecting
letters  and always drumming on the table till the post woman had called
or gone past   on christmas day and good friday she drummed from
breakfast till church  from church time till two o clock unless when the
fire wanted stirring  when she invariably knocked down the fire irons 
and scolded miss matty for it  but equally certain was the hearty
welcome and the good dinner for thomas  miss jenkyns standing over him
like a bold dragoon  questioning him as to his children what they were
doing what school they went to  upbraiding him if another was likely to
make its appearance  but sending even the little babies the shilling and
the mince pie which was her gift to all the children  with half a crown
in addition for both father and mother   the post was not half of so
much consequence to dear miss matty  but not for the world would she
have diminished thomas s welcome and his dole  though i could see that
she felt rather shy over the ceremony  which had been regarded by miss
jenkyns as a glorious opportunity for giving advice and benefiting her
fellow creatures   miss matty would steal the money all in a lump into
his hand  as if she were ashamed of herself   miss jenkyns gave him each
individual coin separate  with a  there  that s for yourself  that s for
jenny   etc   miss matty would even beckon martha out of the kitchen
while he ate his food  and once  to my knowledge  winked at its rapid
disappearance into a blue cotton pocket handkerchief   miss jenkyns
almost scolded him if he did not leave a clean plate  however heaped it
might have been  and gave an injunction with every mouthful 

              picture  standing over him like a bold dragoon 

i have wandered a long way from the two letters that awaited us on the
breakfast table that tuesday morning   mine was from my father   miss
matty s was printed   my father s was just a man s letter  i mean it was
very dull  and gave no information beyond that he was well  that they
had had a good deal of rain  that trade was very stagnant  and there
were many disagreeable rumours afloat   he then asked me if i knew
whether miss matty still retained her shares in the town and county
bank  as there were very unpleasant reports about it  though nothing
more than he had always foreseen  and had prophesied to miss jenkyns
years ago  when she would invest their little property in it the only
unwise step that clever woman had ever taken  to his knowledge  the only
time she ever acted against his advice  i knew    however  if anything
had gone wrong  of course i was not to think of leaving miss matty while
i could be of any use  etc 

 who is your letter from  my dear   mine is a very civil invitation 
signed  edwin wilson   asking me to attend an important meeting of the
shareholders of the town and county bank  to be held in drumble  on
thursday the twenty first   i am sure  it is very attentive of them to
remember me  

i did not like to hear of this  important meeting   for  though i did
not know much about business  i feared it confirmed what my father said 
however  i thought  ill news always came fast enough  so i resolved to
say nothing about my alarm  and merely told her that my father was well 
and sent his kind regards to her   she kept turning over and admiring
her letter   at last she spoke 

 i remember their sending one to deborah just like this  but that i did
not wonder at  for everybody knew she was so clear headed   i am afraid
i could not help them much  indeed  if they came to accounts  i should
be quite in the way  for i never could do sums in my head   deborah  i
know  rather wished to go  and went so far as to order a new bonnet for
the occasion  but when the time came she had a bad cold  so they sent
her a very polite account of what they had done   chosen a director  i
think it was   do you think they want me to help them to choose a
director   i am sure i should choose your father at once  

 my father has no shares in the bank   said i 

 oh  no   i remember   he objected very much to deborah s buying any  i
believe   but she was quite the woman of business  and always judged for
herself  and here  you see  they have paid eight per cent  all these
years  

it was a very uncomfortable subject to me  with my half knowledge  so i
thought i would change the conversation  and i asked at what time she
thought we had better go and see the fashions    well  my dear   she
said   the thing is this  it is not etiquette to go till after twelve 
but then  you see  all cranford will be there  and one does not like to
be too curious about dress and trimmings and caps with all the world
looking on   it is never genteel to be over curious on these occasions 
deborah had the knack of always looking as if the latest fashion was
nothing new to her  a manner she had caught from lady arley  who did see
all the new modes in london  you know   so i thought we would just slip
down for i do want this morning  soon after breakfast half a pound of
tea and then we could go up and examine the things at our leisure  and
see exactly how my new silk gown must be made  and then  after twelve 
we could go with our minds disengaged  and free from thoughts of dress  

we began to talk of miss matty s new silk gown   i discovered that it
would be really the first time in her life that she had had to choose
anything of consequence for herself  for miss jenkyns had always been
the more decided character  whatever her taste might have been  and it
is astonishing how such people carry the world before them by the mere
force of will   miss matty anticipated the sight of the glossy folds
with as much delight as if the five sovereigns  set apart for the
purchase  could buy all the silks in the shop  and  remembering my own
loss of two hours in a toyshop before i could tell on what wonder to
spend a silver threepence  i was very glad that we were going early 
that dear miss matty might have leisure for the delights of perplexity 

if a happy sea green could be met with  the gown was to be sea green  if
not  she inclined to maize  and i to silver gray  and we discussed the
requisite number of breadths until we arrived at the shop door   we were
to buy the tea  select the silk  and then clamber up the iron corkscrew
stairs that led into what was once a loft  though now a fashion
show room 

the young men at mr johnson s had on their best looks  and their best
cravats  and pivoted themselves over the counter with surprising
activity   they wanted to show us upstairs at once  but on the principle
of business first and pleasure afterwards  we stayed to purchase the
tea  here miss matty s absence of mind betrayed itself   if she was
made aware that she had been drinking green tea at any time  she always
thought it her duty to lie awake half through the night afterward  i
have known her take it in ignorance many a time without such effects  
and consequently green tea was prohibited the house  yet to day she
herself asked for the obnoxious article  under the impression that she
was talking about the silk   however  the mistake was soon rectified 
and then the silks were unrolled in good truth   by this time the shop
was pretty well filled  for it was cranford market day  and many of the
farmers and country people from the neighbourhood round came in 
sleeking down their hair  and glancing shyly about  from under their
eyelids  as anxious to take back some notion of the unusual gaiety to
the mistress or the lasses at home  and yet feeling that they were out
of place among the smart shopmen and gay shawls and summer prints   one
honest looking man  however  made his way up to the counter at which we
stood  and boldly asked to look at a shawl or two   the other country
folk confined themselves to the grocery side  but our neighbour was
evidently too full of some kind intention towards mistress  wife or
daughter  to be shy  and it soon became a question with me  whether he
or miss matty would keep their shopmen the longest time   he thought
each shawl more beautiful than the last  and  as for miss matty  she
smiled and sighed over each fresh bale that was brought out  one colour
set off another  and the heap together would  as she said  make even the
rainbow look poor 

 i am afraid   said she  hesitating   whichever i choose i shall wish i
had taken another   look at this lovely crimson  it would be so warm in
winter   but spring is coming on  you know   i wish i could have a gown
for every season   said she  dropping her voice as we all did in
cranford whenever we talked of anything we wished for but could not
afford   however   she continued in a louder and more cheerful tone   it
would give me a great deal of trouble to take care of them if i had
them  so  i think  i ll only take one   but which must it be  my dear  

and now she hovered over a lilac with yellow spots  while i pulled out a
quiet sage green that had faded into insignificance under the more
brilliant colours  but which was nevertheless a good silk in its humble
way   our attention was called off to our neighbour   he had chosen a
shawl of about thirty shillings  value  and his face looked broadly
happy  under the anticipation  no doubt  of the pleasant surprise he
would give to some molly or jenny at home  he had tugged a leathern
purse out of his breeches pocket  and had offered a five pound note in
payment for the shawl  and for some parcels which had been brought round
to him from the grocery counter  and it was just at this point that he
attracted our notice   the shopman was examining the note with a
puzzled  doubtful air 

 town and county bank   i am not sure  sir  but i believe we have
received a warning against notes issued by this bank only this morning 
i will just step and ask mr johnson  sir  but i m afraid i must trouble
you for payment in cash  or in a note of a different bank  

i never saw a man s countenance fall so suddenly into dismay and
bewilderment   it was almost piteous to see the rapid change 

 dang it   said he  striking his fist down on the table  as if to try
which was the harder   the chap talks as if notes and gold were to be
had for the picking up  

miss matty had forgotten her silk gown in her interest for the man   i
don t think she had caught the name of the bank  and in my nervous
cowardice i was anxious that she should not  and so i began admiring the
yellow spotted lilac gown that i had been utterly condemning only a
minute before   but it was of no use 

 what bank was it   i mean  what bank did your note belong to  

 town and county bank  

 let me see it   said she quietly to the shopman  gently taking it out
of his hand  as he brought it back to return it to the farmer 

mr johnson was very sorry  but  from information he had received  the
notes issued by that bank were little better than waste paper 

 i don t understand it   said miss matty to me in a low voice    that is
our bank  is it not  the town and county bank  

 yes   said i    this lilac silk will just match the ribbons in your new
cap  i believe   i continued  holding up the folds so as to catch the
light  and wishing that the man would make haste and be gone  and yet
having a new wonder  that had only just sprung up  how far it was wise
or right in me to allow miss matty to make this expensive purchase  if
the affairs of the bank were really so bad as the refusal of the note
implied 

but miss matty put on the soft dignified manner  peculiar to her  rarely
used  and yet which became her so well  and laying her hand gently on
mine  she said 

 never mind the silks for a few minutes  dear   i don t understand you 
sir   turning now to the shopman  who had been attending to the farmer 
 is this a forged note  

 oh  no  ma am   it is a true note of its kind  but you see  ma am  it
is a joint stock bank  and there are reports out that it is likely to
break  mr johnson is only doing his duty  ma am  as i am sure mr dobson
knows  

but mr dobson could not respond to the appealing bow by any answering
smile   he was turning the note absently over in his fingers  looking
gloomily enough at the parcel containing the lately chosen shawl 

 it s hard upon a poor man   said he   as earns every farthing with the
sweat of his brow   however  there s no help for it   you must take back
your shawl  my man  lizzle must go on with her cloak for a while   and
yon figs for the little ones i promised them to  em i ll take them  but
the  bacco  and the other things  

 i will give you five sovereigns for your note  my good man   said miss
matty    i think there is some great mistake about it  for i am one of
the shareholders  and i m sure they would have told me if things had not
been going on right  

the shopman whispered a word or two across the table to miss matty   she
looked at him with a dubious air 

 perhaps so   said she    but i don t pretend to understand business  i
only know that if it is going to fail  and if honest people are to lose
their money because they have taken our notes i can t explain myself  
said she  suddenly becoming aware that she had got into a long sentence
with four people for audience   only i would rather exchange my gold for
the note  if you please   turning to the farmer   and then you can take
your wife the shawl   it is only going without my gown a few days
longer   she continued  speaking to me    then  i have no doubt 
everything will be cleared up  

 but if it is cleared up the wrong way   said i 

 why  then it will only have been common honesty in me  as a
shareholder  to have given this good man the money   i am quite clear
about it in my own mind  but  you know  i can never speak quite as
comprehensibly as others can  only you must give me your note  mr
dobson  if you please  and go on with your purchases with these
sovereigns  

      picture  you must give me your note  mr dobson  if you please 

the man looked at her with silent gratitude too awkward to put his
thanks into words  but he hung back for a minute or two  fumbling with
his note 

 i m loth to make another one lose instead of me  if it is a loss  but 
you see  five pounds is a deal of money to a man with a family  and  as
you say  ten to one in a day or two the note will be as good as gold
again  

 no hope of that  my friend   said the shopman 

 the more reason why i should take it   said miss matty quietly   she
pushed her sovereigns towards the man  who slowly laid his note down in
exchange    thank you   i will wait a day or two before i purchase any
of these silks  perhaps you will then have a greater choice   my dear 
will you come upstairs  

we inspected the fashions with as minute and curious an interest as if
the gown to be made after them had been bought   i could not see that
the little event in the shop below had in the least damped miss matty s
curiosity as to the make of sleeves or the sit of skirts   she once or
twice exchanged congratulations with me on our private and leisurely
view of the bonnets and shawls  but i was  all the time  not so sure
that our examination was so utterly private  for i caught glimpses of a
figure dodging behind the cloaks and mantles  and  by a dexterous move 
i came face to face with miss pole  also in morning costume  the
principal feature of which was her being without teeth  and wearing a
veil to conceal the deficiency   come on the same errand as ourselves 
but she quickly took her departure  because  as she said  she had a bad
headache  and did not feel herself up to conversation 

as we came down through the shop  the civil mr johnson was awaiting us 
he had been informed of the exchange of the note for gold  and with much
good feeling and real kindness  but with a little want of tact  he
wished to condole with miss matty  and impress upon her the true state
of the case   i could only hope that he had heard an exaggerated rumour
for he said that her shares were worse than nothing  and that the bank
could not pay a shilling in the pound   i was glad that miss matty
seemed still a little incredulous  but i could not tell how much of this
was real or assumed  with that self control which seemed habitual to
ladies of miss matty s standing in cranford  who would have thought
their dignity compromised by the slightest expression of surprise 
dismay  or any similar feeling to an inferior in station  or in a public
shop   however  we walked home very silently   i am ashamed to say  i
believe i was rather vexed and annoyed at miss matty s conduct in taking
the note to herself so decidedly   i had so set my heart upon her having
a new silk gown  which she wanted sadly  in general she was so undecided
anybody might turn her round  in this case i had felt that it was no use
attempting it  but i was not the less put out at the result 

somehow  after twelve o clock  we both acknowledged to a sated curiosity
about the fashions  and to a certain fatigue of body  which was  in
fact  depression of mind  that indisposed us to go out again   but still
we never spoke of the note  till  all at once  something possessed me to
ask miss matty if she would think it her duty to offer sovereigns for
all the notes of the town and county bank she met with   i could have
bitten my tongue out the minute i had said it   she looked up rather
sadly  and as if i had thrown a new perplexity into her already
distressed mind  and for a minute or two she did not speak   then she
said my own dear miss matty without a shade of reproach in her voice 

 my dear  i never feel as if my mind was what people call very strong 
and it s often hard enough work for me to settle what i ought to do with
the case right before me   i was very thankful to i was very thankful 
that i saw my duty this morning  with the poor man standing by me  but
its rather a strain upon me to keep thinking and thinking what i should
do if such and such a thing happened  and  i believe  i had rather wait
and see what really does come  and i don t doubt i shall be helped then
if i don t fidget myself  and get too anxious beforehand   you know 
love  i m not like deborah   if deborah had lived  i ve no doubt she
would have seen after them  before they had got themselves into this
state  

we had neither of us much appetite for dinner  though we tried to talk
cheerfully about indifferent things   when we returned into the
drawing room  miss matty unlocked her desk and began to look over her
account books   i was so penitent for what i had said in the morning 
that i did not choose to take upon myself the presumption to suppose
that i could assist her  i rather left her alone  as  with puzzled brow 
her eye followed her pen up and down the ruled page   by and by she shut
the book  locked the desk  and came and drew a chair to mine  where i
sat in moody sorrow over the fire   i stole my hand into hers  she
clasped it  but did not speak a word   at last she said  with forced
composure in her voice   if that bank goes wrong  i shall lose one
hundred and forty nine pounds thirteen shillings and fourpence a year  i
shall only have thirteen pounds a year left    i squeezed her hand hard
and tight   i did not know what to say   presently  it was too dark to
see her face  i felt her fingers work convulsively in my grasp  and i
knew she was going to speak again   i heard the sobs in her voice as she
said   i hope it s not wrong not wicked but  oh   i am so glad poor
deborah is spared this   she could not have borne to come down in the
world she had such a noble  lofty spirit  

this was all she said about the sister who had insisted upon investing
their little property in that unlucky bank   we were later in lighting
the candle than usual that night  and until that light shamed us into
speaking  we sat together very silently and sadly 

however  we took to our work after tea with a kind of forced
cheerfulness  which soon became real as far as it went   talking of that
never ending wonder  lady glenmire s engagement   miss matty was almost
coming round to think it a good thing 

 i don t mean to deny that men are troublesome in a house   i don t
judge from my own experience  for my father was neatness itself  and
wiped his shoes on coming in as carefully as any woman  but still a man
has a sort of knowledge of what should be done in difficulties  that it
is very pleasant to have one at hand ready to lean upon   now  lady
glenmire  instead of being tossed about  and wondering where she is to
settle  will be certain of a home among pleasant and kind people  such
as our good miss pole and mrs forrester   and mr hoggins is really a
very personable man  and as for his manners  why  if they are not very
polished  i have known people with very good hearts and very clever
minds too  who were not what some people reckoned refined  but who were
both true and tender  

she fell off into a soft reverie about mr holbrook  and i did not
interrupt her  i was so busy maturing a plan i had had in my mind for
some days  but which this threatened failure of the bank had brought to
a crisis   that night  after miss matty went to bed  i treacherously
lighted the candle again  and sat down in the drawing room to compose a
letter to the aga jenkyns  a letter which should affect him if he were
peter  and yet seem a mere statement of dry facts if he were a stranger 
the church clock pealed out two before i had done 

the next morning news came  both official and otherwise  that the town
and county bank had stopped payment   miss matty was ruined 

she tried to speak quietly to me  but when she came to the actual fact
that she would have but about five shillings a week to live upon  she
could not restrain a few tears 

 i am not crying for myself  dear   said she  wiping them away   i
believe i am crying for the very silly thought of how my mother would
grieve if she could know  she always cared for us so much more than for
herself   but many a poor person has less  and i am not very
extravagant  and  thank god  when the neck of mutton  and martha s
wages  and the rent are paid  i have not a farthing owing   poor martha 
 i think she ll be sorry to leave me  

miss matty smiled at me through her tears  and she would fain have had
me see only the smile  not the tears 




chapter xiv 
friends in need


it was an example to me  and i fancy it might be to many others  to see
how immediately miss matty set about the retrenchment which she knew to
be right under her altered circumstances   while she went down to speak
to martha  and break the intelligence to her  i stole out with my letter
to the aga jenkyns  and went to the signor s lodgings to obtain the
exact address   i bound the signora to secrecy  and indeed her military
manners had a degree of shortness and reserve in them which made her
always say as little as possible  except when under the pressure of
strong excitement   moreover  which made my secret doubly sure   the
signor was now so far recovered as to be looking forward to travelling
and conjuring again in the space of a few days  when he  his wife  and
little phoebe would leave cranford   indeed  i found him looking over a
great black and red placard  in which the signor brunoni s
accomplishments were set forth  and to which only the name of the town
where he would next display them was wanting   he and his wife were so
much absorbed in deciding where the red letters would come in with most
effect  it might have been the rubric for that matter   that it was some
time before i could get my question asked privately  and not before i
had given several decisions  the which i questioned afterwards with
equal wisdom of sincerity as soon as the signor threw in his doubts and
reasons on the important subject  at last i got the address  spelt by
sound  and very queer it looked   i dropped it in the post on my way
home  and then for a minute i stood looking at the wooden pane with a
gaping slit which divided me from the letter but a moment ago in my
hand   it was gone from me like life  never to be recalled   it would
get tossed about on the sea  and stained with sea waves perhaps  and be
carried among palm trees  and scented with all tropical fragrance  the
little piece of paper  but an hour ago so familiar and commonplace  had
set out on its race to the strange wild countries beyond the ganges 
but i could not afford to lose much time on this speculation   i
hastened home  that miss matty might not miss me  martha opened the door
to me  her face swollen with crying   as soon as she saw me she burst
out afresh  and taking hold of my arm she pulled me in  and banged the
door to  in order to ask me if indeed it was all true that miss matty
had been saying 

 i ll never leave her   no  i won t   i telled her so  and said i could
not think how she could find in her heart to give me warning   i could
not have had the face to do it  if i d been her   i might ha  been just
as good for nothing as mrs fitz adam s rosy  who struck for wages after
living seven years and a half in one place   i said i was not one to go
and serve mammon at that rate  that i knew when i d got a good missus 
if she didn t know when she d got a good servant  

 but  martha   said i  cutting in while she wiped her eyes 

 don t   but martha  me   she replied to my deprecatory tone 

 listen to reason  

 i ll not listen to reason   she said  now in full possession of her
voice  which had been rather choked with sobbing    reason always means
what someone else has got to say   now i think what i ve got to say is
good enough reason  but reason or not  i ll say it  and i ll stick to
it  i ve money in the savings bank  and i ve a good stock of clothes 
and i m not going to leave miss matty   no  not if she gives me warning
every hour in the day  

she put her arms akimbo  as much as to say she defied me  and  indeed  i
could hardly tell how to begin to remonstrate with her  so much did i
feel that miss matty  in her increasing infirmity  needed the attendance
of this kind and faithful woman 

 well  said i at last 

 i m thankful you begin with  well    if you d have begun with  but   as
you did afore  i d not ha  listened to you   now you may go on  

 i know you would be a great loss to miss matty  martha  

 i telled her so   a loss she d never cease to be sorry for   broke in
martha triumphantly 

 still  she will have so little so very little to live upon  that i
don t see just now how she could find you food she will even be pressed
for her own   i tell you this  martha  because i feel you are like a
friend to dear miss matty  but you know she might not like to have it
spoken about  

apparently this was even a blacker view of the subject than miss matty
had presented to her  for martha just sat down on the first chair that
came to hand  and cried out loud  we had been standing in the kitchen  

at last she put her apron down  and looking me earnestly in the face 
asked   was that the reason miss matty wouldn t order a pudding to day 
she said she had no great fancy for sweet things  and you and she would
just have a mutton chop   but i ll be up to her   never you tell  but
i ll make her a pudding  and a pudding she ll like  too  and i ll pay
for it myself  so mind you see she eats it   many a one has been
comforted in their sorrow by seeing a good dish come upon the table  

i was rather glad that martha s energy had taken the immediate and
practical direction of pudding making  for it staved off the quarrelsome
discussion as to whether she should or should not leave miss matty s
service   she began to tie on a clean apron  and otherwise prepare
herself for going to the shop for the butter  eggs  and what else she
might require   she would not use a scrap of the articles already in the
house for her cookery  but went to an old tea pot in which her private
store of money was deposited  and took out what she wanted 

i found miss matty very quiet  and not a little sad  but by and by she
tried to smile for my sake   it was settled that i was to write to my
father  and ask him to come over and hold a consultation  and as soon as
this letter was despatched we began to talk over future plans   miss
matty s idea was to take a single room  and retain as much of her
furniture as would be necessary to fit up this  and sell the rest  and
there to quietly exist upon what would remain after paying the rent 
for my part  i was more ambitious and less contented   i thought of all
the things by which a woman  past middle age  and with the education
common to ladies fifty years ago  could earn or add to a living without
materially losing caste  but at length i put even this last clause on
one side  and wondered what in the world miss matty could do 

teaching was  of course  the first thing that suggested itself   if miss
matty could teach children anything  it would throw her among the little
elves in whom her soul delighted   i ran over her accomplishments   once
upon a time i had heard her say she could play  ah  vous dirai je 
maman   on the piano  but that was long  long ago  that faint shadow of
musical acquirement had died out years before   she had also once been
able to trace out patterns very nicely for muslin embroidery  by dint of
placing a piece of silver paper over the design to be copied  and
holding both against the window pane while she marked the scollop and
eyelet holes   but that was her nearest approach to the accomplishment
of drawing  and i did not think it would go very far   then again  as to
the branches of a solid english education fancy work and the use of the
globes such as the mistress of the ladies  seminary  to which all the
tradespeople in cranford sent their daughters  professed to teach   miss
matty s eyes were failing her  and i doubted if she could discover the
number of threads in a worsted work pattern  or rightly appreciate the
different shades required for queen adelaide s face in the loyal
wool work now fashionable in cranford   as for the use of the globes  i
had never been able to find it out myself  so perhaps i was not a good
judge of miss matty s capability of instructing in this branch of
education  but it struck me that equators and tropics  and such mystical
circles  were very imaginary lines indeed to her  and that she looked
upon the signs of the zodiac as so many remnants of the black art 

what she piqued herself upon  as arts in which she excelled  was making
candle lighters  or  spills   as she preferred calling them   of
coloured paper  cut so as to resemble feathers  and knitting garters in
a variety of dainty stitches   i had once said  on receiving a present
of an elaborate pair  that i should feel quite tempted to drop one of
them in the street  in order to have it admired  but i found this little
joke  and it was a very little one  was such a distress to her sense of
propriety  and was taken with such anxious  earnest alarm  lest the
temptation might some day prove too strong for me  that i quite
regretted having ventured upon it   a present of these
delicately wrought garters  a bunch of gay  spills   or a set of cards
on which sewing silk was wound in a mystical manner  were the well known
tokens of miss matty s favour  but would any one pay to have their
children taught these arts  or  indeed  would miss matty sell  for
filthy lucre  the knack and the skill with which she made trifles of
value to those who loved her 

i had to come down to reading  writing  and arithmetic  and  in reading
the chapter every morning  she always coughed before coming to long
words   i doubted her power of getting through a genealogical chapter 
with any number of coughs   writing she did well and delicately but
spelling   she seemed to think that the more out of the way this was 
and the more trouble it cost her  the greater the compliment she paid to
her correspondent  and words that she would spell quite correctly in her
letters to me became perfect enigmas when she wrote to my father 

no  there was nothing she could teach to the rising generation of
cranford  unless they had been quick learners and ready imitators of her
patience  her humility  her sweetness  her quiet contentment with all
that she could not do   i pondered and pondered until dinner was
announced by martha  with a face all blubbered and swollen with crying 

miss matty had a few little peculiarities which martha was apt to regard
as whims below her attention  and appeared to consider as childish
fancies of which an old lady of fifty eight should try and cure herself 
but to day everything was attended to with the most careful regard   the
bread was cut to the imaginary pattern of excellence that existed in
miss matty s mind  as being the way which her mother had preferred  the
curtain was drawn so as to exclude the dead brick wall of a neighbour s
stable  and yet left so as to show every tender leaf of the poplar which
was bursting into spring beauty   martha s tone to miss matty was just
such as that good  rough spoken servant usually kept sacred for little
children  and which i had never heard her use to any grown up person 

i had forgotten to tell miss matty about the pudding  and i was afraid
she might not do justice to it  for she had evidently very little
appetite this day  so i seized the opportunity of letting her into the
secret while martha took away the meat   miss matty s eyes filled with
tears  and she could not speak  either to express surprise or delight 
when martha returned bearing it aloft  made in the most wonderful
representation of a lion  couchant  that ever was moulded   martha s
face gleamed with triumph as she set it down before miss matty with an
exultant  there    miss matty wanted to speak her thanks  but could not 
so she took martha s hand and shook it warmly  which set martha off
crying  and i myself could hardly keep up the necessary composure 
martha burst out of the room  and miss matty had to clear her voice once
or twice before she could speak   at last she said   i should like to
keep this pudding under a glass shade  my dear   and the notion of the
lion  couchant   with his currant eyes  being hoisted up to the place of
honour on a mantelpiece  tickled my hysterical fancy  and i began to
laugh  which rather surprised miss matty 

 i am sure  dear  i have seen uglier things under a glass shade before
now   said she 

so had i  many a time and oft  and i accordingly composed my countenance
 and now i could hardly keep from crying   and we both fell to upon the
pudding  which was indeed excellent only every morsel seemed to choke
us  our hearts were so full 

we had too much to think about to talk much that afternoon   it passed
over very tranquilly   but when the tea urn was brought in a new thought
came into my head   why should not miss matty sell tea be an agent to
the east india tea company which then existed   i could see no
objections to this plan  while the advantages were many always supposing
that miss matty could get over the degradation of condescending to
anything like trade   tea was neither greasy nor sticky grease and
stickiness being two of the qualities which miss matty could not endure 
 no shop window would be required   a small  genteel notification of her
being licensed to sell tea would  it is true  be necessary  but i hoped
that it could be placed where no one would see it   neither was tea a
heavy article  so as to tax miss matty s fragile strength   the only
thing against my plan was the buying and selling involved 

while i was giving but absent answers to the questions miss matty was
putting almost as absently we heard a clumping sound on the stairs  and
a whispering outside the door  which indeed once opened and shut as if
by some invisible agency   after a little while martha came in  dragging
after her a great tall young man  all crimson with shyness  and finding
his only relief in perpetually sleeking down his hair 

 please  ma am  he s only jem hearn   said martha  by way of an
introduction  and so out of breath was she that i imagine she had had
some bodily struggle before she could overcome his reluctance to be
presented on the courtly scene of miss matilda jenkyns s drawing room 

 and please  ma am  he wants to marry me off hand   and please  ma am 
we want to take a lodger just one quiet lodger  to make our two ends
meet  and we d take any house conformable  and  oh dear miss matty  if i
may be so bold  would you have any objections to lodging with us   jem
wants it as much as i do     to jem    you great oaf  why can t you back
me  but he does want it all the same  very bad don t you  jem  only  you
see  he s dazed at being called on to speak before quality  

          picture  please  ma am  he wants to marry me off hand 

 it s not that   broke in jem    it s that you ve taken me all on a
sudden  and i didn t think for to get married so soon and such quick
words does flabbergast a man   it s not that i m against it  ma am 
 addressing miss matty    only martha has such quick ways with her when
once she takes a thing into her head  and marriage  ma am marriage nails
a man  as one may say   i dare say i shan t mind it after it s once
over  

 please  ma am   said martha who had plucked at his sleeve  and nudged
him with her elbow  and otherwise tried to interrupt him all the time
he had been speaking  don t mind him  he ll come to   twas only last
night he was an axing me  and an axing me  and all the more because i
said i could not think of it for years to come  and now he s only taken
aback with the suddenness of the joy  but you know  jem  you are just as
full as me about wanting a lodger     another great nudge  

 ay  if miss matty would lodge with us otherwise i ve no mind to be
cumbered with strange folk in the house   said jem  with a want of tact
which i could see enraged martha  who was trying to represent a lodger
as the great object they wished to obtain  and that  in fact  miss matty
would be smoothing their path and conferring a favour  if she would only
come and live with them 

miss matty herself was bewildered by the pair  their  or rather martha s
sudden resolution in favour of matrimony staggered her  and stood
between her and the contemplation of the plan which martha had at heart 
 miss matty began 

 marriage is a very solemn thing  martha  

 it is indeed  ma am   quoth jem    not that i ve no objections to
martha  

 you ve never let me a be for asking me for to fix when i would be
married   said martha her face all a fire  and ready to cry with
vexation  and now you re shaming me before my missus and all  

 nay  now   martha don t ee  don t ee  only a man likes to have
breathing time   said jem  trying to possess himself of her hand  but in
vain   then seeing that she was more seriously hurt than he had
imagined  he seemed to try to rally his scattered faculties  and with
more straightforward dignity than  ten minutes before  i should have
thought it possible for him to assume  he turned to miss matty  and
said   i hope  ma am  you know that i am bound to respect every one who
has been kind to martha   i always looked on her as to be my wife some
time  and she has often and often spoken of you as the kindest lady that
ever was  and though the plain truth is  i would not like to be troubled
with lodgers of the common run  yet if  ma am  you d honour us by living
with us  i m sure martha would do her best to make you comfortable  and
i d keep out of your way as much as i could  which i reckon would be the
best kindness such an awkward chap as me could do  

miss matty had been very busy with taking off her spectacles  wiping
them  and replacing them  but all she could say was   don t let any
thought of me hurry you into marriage  pray don t   marriage is such a
very solemn thing  

 but miss matilda will think of your plan  martha   said i  struck with
the advantages that it offered  and unwilling to lose the opportunity of
considering about it    and i m sure neither she nor i can ever forget
your kindness  nor yours either  jem  

 why  yes  ma am   i m sure i mean kindly  though i m a bit fluttered by
being pushed straight ahead into matrimony  as it were  and mayn t
express myself conformable   but i m sure i m willing enough  and give
me time to get accustomed  so  martha  wench  what s the use of crying
so  and slapping me if i come near  

this last was  sotto voce   and had the effect of making martha bounce
out of the room  to be followed and soothed by her lover   whereupon
miss matty sat down and cried very heartily  and accounted for it by
saying that the thought of martha being married so soon gave her quite a
shock  and that she should never forgive herself if she thought she was
hurrying the poor creature   i think my pity was more for jem  of the
two  but both miss matty and i appreciated to the full the kindness of
the honest couple  although we said little about this  and a good deal
about the chances and dangers of matrimony 

the next morning  very early  i received a note from miss pole  so
mysteriously wrapped up  and with so many seals on it to secure secrecy 
that i had to tear the paper before i could unfold it   and when i came
to the writing i could hardly understand the meaning  it was so involved
and oracular   i made out  however  that i was to go to miss pole s at
eleven o clock  the number  eleven  being written in full length as well
as in numerals  and  a m   twice dashed under  as if i were very likely
to come at eleven at night  when all cranford was usually abed and
asleep by ten   there was no signature except miss pole s initials
reversed  p e   but as martha had given me the note   with miss pole s
kind regards   it needed no wizard to find out who sent it  and if the
writer s name was to be kept secret  it was very well that i was alone
when martha delivered it 

i went as requested to miss pole s   the door was opened to me by her
little maid lizzy in sunday trim  as if some grand event was impending
over this work day   and the drawing room upstairs was arranged in
accordance with this idea   the table was set out with the best green
card cloth  and writing materials upon it   on the little chiffonier was
a tray with a newly decanted bottle of cowslip wine  and some
ladies  finger biscuits   miss pole herself was in solemn array  as if
to receive visitors  although it was only eleven o clock   mrs forrester
was there  crying quietly and sadly  and my arrival seemed only to call
forth fresh tears   before we had finished our greetings  performed with
lugubrious mystery of demeanour  there was another rat tat tat  and mrs
fitz adam appeared  crimson with walking and excitement   it seemed as
if this was all the company expected  for now miss pole made several
demonstrations of being about to open the business of the meeting  by
stirring the fire  opening and shutting the door  and coughing and
blowing her nose   then she arranged us all round the table  taking care
to place me opposite to her  and last of all  she inquired of me if the
sad report was true  as she feared it was  that miss matty had lost all
her fortune 

of course  i had but one answer to make  and i never saw more unaffected
sorrow depicted on any countenances than i did there on the three before
me 

 i wish mrs jamieson was here   said mrs forrester at last  but to judge
from mrs fitz adam s face  she could not second the wish 

 but without mrs jamieson   said miss pole  with just a sound of
offended merit in her voice   we  the ladies of cranford  in my
drawing room assembled  can resolve upon something   i imagine we are
none of us what may be called rich  though we all possess a genteel
competency  sufficient for tastes that are elegant and refined  and
would not  if they could  be vulgarly ostentatious     here i observed
miss pole refer to a small card concealed in her hand  on which i
imagine she had put down a few notes  

 miss smith   she continued  addressing me  familiarly known as  mary 
to all the company assembled  but this was a state occasion    i have
conversed in private i made it my business to do so yesterday
afternoon with these ladies on the misfortune which has happened to our
friend  and one and all of us have agreed that while we have a
superfluity  it is not only a duty  but a pleasure a true pleasure 
mary   her voice was rather choked just here  and she had to wipe her
spectacles before she could go on  to give what we can to assist
her miss matilda jenkyns   only in consideration of the feelings of
delicate independence existing in the mind of every refined female  i
was sure she had got back to the card now  we wish to contribute our
mites in a secret and concealed manner  so as not to hurt the feelings i
have referred to  and our object in requesting you to meet us this
morning is that  believing you are the daughter that your father is  in
fact  her confidential adviser  in all pecuniary matters  we imagined
that  by consulting with him  you might devise some mode in which our
contribution could be made to appear the legal due which miss matilda
jenkyns ought to receive from   probably your father  knowing her
investments  can fill up the blank  

miss pole concluded her address  and looked round for approval and
agreement 

 i have expressed your meaning  ladies  have i not   and while miss
smith considers what reply to make  allow me to offer you some little
refreshment  

i had no great reply to make  i had more thankfulness at my heart for
their kind thoughts than i cared to put into words  and so i only
mumbled out something to the effect  that i would name what miss pole
had said to my father  and that if anything could be arranged for dear
miss matty   and here i broke down utterly  and had to be refreshed with
a glass of cowslip wine before i could check the crying which had been
repressed for the last two or three days   the worst was  all the ladies
cried in concert   even miss pole cried  who had said a hundred times
that to betray emotion before any one was a sign of weakness and want of
self control   she recovered herself into a slight degree of impatient
anger  directed against me  as having set them all off  and  moreover  i
think she was vexed that i could not make a speech back in return for
hers  and if i had known beforehand what was to be said  and had a card
on which to express the probable feelings that would rise in my heart  i
would have tried to gratify her   as it was  mrs forrester was the
person to speak when we had recovered our composure 

 i don t mind  among friends  stating that i no   i m not poor exactly 
but i don t think i m what you may call rich  i wish i were  for dear
miss matty s sake but  if you please  i ll write down in a sealed paper
what i can give   i only wish it was more  my dear mary  i do indeed  

now i saw why paper  pens  and ink were provided   every lady wrote down
the sum she could give annually  signed the paper  and sealed it
mysteriously   if their proposal was acceded to  my father was to be
allowed to open the papers  under pledge of secrecy   if not  they were
to be returned to their writers 

when the ceremony had been gone through  i rose to depart  but each lady
seemed to wish to have a private conference with me   miss pole kept me
in the drawing room to explain why  in mrs jamieson s absence  she had
taken the lead in this  movement   as she was pleased to call it  and
also to inform me that she had heard from good sources that mrs jamieson
was coming home directly in a state of high displeasure against her
sister in law  who was forthwith to leave her house  and was  she
believed  to return to edinburgh that very afternoon   of course this
piece of intelligence could not be communicated before mrs fitz adam 
more especially as miss pole was inclined to think that lady glenmire s
engagement to mr hoggins could not possibly hold against the blaze of
mrs jamieson s displeasure   a few hearty inquiries after miss matty s
health concluded my interview with miss pole 

on coming downstairs i found mrs forrester waiting for me at the
entrance to the dining parlour  she drew me in  and when the door was
shut  she tried two or three times to begin on some subject  which was
so unapproachable apparently  that i began to despair of our ever
getting to a clear understanding   at last out it came  the poor old
lady trembling all the time as if it were a great crime which she was
exposing to daylight  in telling me how very  very little she had to
live upon  a confession which she was brought to make from a dread lest
we should think that the small contribution named in her paper bore any
proportion to her love and regard for miss matty   and yet that sum
which she so eagerly relinquished was  in truth  more than a twentieth
part of what she had to live upon  and keep house  and a little
serving maid  all as became one born a tyrrell   and when the whole
income does not nearly amount to a hundred pounds  to give up a
twentieth of it will necessitate many careful economies  and many pieces
of self denial  small and insignificant in the world s account  but
bearing a different value in another account book that i have heard of 
she did so wish she was rich  she said  and this wish she kept
repeating  with no thought of herself in it  only with a longing 
yearning desire to be able to heap up miss matty s measure of comforts 

it was some time before i could console her enough to leave her  and
then  on quitting the house  i was waylaid by mrs fitz adam  who had
also her confidence to make of pretty nearly the opposite description 
she had not liked to put down all that she could afford and was ready to
give   she told me she thought she never could look miss matty in the
face again if she presumed to be giving her so much as she should like
to do    miss matty   continued she   that i thought was such a fine
young lady when i was nothing but a country girl  coming to market with
eggs and butter and such like things   for my father  though well to do 
would always make me go on as my mother had done before me  and i had to
come into cranford every saturday  and see after sales  and prices  and
what not   and one day  i remember  i met miss matty in the lane that
leads to combehurst  she was walking on the footpath  which  you know 
is raised a good way above the road  and a gentleman rode beside her 
and was talking to her  and she was looking down at some primroses she
had gathered  and pulling them all to pieces  and i do believe she was
crying   but after she had passed  she turned round and ran after me to
ask oh  so kindly about my poor mother  who lay on her death bed  and
when i cried she took hold of my hand to comfort me and the gentleman
waiting for her all the time and her poor heart very full of something 
i am sure  and i thought it such an honour to be spoken to in that
pretty way by the rector s daughter  who visited at arley hall   i have
loved her ever since  though perhaps i d no right to do it  but if you
can think of any way in which i might be allowed to give a little more
without any one knowing it  i should be so much obliged to you  my dear 
 and my brother would be delighted to doctor her for nothing medicines 
leeches  and all  i know that he and her ladyship  my dear  i little
thought in the days i was telling you of that i should ever come to be
sister in law to a ladyship   would do anything for her   we all would  

i told her i was quite sure of it  and promised all sorts of things in
my anxiety to get home to miss matty  who might well be wondering what
had become of me absent from her two hours without being able to account
for it   she had taken very little note of time  however  as she had
been occupied in numberless little arrangements preparatory to the great
step of giving up her house   it was evidently a relief to her to be
doing something in the way of retrenchment  for  as she said  whenever
she paused to think  the recollection of the poor fellow with his bad
five pound note came over her  and she felt quite dishonest  only if it
made her so uncomfortable  what must it not be doing to the directors of
the bank  who must know so much more of the misery consequent upon this
failure   she almost made me angry by dividing her sympathy between
these directors  whom she imagined overwhelmed by self reproach for the
mismanagement of other people s affairs  and those who were suffering
like her   indeed  of the two  she seemed to think poverty a lighter
burden than self reproach  but i privately doubted if the directors
would agree with her 

old hoards were taken out and examined as to their money value which
luckily was small  or else i don t know how miss matty would have
prevailed upon herself to part with such things as her mother s
wedding ring  the strange  uncouth brooch with which her father had
disfigured his shirt frill   c   however  we arranged things a little in
order as to their pecuniary estimation  and were all ready for my father
when he came the next morning 

i am not going to weary you with the details of all the business we went
through  and one reason for not telling about them is  that i did not
understand what we were doing at the time  and cannot recollect it now 
miss matty and i sat assenting to accounts  and schemes  and reports 
and documents  of which i do not believe we either of us understood a
word  for my father was clear headed and decisive  and a capital man of
business  and if we made the slightest inquiry  or expressed the
slightest want of comprehension  he had a sharp way of saying   eh  eh 
it s as clear as daylight   what s your objection    and as we had not
comprehended anything of what he had proposed  we found it rather
difficult to shape our objections  in fact  we never were sure if we had
any   so presently miss matty got into a nervously acquiescent state 
and said  yes   and  certainly   at every pause  whether required or
not  but when i once joined in as chorus to a  decidedly   pronounced by
miss matty in a tremblingly dubious tone  my father fired round at me
and asked me  what there was to decide    and i am sure to this day i
have never known   but  in justice to him  i must say he had come over
from drumble to help miss matty when he could ill spare the time  and
when his own affairs were in a very anxious state 

           picture  miss matty and i sat assenting to accounts 

while miss matty was out of the room giving orders for luncheon and
sadly perplexed between her desire of honouring my father by a delicate 
dainty meal  and her conviction that she had no right  now that all her
money was gone  to indulge this desire i told him of the meeting of the
cranford ladies at miss pole s the day before   he kept brushing his
hand before his eyes as i spoke and when i went back to martha s offer
the evening before  of receiving miss matty as a lodger  he fairly
walked away from me to the window  and began drumming with his fingers
upon it  then he turned abruptly round  and said   see  mary  how a
good  innocent life makes friends all around   confound it   i could
make a good lesson out of it if i were a parson  but  as it is  i can t
get a tail to my sentences only i m sure you feel what i want to say 
you and i will have a walk after lunch and talk a bit more about these
plans  

the lunch a hot savoury mutton chop  and a little of the cold loin
sliced and fried was now brought in   every morsel of this last dish was
finished  to martha s great gratification   then my father bluntly told
miss matty he wanted to talk to me alone  and that he would stroll out
and see some of the old places  and then i could tell her what plan we
thought desirable   just before we went out  she called me back and
said   remember  dear  i m the only one left i mean  there s no one to
be hurt by what i do   i m willing to do anything that s right and
honest  and i don t think  if deborah knows where she is  she ll care so
very much if i m not genteel  because  you see  she ll know all  dear 
only let me see what i can do  and pay the poor people as far as i m
able  

i gave her a hearty kiss  and ran after my father   the result of our
conversation was this   if all parties were agreeable  martha and jem
were to be married with as little delay as possible  and they were to
live on in miss matty s present abode  the sum which the cranford ladies
had agreed to contribute annually being sufficient to meet the greater
part of the rent  and leaving martha free to appropriate what miss matty
should pay for her lodgings to any little extra comforts required 
about the sale  my father was dubious at first   he said the old rectory
furniture  however carefully used and reverently treated  would fetch
very little  and that little would be but as a drop in the sea of the
debts of the town and county bank   but when i represented how miss
matty s tender conscience would be soothed by feeling that she had done
what she could  he gave way  especially after i had told him the
five pound note adventure  and he had scolded me well for allowing it 
i then alluded to my idea that she might add to her small income by
selling tea  and  to my surprise  for i had nearly given up the plan  
my father grasped at it with all the energy of a tradesman   i think he
reckoned his chickens before they were hatched  for he immediately ran
up the profits of the sales that she could effect in cranford to more
than twenty pounds a year   the small dining parlour was to be converted
into a shop  without any of its degrading characteristics  a table was
to be the counter  one window was to be retained unaltered  and the
other changed into a glass door   i evidently rose in his estimation for
having made this bright suggestion   i only hoped we should not both
fall in miss matty s 

but she was patient and content with all our arrangements   she knew 
she said  that we should do the best we could for her  and she only
hoped  only stipulated  that she should pay every farthing that she
could be said to owe  for her father s sake  who had been so respected
in cranford   my father and i had agreed to say as little as possible
about the bank  indeed never to mention it again  if it could be helped 
 some of the plans were evidently a little perplexing to her  but she
had seen me sufficiently snubbed in the morning for want of
comprehension to venture on too many inquiries now  and all passed over
well with a hope on her part that no one would be hurried into marriage
on her account  when we came to the proposal that she should sell tea  i
could see it was rather a shock to her  not on account of any personal
loss of gentility involved  but only because she distrusted her own
powers of action in a new line of life  and would timidly have preferred
a little more privation to any exertion for which she feared she was
unfitted  however  when she saw my father was bent upon it  she sighed 
and said she would try  and if she did not do well  of course she might
give it up   one good thing about it was  she did not think men ever
bought tea  and it was of men particularly she was afraid   they had
such sharp loud ways with them  and did up accounts  and counted their
change so quickly  now  if she might only sell comfits to children  she
was sure she could please them 




chapter xv 
a happy return


before i left miss matty at cranford everything had been comfortably
arranged for her   even mrs jamieson s approval of her selling tea had
been gained   that oracle had taken a few days to consider whether by so
doing miss matty would forfeit her right to the privileges of society in
cranford   i think she had some little idea of mortifying lady glenmire
by the decision she gave at last  which was to this effect  that whereas
a married woman takes her husband s rank by the strict laws of
precedence  an unmarried woman retains the station her father occupied 
so cranford was allowed to visit miss matty  and  whether allowed or
not  it intended to visit lady glenmire 

but what was our surprise our dismay when we learnt that mr and  mrs
hoggins  were returning on the following tuesday   mrs hoggins   had
she absolutely dropped her title  and so  in a spirit of bravado  cut
the aristocracy to become a hoggins   she  who might have been called
lady glenmire to her dying day   mrs jamieson was pleased   she said it
only convinced her of what she had known from the first  that the
creature had a low taste   but  the creature  looked very happy on
sunday at church  nor did we see it necessary to keep our veils down on
that side of our bonnets on which mr and mrs hoggins sat  as mrs
jamieson did  thereby missing all the smiling glory of his face  and all
the becoming blushes of hers   i am not sure if martha and jem looked
more radiant in the afternoon  when they  too  made their first
appearance   mrs jamieson soothed the turbulence of her soul by having
the blinds of her windows drawn down  as if for a funeral  on the day
when mr and mrs hoggins received callers  and it was with some
difficulty that she was prevailed upon to continue the  st james s
chronicle   so indignant was she with its having inserted the
announcement of the marriage 

            picture  smiling glory     and becoming blushes 

miss matty s sale went off famously   she retained the furniture of her
sitting room and bedroom  the former of which she was to occupy till
martha could meet with a lodger who might wish to take it  and into this
sitting room and bedroom she had to cram all sorts of things  which were
 the auctioneer assured her  bought in for her at the sale by an unknown
friend   i always suspected mrs fitz adam of this  but she must have had
an accessory  who knew what articles were particularly regarded by miss
matty on account of their associations with her early days   the rest of
the house looked rather bare  to be sure  all except one tiny bedroom 
of which my father allowed me to purchase the furniture for my
occasional use in case of miss matty s illness 

i had expended my own small store in buying all manner of comfits and
lozenges  in order to tempt the little people whom miss matty loved so
much to come about her   tea in bright green canisters  and comfits in
tumblers miss matty and i felt quite proud as we looked round us on the
evening before the shop was to be opened   martha had scoured the
boarded floor to a white cleanness  and it was adorned with a brilliant
piece of oil cloth  on which customers were to stand before the
table counter  the wholesome smell of plaster and whitewash pervaded the
apartment   a very small  matilda jenkyns  licensed to sell tea   was
hidden under the lintel of the new door  and two boxes of tea  with
cabalistic inscriptions all over them  stood ready to disgorge their
contents into the canisters 

miss matty  as i ought to have mentioned before  had had some scruples
of conscience at selling tea when there was already mr johnson in the
town  who included it among his numerous commodities  and  before she
could quite reconcile herself to the adoption of her new business  she
had trotted down to his shop  unknown to me  to tell him of the project
that was entertained  and to inquire if it was likely to injure his
business  my father called this idea of hers  great nonsense   and
 wondered how tradespeople were to get on if there was to be a continual
consulting of each other s interests  which would put a stop to all
competition directly    and  perhaps  it would not have done in drumble 
but in cranford it answered very well  for not only did mr johnson
kindly put at rest all miss matty s scruples and fear of injuring his
business  but i have reason to know he repeatedly sent customers to her 
saying that the teas he kept were of a common kind  but that miss
jenkyns had all the choice sorts   and expensive tea is a very favourite
luxury with well to do tradespeople and rich farmers  wives  who turn up
their noses at the congou and souchong prevalent at many tables of
gentility  and will have nothing else than gunpowder and pekoe for
themselves 

but to return to miss matty   it was really very pleasant to see how her
unselfishness and simple sense of justice called out the same good
qualities in others   she never seemed to think any one would impose
upon her  because she should be so grieved to do it to them   i have
heard her put a stop to the asseverations of the man who brought her
coals by quietly saying   i am sure you would be sorry to bring me wrong
weight   and if the coals were short measure that time  i don t believe
they ever were again   people would have felt as much ashamed of
presuming on her good faith as they would have done on that of a child 
but my father says  such simplicity might be very well in cranford  but
would never do in the world    and i fancy the world must be very bad 
for with all my father s suspicion of every one with whom he has
dealings  and in spite of all his many precautions  he lost upwards of a
thousand pounds by roguery only last year 

i just stayed long enough to establish miss matty in her new mode of
life  and to pack up the library  which the rector had purchased   he
had written a very kind letter to miss matty  saying  how glad he should
be to take a library  so well selected as he knew that the late mr
jenkyns s must have been  at any valuation put upon them    and when she
agreed to this  with a touch of sorrowful gladness that they would go
back to the rectory and be arranged on the accustomed walls once more 
he sent word that he feared that he had not room for them all  and
perhaps miss matty would kindly allow him to leave some volumes on her
shelves   but miss matty said that she had her bible and  johnson s
dictionary   and should not have much time for reading  she was afraid 
still  i retained a few books out of consideration for the rector s
kindness 

the money which he had paid  and that produced by the sale  was partly
expended in the stock of tea  and part of it was invested against a
rainy day  i e   old age or illness   it was but a small sum  it is
true  and it occasioned a few evasions of truth and white lies  all of
which i think very wrong indeed in theory and would rather not put them
in practice   for we knew miss matty would be perplexed as to her duty
if she were aware of any little reserve fund being made for her while
the debts of the bank remained unpaid   moreover  she had never been
told of the way in which her friends were contributing to pay the rent 
i should have liked to tell her this  but the mystery of the affair gave
a piquancy to their deed of kindness which the ladies were unwilling to
give up  and at first martha had to shirk many a perplexed question as
to her ways and means of living in such a house  but by and by miss
matty s prudent uneasiness sank down into acquiescence with the existing
arrangement 

i left miss matty with a good heart   her sales of tea during the first
two days had surpassed my most sanguine expectations   the whole country
round seemed to be all out of tea at once   the only alteration i could
have desired in miss matty s way of doing business was  that she should
not have so plaintively entreated some of her customers not to buy green
tea running it down as a slow poison  sure to destroy the nerves  and
produce all manner of evil   their pertinacity in taking it  in spite of
all her warnings  distressed her so much that i really thought she would
relinquish the sale of it  and so lose half her custom  and i was driven
to my wits  end for instances of longevity entirely attributable to a
persevering use of green tea   but the final argument  which settled the
question  was a happy reference of mine to the train oil and tallow
candles which the esquimaux not only enjoy but digest   after that she
acknowledged that  one man s meat might be another man s poison   and
contented herself thence forward with an occasional remonstrance when
she thought the purchaser was too young and innocent to be acquainted
with the evil effects green tea produced on some constitutions  and an
habitual sigh when people old enough to choose more wisely would prefer
it 

i went over from drumble once a quarter at least to settle the accounts 
and see after the necessary business letters   and  speaking of letters 
i began to be very much ashamed of remembering my letter to the aga
jenkyns  and very glad i had never named my writing to any one   i only
hoped the letter was lost   no answer came   no sign was made 

about a year after miss matty set up shop  i received one of martha s
hieroglyphics  begging me to come to cranford very soon   i was afraid
that miss matty was ill  and went off that very afternoon  and took
martha by surprise when she saw me on opening the door   we went into
the kitchen as usual  to have our confidential conference  and then
martha told me she was expecting her confinement very soon in a week or
two  and she did not think miss matty was aware of it  and she wanted me
to break the news to her   for indeed  miss   continued martha  crying
hysterically   i m afraid she won t approve of it  and i m sure i don t
know who is to take care of her as she should be taken care of when i am
laid up  

i comforted martha by telling her i would remain till she was about
again  and only wished she had told me her reason for this sudden
summons  as then i would have brought the requisite stock of clothes 
but martha was so tearful and tender spirited  and unlike her usual
self  that i said as little as possible about myself  and endeavoured
rather to comfort martha under all the probable and possible misfortunes
which came crowding upon her imagination 

i then stole out of the house door  and made my appearance as if i were
a customer in the shop  just to take miss matty by surprise  and gain an
idea of how she looked in her new situation   it was warm may weather 
so only the little half door was closed  and miss matty sat behind the
counter  knitting an elaborate pair of garters  elaborate they seemed to
me  but the difficult stitch was no weight upon her mind  for she was
singing in a low voice to herself as her needles went rapidly in and
out  i call it singing  but i dare say a musician would not use that
word to the tuneless yet sweet humming of the low worn voice   i found
out from the words  far more than from the attempt at the tune  that it
was the old hundredth she was crooning to herself  but the quiet
continuous sound told of content  and gave me a pleasant feeling  as i
stood in the street just outside the door  quite in harmony with that
soft may morning   i went in   at first she did not catch who it was 
and stood up as if to serve me  but in another minute watchful pussy had
clutched her knitting  which was dropped in eager joy at seeing me   i
found  after we had had a little conversation  that it was as martha
said  and that miss matty had no idea of the approaching household
event   so i thought i would let things take their course  secure that
when i went to her with the baby in my arms  i should obtain that
forgiveness for martha which she was needlessly frightening herself into
believing that miss matty would withhold  under some notion that the new
claimant would require attentions from its mother that it would be
faithless treason to miss matty to render 

but i was right   i think that must be an hereditary quality  for my
father says he is scarcely ever wrong   one morning  within a week after
i arrived  i went to call miss matty  with a little bundle of flannel in
my arms   she was very much awestruck when i showed her what it was  and
asked for her spectacles off the dressing table  and looked at it
curiously  with a sort of tender wonder at its small perfection of
parts  she could not banish the thought of the surprise all day  but
went about on tiptoe  and was very silent   but she stole up to see
martha and they both cried with joy  and she got into a complimentary
speech to jem  and did not know how to get out of it again  and was only
extricated from her dilemma by the sound of the shop bell  which was an
equal relief to the shy  proud  honest jem  who shook my hand so
vigorously when i congratulated him  that i think i feel the pain of it
yet 

                    picture  i went to call miss matty 

i had a busy life while martha was laid up   i attended on miss matty 
and prepared her meals  i cast up her accounts  and examined into the
state of her canisters and tumblers   i helped her  too  occasionally 
in the shop  and it gave me no small amusement  and sometimes a little
uneasiness  to watch her ways there   if a little child came in to ask
for an ounce of almond comfits  and four of the large kind which miss
matty sold weighed that much   she always added one more by  way of
make weight   as she called it  although the scale was handsomely turned
before  and when i remonstrated against this  her reply was   the little
things like it so much    there was no use in telling her that the fifth
comfit weighed a quarter of an ounce  and made every sale into a loss to
her pocket   so i remembered the green tea  and winged my shaft with a
feather out of her own plumage   i told her how unwholesome
almond comfits were  and how ill excess in them might make the little
children   this argument produced some effect  for  henceforward 
instead of the fifth comfit  she always told them to hold out their tiny
palms  into which she shook either peppermint or ginger lozenges  as a
preventive to the dangers that might arise from the previous sale 
altogether the lozenge trade  conducted on these principles  did not
promise to be remunerative  but i was happy to find she had made more
than twenty pounds during the last year by her sales of tea  and 
moreover  that now she was accustomed to it  she did not dislike the
employment  which brought her into kindly intercourse with many of the
people round about   if she gave them good weight  they  in their turn 
brought many a little country present to the  old rector s daughter   a
cream cheese  a few new laid eggs  a little fresh ripe fruit  a bunch of
flowers   the counter was quite loaded with these offerings sometimes 
as she told me 

as for cranford in general  it was going on much as usual   the jamieson
and hoggins feud still raged  if a feud it could be called  when only
one side cared much about it   mr and mrs hoggins were very happy
together  and  like most very happy people  quite ready to be friendly 
indeed  mrs hoggins was really desirous to be restored to mrs jamieson s
good graces  because of the former intimacy   but mrs jamieson
considered their very happiness an insult to the glenmire family  to
which she had still the honour to belong  and she doggedly refused and
rejected every advance  mr mulliner  like a faithful clansman  espoused
his mistress  side with ardour   if he saw either mr or mrs hoggins  he
would cross the street  and appear absorbed in the contemplation of life
in general  and his own path in particular  until he had passed them by 
 miss pole used to amuse herself with wondering what in the world mrs
jamieson would do  if either she  or mr mulliner  or any other member of
her household was taken ill  she could hardly have the face to call in
mr hoggins after the way she had behaved to them   miss pole grew quite
impatient for some indisposition or accident to befall mrs jamieson or
her dependents  in order that cranford might see how she would act under
the perplexing circumstances 

martha was beginning to go about again  and i had already fixed a limit 
not very far distant  to my visit  when one afternoon  as i was sitting
in the shop parlour with miss matty i remember the weather was colder
now than it had been in may  three weeks before  and we had a fire and
kept the door fully closed we saw a gentleman go slowly past the window 
and then stand opposite to the door  as if looking out for the name
which we had so carefully hidden   he took out a double eyeglass and
peered about for some time before he could discover it   then he came
in   and  all on a sudden  it flashed across me that it was the aga
himself   for his clothes had an out of the way foreign cut about them 
and his face was deep brown  as if tanned and re tanned by the sun   his
complexion contrasted oddly with his plentiful snow white hair  his eyes
were dark and piercing  and he had an odd way of contracting them and
puckering up his cheeks into innumerable wrinkles when he looked
earnestly at objects  he did so to miss matty when he first came in 
his glance had first caught and lingered a little upon me  but then
turned  with the peculiar searching look i have described  to miss
matty   she was a little fluttered and nervous  but no more so than she
always was when any man came into her shop   she thought that he would
probably have a note  or a sovereign at least  for which she would have
to give change  which was an operation she very much disliked to
perform   but the present customer stood opposite to her  without asking
for anything  only looking fixedly at her as he drummed upon the table
with his fingers  just for all the world as miss jenkyns used to do 
miss matty was on the point of asking him what he wanted  as she told me
afterwards   when he turned sharp to me   is your name mary smith  

 yes   said i 

all my doubts as to his identity were set at rest  and i only wondered
what he would say or do next  and how miss matty would stand the joyful
shock of what he had to reveal   apparently he was at a loss how to
announce himself  for he looked round at last in search of something to
buy  so as to gain time  and  as it happened  his eye caught on the
almond comfits  and he boldly asked for a pound of  those things    i
doubt if miss matty had a whole pound in the shop  and  besides the
unusual magnitude of the order  she was distressed with the idea of the
indigestion they would produce  taken in such unlimited quantities   she
looked up to remonstrate   something of tender relaxation in his face
struck home to her heart   she said   it is oh  sir  can you be peter  
and trembled from head to foot   in a moment he was round the table and
had her in his arms  sobbing the tearless cries of old age   i brought
her a glass of wine  for indeed her colour had changed so as to alarm me
and mr peter too   he kept saying   i have been too sudden for you 
matty i have  my little girl  

i proposed that she should go at once up into the drawing room and lie
down on the sofa there   she looked wistfully at her brother  whose hand
she had held tight  even when nearly fainting  but on his assuring her
that he would not leave her  she allowed him to carry her upstairs 

i thought that the best i could do was to run and put the kettle on the
fire for early tea  and then to attend to the shop  leaving the brother
and sister to exchange some of the many thousand things they must have
to say   i had also to break the news to martha  who received it with a
burst of tears which nearly infected me   she kept recovering herself to
ask if i was sure it was indeed miss matty s brother  for i had
mentioned that he had grey hair  and she had always heard that he was a
very handsome young man   something of the same kind perplexed miss
matty at tea time  when she was installed in the great easy chair
opposite to mr jenkyns in order to gaze her fill   she could hardly
drink for looking at him  and as for eating  that was out of the
question 

 i suppose hot climates age people very quickly   said she  almost to
herself    when you left cranford you had not a grey hair in your head  

 but how many years ago is that   said mr peter  smiling 

 ah  true  yes  i suppose you and i are getting old   but still i did
not think we were so very old   but white hair is very becoming to you 
peter   she continued a little afraid lest she had hurt him by revealing
how his appearance had impressed her 

 i suppose i forgot dates too  matty  for what do you think i have
brought for you from india   i have an indian muslin gown and a pearl
necklace for you somewhere in my chest at portsmouth    he smiled as if
amused at the idea of the incongruity of his presents with the
appearance of his sister  but this did not strike her all at once  while
the elegance of the articles did   i could see that for a moment her
imagination dwelt complacently on the idea of herself thus attired  and
instinctively she put her hand up to her throat that little delicate
throat which  as miss pole had told me  had been one of her youthful
charms  but the hand met the touch of folds of soft muslin in which she
was always swathed up to her chin  and the sensation recalled a sense of
the unsuitableness of a pearl necklace to her age   she said   i m
afraid i m too old  but it was very kind of you to think of it   they
are just what i should have liked years ago when i was young  

 so i thought  my little matty   i remembered your tastes  they were so
like my dear mother s    at the mention of that name the brother and
sister clasped each other s hands yet more fondly  and  although they
were perfectly silent  i fancied they might have something to say if
they were unchecked by my presence  and i got up to arrange my room for
mr peter s occupation that night  intending myself to share miss matty s
bed   but at my movement  he started up    i must go and settle about a
room at the  george    my carpet bag is there too  

 no   said miss matty  in great distress  you must not go  please  dear
peter pray  mary oh  you must not go  

she was so much agitated that we both promised everything she wished 
peter sat down again and gave her his hand  which for better security
she held in both of hers  and i left the room to accomplish my
arrangements 

long  long into the night  far  far into the morning  did miss matty and
i talk   she had much to tell me of her brother s life and adventures 
which he had communicated to her as they had sat alone   she said all
was thoroughly clear to her  but i never quite understood the whole
story  and when in after days i lost my awe of mr peter enough to
question him myself  he laughed at my curiosity  and told me stories
that sounded so very much like baron munchausen s  that i was sure he
was making fun of me   what i heard from miss matty was that he had been
a volunteer at the siege of rangoon  had been taken prisoner by the
burmese  and somehow obtained favour and eventual freedom from knowing
how to bleed the chief of the small tribe in some case of dangerous
illness  that on his release from years of captivity he had had his
letters returned from england with the ominous word  dead  marked upon
them  and  believing himself to be the last of his race  he had settled
down as an indigo planter  and had proposed to spend the remainder of
his life in the country to whose inhabitants and modes of life he had
become habituated  when my letter had reached him  and  with the odd
vehemence which characterised him in age as it had done in youth  he had
sold his land and all his possessions to the first purchaser  and come
home to the poor old sister  who was more glad and rich than any
princess when she looked at him   she talked me to sleep at last  and
then i was awakened by a slight sound at the door  for which she begged
my pardon as she crept penitently into bed  but it seems that when i
could no longer confirm her belief that the long lost was really
here under the same roof she had begun to fear lest it was only a waking
dream of hers  that there never had been a peter sitting by her all that
blessed evening but that the real peter lay dead far away beneath some
wild sea wave  or under some strange eastern tree  and so strong had
this nervous feeling of hers become  that she was fain to get up and go
and convince herself that he was really there by listening through the
door to his even  regular breathing i don t like to call it snoring  but
i heard it myself through two closed doors and by and by it soothed miss
matty to sleep 

i don t believe mr peter came home from india as rich as a nabob  he
even considered himself poor  but neither he nor miss matty cared much
about that   at any rate  he had enough to live upon  very genteelly  at
cranford  he and miss matty together   and a day or two after his
arrival  the shop was closed  while troops of little urchins gleefully
awaited the shower of comfits and lozenges that came from time to time
down upon their faces as they stood up gazing at miss matty s
drawing room windows   occasionally miss matty would say to them
 half hidden behind the curtains    my dear children  don t make
yourselves ill   but a strong arm pulled her back  and a more rattling
shower than ever succeeded   a part of the tea was sent in presents to
the cranford ladies  and some of it was distributed among the old people
who remembered mr peter in the days of his frolicsome youth   the indian
muslin gown was reserved for darling flora gordon  miss jessie brown s
daughter    the gordons had been on the continent for the last few
years  but were now expected to return very soon  and miss matty  in her
sisterly pride  anticipated great delight in the joy of showing them mr
peter   the pearl necklace disappeared  and about that time many
handsome and useful presents made their appearance in the households of
miss pole and mrs forrester  and some rare and delicate indian ornaments
graced the drawing rooms of mrs jamieson and mrs fitz adam   i myself
was not forgotten   among other things  i had the handsomest bound and
best edition of dr johnson s works that could be procured  and dear miss
matty  with tears in her eyes  begged me to consider it as a present
from her sister as well as herself   in short  no one was forgotten 
and  what was more  every one  however insignificant  who had shown
kindness to miss matty at any time  was sure of mr peter s cordial
regard 




chapter xvi 
peace to cranford


it was not surprising that mr peter became such a favourite at cranford 
the ladies vied with each other who should admire him most  and no
wonder  for their quiet lives were astonishingly stirred up by the
arrival from india especially as the person arrived told more wonderful
stories than sindbad the sailor  and  as miss pole said  was quite as
good as an arabian night any evening   for my own part  i had vibrated
all my life between drumble and cranford  and i thought it was quite
possible that all mr peter s stories might be true  although wonderful 
but when i found that  if we swallowed an anecdote of tolerable
magnitude one week  we had the dose considerably increased the next  i
began to have my doubts  especially as i noticed that when his sister
was present the accounts of indian life were comparatively tame  not
that she knew more than we did  perhaps less   i noticed also that when
the rector came to call  mr peter talked in a different way about the
countries he had been in   but i don t think the ladies in cranford
would have considered him such a wonderful traveller if they had only
heard him talk in the quiet way he did to him   they liked him the
better  indeed  for being what they called  so very oriental  

one day  at a select party in his honour  which miss pole gave  and from
which  as mrs jamieson honoured it with her presence  and had even
offered to send mr mulliner to wait  mr and mrs hoggins and mrs
fitz adam were necessarily excluded one day at miss pole s  mr peter
said he was tired of sitting upright against the hard backed uneasy
chairs  and asked if he might not indulge himself in sitting
cross legged   miss pole s consent was eagerly given  and down he went
with the utmost gravity   but when miss pole asked me  in an audible
whisper   if he did not remind me of the father of the faithful   i
could not help thinking of poor simon jones  the lame tailor  and while
mrs jamieson slowly commented on the elegance and convenience of the
attitude  i remembered how we had all followed that lady s lead in
condemning mr hoggins for vulgarity because he simply crossed his legs
as he sat still on his chair   many of mr peter s ways of eating were a
little strange amongst such ladies as miss pole  and miss matty  and mrs
jamieson  especially when i recollected the untasted green peas and
two pronged forks at poor mr holbrook s dinner 

the mention of that gentleman s name recalls to my mind a conversation
between mr peter and miss matty one evening in the summer after he
returned to cranford   the day had been very hot  and miss matty had
been much oppressed by the weather  in the heat of which her brother
revelled  i remember that she had been unable to nurse martha s baby 
which had become her favourite employment of late  and which was as much
at home in her arms as in its mother s  as long as it remained a
light weight  portable by one so fragile as miss matty   this day to
which i refer  miss matty had seemed more than usually feeble and
languid  and only revived when the sun went down  and her sofa was
wheeled to the open window  through which  although it looked into the
principal street of cranford  the fragrant smell of the neighbouring
hayfields came in every now and then  borne by the soft breezes that
stirred the dull air of the summer twilight  and then died away   the
silence of the sultry atmosphere was lost in the murmuring noises which
came in from many an open window and door  even the children were abroad
in the street  late as it was  between ten and eleven   enjoying the
game of play for which they had not had spirits during the heat of the
day   it was a source of satisfaction to miss matty to see how few
candles were lighted  even in the apartments of those houses from which
issued the greatest signs of life   mr peter  miss matty  and i had all
been quiet  each with a separate reverie  for some little time  when mr
peter broke in 

 do you know  little matty  i could have sworn you were on the high road
to matrimony when i left england that last time   if anybody had told me
you would have lived and died an old maid then  i should have laughed in
their faces  

miss matty made no reply  and i tried in vain to think of some subject
which should effectually turn the conversation  but i was very stupid 
and before i spoke he went on 

 it was holbrook  that fine manly fellow who lived at woodley  that i
used to think would carry off my little matty   you would not think it
now  i dare say  mary  but this sister of mine was once a very pretty
girl at least  i thought so  and so i ve a notion did poor holbrook 
what business had he to die before i came home to thank him for all his
kindness to a good for nothing cub as i was   it was that that made me
first think he cared for you  for in all our fishing expeditions it was
matty  matty  we talked about   poor deborah   what a lecture she read
me on having asked him home to lunch one day  when she had seen the
arley carriage in the town  and thought that my lady might call   well 
that s long years ago  more than half a life time  and yet it seems like
yesterday   i don t know a fellow i should have liked better as a
brother in law   you must have played your cards badly  my little matty 
somehow or another wanted your brother to be a good go between  eh 
little one   said he  putting out his hand to take hold of hers as she
lay on the sofa    why  what s this  you re shivering and shaking 
matty  with that confounded open window   shut it  mary  this minute  

i did so  and then stooped down to kiss miss matty  and see if she
really were chilled   she caught at my hand  and gave it a hard
squeeze but unconsciously  i think for in a minute or two she spoke to
us quite in her usual voice  and smiled our uneasiness away  although
she patiently submitted to the prescriptions we enforced of a warm bed
and a glass of weak negus   i was to leave cranford the next day  and
before i went i saw that all the effects of the open window had quite
vanished   i had superintended most of the alterations necessary in the
house and household during the latter weeks of my stay   the shop was
once more a parlour  the empty resounding rooms again furnished up to
the very garrets 

there had been some talk of establishing martha and jem in another
house  but miss matty would not hear of this   indeed  i never saw her
so much roused as when miss pole had assumed it to be the most desirable
arrangement   as long as martha would remain with miss matty  miss matty
was only too thankful to have her about her  yes  and jem too  who was a
very pleasant man to have in the house  for she never saw him from
week s end to week s end   and as for the probable children  if they
would all turn out such little darlings as her god daughter  matilda 
she should not mind the number  if martha didn t   besides  the next was
to be called deborah a point which miss matty had reluctantly yielded to
martha s stubborn determination that her first born was to be matilda 
so miss pole had to lower her colours  and even her voice  as she said
to me that  as mr and mrs hearn were still to go on living in the same
house with miss matty  we had certainly done a wise thing in hiring
martha s niece as an auxiliary 

i left miss matty and mr peter most comfortable and contented  the only
subject for regret to the tender heart of the one  and the social
friendly nature of the other  being the unfortunate quarrel between mrs
jamieson and the plebeian hogginses and their following   in joke  i
prophesied one day that this would only last until mrs jamieson or mr
mulliner were ill  in which case they would only be too glad to be
friends with mr hoggins  but miss matty did not like my looking forward
to anything like illness in so light a manner  and before the year was
out all had come round in a far more satisfactory way 

i received two cranford letters on one auspicious october morning   both
miss pole and miss matty wrote to ask me to come over and meet the
gordons  who had returned to england alive and well with their two
children  now almost grown up   dear jessie brown had kept her old kind
nature  although she had changed her name and station  and she wrote to
say that she and major gordon expected to be in cranford on the
fourteenth  and she hoped and begged to be remembered to mrs jamieson
 named first  as became her honourable station   miss pole and miss
matty could she ever forget their kindness to her poor father and
sister  mrs forrester  mr hoggins  and here again came in an allusion to
kindness shown to the dead long ago   his new wife  who as such must
allow mrs gordon to desire to make her acquaintance  and who was 
moreover  an old scotch friend of her husband s   in short  every one
was named  from the rector who had been appointed to cranford in the
interim between captain brown s death and miss jessie s marriage  and
was now associated with the latter event down to miss betty barker   all
were asked to the luncheon  all except mrs fitz adam  who had come to
live in cranford since miss jessie brown s days  and whom i found rather
moping on account of the omission   people wondered at miss betty
barker s being included in the honourable list  but  then  as miss pole
said  we must remember the disregard of the genteel proprieties of life
in which the poor captain had educated his girls  and for his sake we
swallowed our pride   indeed  mrs jamieson rather took it as a
compliment  as putting miss betty  formerly  her  maid  on a level with
 those hogginses  

but when i arrived in cranford  nothing was as yet ascertained of mrs
jamieson s own intentions  would the honourable lady go  or would she
not   mr peter declared that she should and she would  miss pole shook
her head and desponded   but mr peter was a man of resources   in the
first place  he persuaded miss matty to write to mrs gordon  and to tell
her of mrs fitz adam s existence  and to beg that one so kind  and
cordial  and generous  might be included in the pleasant invitation   an
answer came back by return of post  with a pretty little note for mrs
fitz adam  and a request that miss matty would deliver it herself and
explain the previous omission   mrs fitz adam was as pleased as could
be  and thanked miss matty over and over again   mr peter had said 
 leave mrs jamieson to me   so we did  especially as we knew nothing
that we could do to alter her determination if once formed 

i did not know  nor did miss matty  how things were going on  until miss
pole asked me  just the day before mrs gordon came  if i thought there
was anything between mr peter and mrs jamieson in the matrimonial line 
for that mrs jamieson was really going to the lunch at the  george  
she had sent mr mulliner down to desire that there might be a footstool
put to the warmest seat in the room  as she meant to come  and knew that
their chairs were very high   miss pole had picked this piece of news
up  and from it she conjectured all sorts of things  and bemoaned yet
more   if peter should marry  what would become of poor dear miss matty 
 and mrs jamieson  of all people    miss pole seemed to think there were
other ladies in cranford who would have done more credit to his choice 
and i think she must have had someone who was unmarried in her head  for
she kept saying   it was so wanting in delicacy in a widow to think of
such a thing  

when i got back to miss matty s i really did begin to think that mr
peter might be thinking of mrs jamieson for a wife  and i was as unhappy
as miss pole about it   he had the proof sheet of a great placard in his
hand    signor brunoni  magician to the king of delhi  the rajah of
oude  and the great lama of thibet    c   c   was going to  perform in
cranford for one night only   the very next night  and miss matty 
exultant  showed me a letter from the gordons  promising to remain over
this gaiety  which miss matty said was entirely peter s doing   he had
written to ask the signor to come  and was to be at all the expenses of
the affair   tickets were to be sent gratis to as many as the room would
hold   in short  miss matty was charmed with the plan  and said that
to morrow cranford would remind her of the preston guild  to which she
had been in her youth a luncheon at the  george   with the dear gordons 
and the signor in the assembly room in the evening   but i i looked only
at the fatal words  

      under the patronage of the  honourable mrs jamieson  

she  then  was chosen to preside over this entertainment of mr peter s 
she was perhaps going to displace my dear miss matty in his heart  and
make her life lonely once more   i could not look forward to the morrow
with any pleasure  and every innocent anticipation of miss matty s only
served to add to my annoyance 

so  angry and irritated  and exaggerating every little incident which
could add to my irritation  i went on till we were all assembled in the
great parlour at the  george    major and mrs gordon and pretty flora
and mr ludovic were all as bright and handsome and friendly as could be 
but i could hardly attend to them for watching mr peter  and i saw that
miss pole was equally busy   i had never seen mrs jamieson so roused and
animated before  her face looked full of interest in what mr peter was
saying   i drew near to listen   my relief was great when i caught that
his words were not words of love  but that  for all his grave face  he
was at his old tricks   he was telling her of his travels in india  and
describing the wonderful height of the himalaya mountains  one touch
after another added to their size  and each exceeded the former in
absurdity  but mrs jamieson really enjoyed all in perfect good faith   i
suppose she required strong stimulants to excite her to come out of her
apathy   mr peter wound up his account by saying that  of course  at
that altitude there were none of the animals to be found that existed in
the lower regions  the game  everything was different   firing one day
at some flying creature  he was very much dismayed when it fell  to find
that he had shot a cherubim   mr peter caught my eye at this moment  and
gave me such a funny twinkle  that i felt sure he had no thoughts of mrs
jamieson as a wife from that time   she looked uncomfortably amazed 

 but  mr peter  shooting a cherubim don t you think i am afraid that was
sacrilege  

mr peter composed his countenance in a moment  and appeared shocked at
the idea  which  as he said truly enough  was now presented to him for
the first time  but then mrs jamieson must remember that he had been
living for a long time among savages all of whom were heathens some of
them  he was afraid  were downright dissenters   then  seeing miss matty
draw near  he hastily changed the conversation  and after a little
while  turning to me  he said   don t be shocked  prim little mary  at
all my wonderful stories   i consider mrs jamieson fair game  and
besides i am bent on propitiating her  and the first step towards it is
keeping her well awake   i bribed her here by asking her to let me have
her name as patroness for my poor conjuror this evening  and i don t
want to give her time enough to get up her rancour against the
hogginses  who are just coming in   i want everybody to be friends  for
it harasses matty so much to hear of these quarrels   i shall go at it
again by and by  so you need not look shocked   i intend to enter the
assembly room to night with mrs jamieson on one side  and my lady  mrs
hoggins  on the other   you see if i don t  

somehow or another he did  and fairly got them into conversation
together   major and mrs gordon helped at the good work with their
perfect ignorance of any existing coolness between any of the
inhabitants of cranford 

ever since that day there has been the old friendly sociability in
cranford society  which i am thankful for  because of my dear miss
matty s love of peace and kindliness   we all love miss matty  and i
somehow think we are all of us better when she is near us
