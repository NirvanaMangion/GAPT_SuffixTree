where love is there god is also


in the city lived the shoemaker  martuin avdyeitch  he lived in a
basement  in a little room with one window  the window looked out on the
street  through the window he used to watch the people passing by 
although only their feet could be seen  yet by the boots  martuin
avdyeitch recognized the people  martuin avdyeitch had lived long in one
place  and had many acquaintances  few pairs of boots in his district
had not been in his hands once and again  some he would half sole  some
he would patch  some he would stitch around  and occasionally he would
also put on new uppers  and through the window he often recognized his
work 

avdyeitch had plenty to do  because he was a faithful workman  used good
material  did not make exorbitant charges  and kept his word  if it was
possible for him to finish an order by a certain time  he would accept
it  otherwise  he would not deceive you   he would tell you so
beforehand  and all knew avdyeitch  and he was never out of work 

avdyeitch had always been a good man  but as he grew old  he began to
think more about his soul  and get nearer to god  martuin s wife had
died when he was still living with his master  his wife left him a boy
three years old  none of their other children had lived  all the eldest
had died in childhood  martuin at first intended to send his little son
to his sister in the village  but afterward he felt sorry for him  he
thought to himself   

 it will be hard for my kapitoshka to live in a strange family  i shall
keep him with me  

and avdyeitch left his master  and went into lodgings with his little
son  but god gave avdyeitch no luck with his children  as kapitoshka
grew older  he began to help his father  and would have been a delight
to him  but a sickness fell on him  he went to bed  suffered a week  and
died  martuin buried his son  and fell into despair  so deep was this
despair that he began to complain of god  martuin fell into such a
melancholy state  that more than once he prayed to god for death  and
reproached god because he had not taken him who was an old man  instead
of his beloved only son  avdyeitch also ceased to go to church 

and once a little old man from the same district came from tro tsa    to
see avdyeitch  for seven years he had been wandering about  avdyeitch
talked with him  and began to complain about his sorrows 

      trinity  a famous monastery  pilgrimage to which is reckoned a
  virtue  avdyeitch calls this  zemlyak starichok    bozhi chelovyek  
  god s man   ed 

 i have no desire to live any longer   he said   i only wish i was dead 
that is all i pray god for  i am a man without anything to hope for
now  

and the little old man said to him   

 you don t talk right  martuin  we must not judge god s doings  the
world moves  not by our skill  but by god s will  god decreed for your
son to die   for you  to live  so it is for the best  and you are in
despair  because you wish to live for your own happiness  

 but what shall one live for   asked martuin 

and the little old man said   

 we must live for god  martuin  he gives you life  and for his sake you
must live  when you begin to live for him  you will not grieve over
anything  and all will seem easy to you  

martuin kept silent for a moment  and then said   but how can one live
for god  

and the little old man said   

 christ has taught us how to live for god  you know how to read  buy a
testament  and read it  there you will learn how to live for god 
everything is explained there  

and these words kindled a fire in avdyeitch s heart  and he went that
very same day  bought a new testament in large print  and began to read 

at first avdyeitch intended to read only on holidays  but as he began to
read  it so cheered his soul that he used to read every day  at times he
would become so absorbed in reading  that all the kerosene in the lamp
would burn out  and still he could not tear himself away  and so
avdyeitch used to read every evening 

and the more he read  the clearer he understood what god wanted of him 
and how one should live for god  and his heart kept growing easier and
easier  formerly  when he lay down to sleep  he used to sigh and groan 
and always thought of his kapitoshka  and now his only exclamation
was   

 glory to thee  glory to thee  lord  thy will be done  

and from that time avdyeitch s whole life was changed  in other days he 
too  used to drop into a public house    as a holiday amusement  to
drink a cup of tea  and he was not averse to a little brandy  either  he
would take a drink with some acquaintance  and leave the saloon  not
intoxicated  exactly  yet in a happy frame of mind  and inclined to talk
nonsense  and shout  and use abusive language at a person  now he left
off that sort of thing  his life became quiet and joyful  in the morning
he would sit down to work  finish his allotted task  then take the
little lamp from the hook  put it on the table  get his book from the
shelf  open it  and sit down to read  and the more he read  the more he
understood  and the brighter and happier it grew in his heart 

       traktir  

once it happened that martuin read till late into the night  he was
reading the gospel of luke  he was reading over the sixth chapter  and
he was reading the verses   

  and unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other 
and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also 
give to every man that asketh of thee  and of him that taketh away thy
goods ask them not again  and as ye would that men should do to you  do
ye also to them likewise   

he read farther also those verses  where god speaks 

  and why call ye me  lord  lord  and do not the things which i say 
whosoever cometh to me  and heareth my sayings  and doeth them  i will
shew you to whom he is like  he is like a man which built an house  and
digged deep  and laid the foundation on a rock  and when the flood
arose  the stream beat vehemently upon that house  and could not shake
it  for it was founded upon a rock  but he that heareth  and doeth not 
is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth 
against which the stream did beat vehemently  and immediately it fell 
and the ruin of that house was great   

avdyeitch read these words  and joy filled his soul  he took off his
spectacles  put them down on the book  leaned his elbows on the table 
and became lost in thought  and he began to measure his life by these
words  and he thought to himself   

 is my house built on the rock  or on the sand   tis well if on the
rock  it is so easy when you are alone by yourself  it seems as if you
had done everything as god commands  but when you forget yourself  you
sin again  yet i shall still struggle on  it is very good  help me 
lord  

thus ran his thoughts  he wanted to go to bed  but he felt loath to tear
himself away from the book  and he began to read farther in the seventh
chapter  he read about the centurion  he read about the widow s son  he
read about the answer given to john s disciples  and finally he came to
that place where the rich pharisee desired the lord to sit at meat with
him  and he read how the woman that was a sinner anointed his feet  and
washed them with her tears  and how he forgave her  he reached the
forty fourth verse  and began to read   

  and he turned to the woman  and said unto simon  seest thou this
woman  i entered into thine house  thou gavest me no water for my feet 
but she hath washed my feet with tears  and wiped them with the hairs of
her head  thou gavest me no kiss  but this woman since the time i came
in hath not ceased to kiss my feet  my head with oil thou didst not
anoint  but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment   

he finished reading these verses  and thought to himself   

  thou gavest me no water for my feet  thou gavest me no kiss  my head
with oil thou didst not anoint   

and again avdyeitch took off his spectacles  put them down on the book 
and again he became lost in thought 

 it seems that pharisee must have been such a man as i am  i  too 
apparently have thought only of myself   how i might have my tea  be
warm and comfortable  but never to think about my guest  he thought
about himself  but there was not the least care taken of the guest  and
who was his guest  the lord himself  if he had come to me  should i have
done the same way  

avdyeitch rested his head upon both his arms  and did not notice that he
fell asleep 

 martuin   suddenly seemed to sound in his ears 

martuin started from his sleep   

 who is here  

he turned around  glanced toward the door  no one 

again he fell into a doze  suddenly  he plainly heard   

 martuin  ah  martuin  look to morrow on the street  i am coming  

martuin awoke  rose from the chair  began to rub his eyes  he himself
could not tell whether he heard those words in his dream  or in reality 
he turned down his lamp  and went to bed 

at daybreak next morning  avdyeitch rose  made his prayer to god 
lighted the stove  put on the shchi    and the kasha     put the water
in the samovar  put on his apron  and sat down by the window to work 

      cabbage soup 

      gruel 

and while he was working  he kept thinking about all that had happened
the day before  it seemed to him at one moment that it was a dream  and
now he had really heard a voice 

 well   he said to himself   such things have been  

martuin was sitting by the window  and looking out more than he was
working  when anyone passed by in boots which he did not know  he would
bend down  look out of the window  in order to see  not only the feet 
but also the face 

the dvornik    passed by in new felt boots     the water carrier passed
by  then there came up to the window an old soldier of nicholas s time 
in an old pair of laced felt boots  with a shovel in his hands 
avdyeitch recognized him by his felt boots  the old man s name was
stepanuitch  and a neighboring merchant  out of charity  gave him a home
with him  he was required to assist the dvornik  stepanuitch began to
shovel away the snow from in front of avdyeitch s window  avdyeitch
glanced at him  and took up his work again 

      house porter 

       valenki  

 pshaw  i must be getting crazy in my old age   said avdyeitch  and
laughed at himself   stepanuitch is clearing away the snow  and i
imagine that christ is coming to see me  i was entirely out of my mind 
old dotard that i am  

avdyeitch sewed about a dozen stitches  and then felt impelled to look
through the window again  he looked out again through the window  and
saw that stepanuitch had leaned his shovel against the wall  and was
warming himself  and resting  he was an old  broken down man  evidently
he had not strength enough even to shovel the snow  avdyeitch said to
himself   

 i will give him some tea  by the way  the samovar has only just gone
out   avdyeitch laid down his awl  rose from his seat  put the samovar
on the table  poured out the tea  and tapped with his finger at the
glass  stepanuitch turned around  and came to the window  avdyeitch
beckoned to him  and went to open the door 

 come in  warm yourself a little   he said   you must be cold  

 may christ reward you for this  my bones ache   said stepanuitch 

stepanuitch came in  and shook off the snow  tried to wipe his feet  so
as not to soil the floor  but staggered 

 don t trouble to wipe your feet  i will clean it up myself  we are used
to such things  come in and sit down   said avdyeitch   here  drink a
cup of tea  

and avdyeitch lifted two glasses  and handed one to his guest  while he
himself poured his tea into a saucer  and began to blow it 

stepanuitch finished drinking his glass of tea  turned the glass upside
down     put the half eaten lump of sugar on it  and began to express
his thanks  but it was evident he wanted some more 

      to signify he was satisfied  a custom among the russians   ed 

 have some more   said avdyeitch  filling both his own glass and his
guest s  avdyeitch drank his tea  but from time to time glanced out into
the street 

 are you expecting anyone   asked his guest 

 am i expecting anyone  i am ashamed even to tell whom i expect  i am 
and i am not  expecting someone  but one word has kindled a fire in my
heart  whether it is a dream  or something else  i do not know  don t
you see  brother  i was reading yesterday the gospel about christ the
batyushka  how he suffered  how he walked on the earth  i suppose you
have heard about it  

 indeed i have   replied stepanuitch   but we are people in darkness  we
can t read  

 well  now  i was reading about that very thing   how he walked on the
earth  i read  you know  how he came to the pharisee  and the pharisee
did not treat him hospitably  well  and so  my brother  i was reading
yesterday  about this very thing  and was thinking to myself how he did
not receive christ  the batyushka  with honor  suppose  for example  he
should come to me  or anyone else  i said to myself  i should not even
know how to receive him  and he gave him no reception at all  well 
while i was thus thinking  i fell asleep  brother  and i heard someone
call me by name  i got up  the voice  just as if someone whispered 
said   be on the watch  i shall come to morrow   and this happened
twice  well  would you believe it  it got into my head  i scolded
myself  and yet i am expecting him  the batyushka  

stepanuitch shook his head  and said nothing  he finished drinking his
glass of tea  and put it on the side  but avdyeitch picked up the glass
again  and filled it once more 

 drink some more for your good health  you see  i have an idea that 
when the batyushka went about on this earth  he disdained no one  and
had more to do with the simple people  he always went to see the simple
people  he picked out his disciples more from among folk like such
sinners as we are  from the working class  said he  whoever exalts
himself  shall be humbled  and he who is humbled shall become exalted 
said he  you call me lord  and  said he  i wash your feet  whoever
wishes  said he  to be the first  the same shall be a servant to all 
because  said he  blessed are the poor  the humble  the kind  the
generous  

and stepanuitch forgot about his tea  he was an old man  and easily
moved to tears  he was listening  and the tears rolled down his face 

 come  now  have some more tea   said avdyeitch  but stepanuitch made
the sign of the cross  thanked him  turned down his glass  and arose 

 thanks to you   he says   martuin avdyeitch  for treating me kindly 
and satisfying me  soul and body  

 you are welcome  come in again  always glad to see a friend   said
avdyeitch 

stepanuitch departed  and martuin poured out the rest of the tea  drank
it up  put away the dishes  and sat down again by the window to work  to
stitch on a patch  he kept stitching away  and at the same time looking
through the window  he was expecting christ  and was all the while
thinking of him and his deeds  and his head was filled with the
different speeches of christ 

two soldiers passed by  one wore boots furnished by the crown  and the
other one  boots that he had made  then the master    of the next house
passed by in shining galoshes  then a baker with a basket passed by  all
passed by  and now there came also by the window a woman in woolen
stockings and rustic bashmaks on her feet  she passed by the window  and
stood still near the window case 

       khozya n  

avdyeitch looked up at her from the window  and saw it was a stranger  a
woman poorly clad  and with a child  she was standing by the wall with
her back to the wind  trying to wrap up the child  and she had nothing
to wrap it up in  the woman was dressed in shabby summer clothes  and
from behind the frame  avdyeitch could hear the child crying  and the
woman trying to pacify it  but she was not able to pacify it 

avdyeitch got up  went to the door  ascended the steps  and cried   

 my good woman  hey  my good woman     

       umnitsa aumnitsa   literally  clever one 

the woman heard him and turned around 

 why are you standing in the cold with the child  come into my room 
where it is warm  you can manage it better  here  this way  

the woman was astonished  she saw an old  old man in an apron  with
spectacles on his nose  calling her to him  she followed him  they
descended the steps and entered the room  the old man led the woman to
his bed 

 there   says he   sit down  my good woman  nearer to the stove  you can
get warm  and nurse the little one  

 i have no milk for him  i myself have not eaten anything since
morning   said the woman  but  nevertheless  she took the baby to her
breast 

avdyeitch shook his head  went to the table  brought out the bread and a
dish  opened the oven door  poured into the dish some cabbage soup  took
out the pot with the gruel  but it was not cooked as yet  so he filled
the dish with shchi only  and put it on the table  he got the bread 
took the towel down from the hook  and spread it upon the table 

 sit down   he says   and eat  my good woman  and i will mind the little
one  you see  i once had children of my own  i know how to handle them  

the woman crossed herself  sat down at the table  and began to eat 
while avdyeitch took a seat on the bed near the infant  avdyeitch kept
smacking and smacking to it with his lips  but it was a poor kind of
smacking  for he had no teeth  the little one kept on crying  and it
occured to avdyeitch to threaten the little one with his finger  he
waved  waved his finger right before the child s mouth  and hastily
withdrew it  he did not put it to its mouth  because his finger was
black  and soiled with wax  and the little one looked at his finger  and
became quiet  then it began to smile  and avdyeitch also was glad  while
the woman was eating  she told who she was  and whither she was going 

said she   

 i am a soldier s wife  it is now seven months since they sent my
husband away off  and no tidings  i lived out as cook  the baby was
born  no one cared to keep me with a child  this is the third month that
i have been struggling along without a place  i ate up all i had  i
wanted to engage as a wet nurse  no one would take me  i am too thin 
they say  i have just been to the merchant s wife  where lives a young
woman i know  and so they promised to take us in  i thought that was the
end of it  but she told me to come next week  and she lives a long way
off  i got tired out  and it tired him  too  my heart s darling 
fortunately  our landlady takes pity on us for the sake of christ  and
gives us a room  else i don t know how i should manage to get along  

avdyeitch sighed  and said 

 haven t you any warm clothes  

 now is the time  friend  to wear warm clothes  but yesterday i pawned
my last shawl for a twenty kopek piece      

        dvagrivennui   silver  worth sixteen cents 

the woman came to the bed  and took the child  and avdyeitch rose  went
to the partition  rummaged round  and succeeded in finding an old coat 

 na   says he   it is a poor thing  yet you may turn it to some use  

the woman looked at the coat and looked at the old man  she took the
coat  and burst into tears  and avdyeitch turned away his head  crawling
under the bed  he pushed out a little trunk  rummaged in it  and sat
down again opposite the woman 

and the woman said   

 may christ bless you  little grandfather      he must have sent me to
your window  my little baby would have frozen to death  when i started
out it was warm  but now it has grown cold  and he  the batyushka  led
you to look through the window and take pity on me  an unfortunate  

        diedushka  

avdyeitch smiled  and said   

 indeed  he did that  i have been looking through the window  my good
woman  for some wise reason  

and martuin told the soldier s wife his dream  and how he heard the
voice   how the lord promised to come and see him that day 

 all things are possible   said the woman  she rose  put on the coat 
wrapped up her little child in it  and  as she started to take leave 
she thanked avdyeitch again 

 take this  for christ s sake   said avdyeitch  giving her a
twenty kopek piece   redeem your shawl  

she made the sign of the cross  and avdyeitch made the sign of the cross
and went with her to the door 

the woman went away  avdyeitch ate some shchi  washed the dishes  and
sat down again to work  while he was working he still remembered the
window  when the window grew darker he immediately looked out to see who
was passing by  acquaintances passed by and strangers passed by  and
there was nothing out of the ordinary 

but here avdyeitch saw that an old apple woman had stopped in front of
his window  she carried a basket with apples  only a few were left  as
she had evidently sold them nearly all out  and over her shoulder she
had a bag full of chips  she must have gathered them up in some new
building  and was on her way home  one could see that the bag was heavy
on her shoulder  she tried to shift it to the other shoulder  so she
lowered the bag on the sidewalk  stood the basket with the apples on a
little post  and began to shake down the splinters in the bag  and while
she was shaking her bag  a little boy in a torn cap came along  picked
up an apple from the basket  and was about to make his escape  but the
old woman noticed it  turned around  and caught the youngster by his
sleeve  the little boy began to struggle  tried to tear himself away 
but the old woman grasped him with both hands  knocked off his cap  and
caught him by the hair 

the little boy was screaming  the old woman was scolding  avdyeitch lost
no time in putting away his awl  he threw it upon the floor  sprang to
the door   he even stumbled on the stairs  and dropped his
spectacles   and rushed out into the street 

the old woman was pulling the youngster by his hair  and was scolding
and threatening to take him to the policeman  the youngster was
defending himself  and denying the charge 

 i did not take it   he said   what are you licking me for  let me go  

avdyeitch tried to separate them  he took the boy by his arm  and
said   

 let him go  babushka  forgive him  for christ s sake  

 i will forgive him so that he won t forget it till the new broom grows 
i am going to take the little villain to the police  

avdyeitch began to entreat the old woman   

 let him go  babushka   he said   he will never do it again  let him go 
for christ s sake  

the old woman let him loose  the boy started to run  but avdyeitch kept
him back 

 ask the babushka s forgiveness   he said   and don t you ever do it
again  i saw you take the apple  

the boy burst into tears  and began to ask forgiveness 

 there now  that s right  and here s an apple for you  

and avdyeitch took an apple from the basket  and gave it to the boy 

 i will pay you for it  babushka   he said to the old woman 

 you ruin them that way  the good for nothings   said the old woman   he
ought to be treated so that he would remember it for a whole week  

 eh  babushka  babushka   said avdyeitch   that is right according to
our judgment  but not according to god s  if he is to be whipped for an
apple  then what ought to be done to us for our sins  

the old woman was silent 

and avdyeitch told her the parable of the master who forgave a debtor
all that he owed him  and how the debtor went and began to choke one who
owed him 

the old woman listened  and the boy stood listening 

 god has commanded us to forgive   said avdyeitch   else we  too  may
not be forgiven  all should be forgiven  and the thoughtless
especially  

the old woman shook her head  and sighed 

 that s so   said she   but the trouble is that they are very much
spoiled  

 then we who are older must teach them   said avdyeitch 

 that s just what i say   remarked the old woman   i myself have had
seven of them   only one daughter is left  

and the old woman began to relate where and how she lived with her
daughter  and how many grandchildren she had   here   she says   my
strength is only so so  and yet i have to work  i pity the
youngsters  my grandchildren  but what nice children they are  no one
gives me such a welcome as they do  aksintka won t go to anyone but me 
 babushka  dear babushka  lovliest   

and the old woman grew quite sentimental 

 of course  it is a childish trick  god be with him   said she  pointing
to the boy 

the woman was just about to lift the bag up on her shoulder  when the
boy ran up  and said   

 let me carry it  babushka  it is on my way  

the old woman nodded her head  and put the bag on the boy s back 

and side by side they passed along the street 

and the old woman even forgot to ask avdyeitch to pay for the apple 
avdyeitch stood motionless  and kept gazing after them  and he heard
them talking all the time as they walked away  after avdyeitch saw them
disappear  he returned to his room  he found his eye glasses on the
stairs   they were not broken  he picked up his awl  and sat down to
work again 

after working a little while  it grew darker  so that he could not see
to sew  he saw the lamplighter passing by to light the street lamps 

 it must be time to make a light   he said to himself  so he got his
little lamp ready  hung it up  and he took himself again to his work  he
had one boot already finished  he turned it around  looked at it   well
done   he put away his tools  swept off the cuttings  cleared off the
bristles and ends  took the lamp  set it on the table  and took down the
gospels from the shelf  he intended to open the book at the very place
where he had yesterday put a piece of leather as a mark  but it happened
to open at another place  and the moment avdyeitch opened the testament 
he recollected his last night s dream  and as soon as he remembered it 
it seemed as if he heard someone stepping about behind him  avdyeitch
looked around  and saw  there  in the dark corner  it seemed as if
people were standing  he was at a loss to know who they were  and a
voice whispered in his ear   

 martuin  ah  martuin  did you not recognize me  

 who   exclaimed avdyeitch 

 me   repeated the voice   it was i   and stepanuitch stepped forth from
the dark corner  he smiled  and like a little cloud faded away  and soon
vanished 

 and it was i   said the voice 

from the dark corner stepped forth the woman with her child  the woman
smiled  the child laughed  and they also vanished 

 and it was i   continued the voice  both the old woman and the boy with
the apple stepped forward  both smiled and vanished 

avdyeitch s soul rejoiced  he crossed himself  put on his spectacles 
and began to read the evangelists where it happened to open  on the
upper part of the page he read   

  for i was an hungered  and ye gave me meat  i was thirsty  and ye gave
me drink  i was a stranger  and ye took me in   

and on the lower part of the page he read this   

  inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my
brethren  ye have done it unto me     st  matthew  chap  xxv 

and avdyeitch understood that his dream had not deceived him  that the
saviour really called on him that day  and that he really received him
