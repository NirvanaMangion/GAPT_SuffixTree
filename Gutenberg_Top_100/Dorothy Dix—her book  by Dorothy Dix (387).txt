 dorothy dix her book 

a foreword by richard duffy


to the accurately estimated millions of readers who are familiar with
dorothy dix s understanding and interpretation of the plain facts
of everyday life and also its enigmas  it may appear a presumption
that one should attempt a foreword of explanation to make clear why a
choice of her daily contributions to the press  not only in the united
states and canada  but also in farther regions of the world  should
be deemed worthy of the more permanent shelter of book covers  but it
becomes at once justifiable when we try to present a true account of
the work of  the little lady of new orleans   as one of her oldest
editors calls her  she herself confesses that  among the hundreds of
letters she receives each day from men and women  young  adult and
aged  there recur the questions   are you a real person  or only a
newspaper syndicate name    are you a man  or are you a woman    are
you married or single    have you ever been married    if you have not
been married  would you marry    if you have been married and are not
now would you marry again    have you any children  if so are they
boys or girls and how many   it must be emphasized that the questions
above recorded are not asked by correspondents merely curious  who put
the questions just to probe the author of the dorothy dix articles 
not at all  these questions are asked in letters revealing the puzzles
of life that entangle the very writers who address dorothy dix  before
they make the simplest inquiry as to the trustworthiness of dorothy
dix  they tell their own troubles in the way we all have of saying 
 of course what i have said to you is wholly confidential  now let me
know where you stand i mean about absolute personal fidelity   to a
hard boiled business man  or business woman  such a remark seems trite 
yet  we must remember that hard boiled business persons run to the
courts every so often to discover between themselves  at great expense 
how personal fidelity  in gush and in fact  sharply contrast 

the self styled hard boiled people and the people who pretend they
are less sophisticated than they are  look to dorothy dix for a way
out of all their troubles  these two classes are to be reckoned with 
because they are always telling their troubles to some confidant the
less known  the better  but the vast majority of the people who write
to dorothy dix for counsel and guidance are profoundly sincere and
earnest  not so much because they fear to be otherwise  but because
they are so firmly persuaded of the sincerity and earnestness of life
itself  when they look it square in the face and without pose of any
kind  all and any of these correspondents of dorothy dix are struggling
with their problems of how to make life livable  in the case of the
young woman who has a good job and  at the same time  has a good home
with her parents  the question arises whether she should marry the man
she likes  and who on his part likes her  and then undertake to become
a parent herself without a salaried job and without the safeguard
of the home provided by her father and mother  on the other side
there appears the problem of the young man  who would marry  but for
responsibilities  psychological as well as financial  that make him
stop  look and listen before he leaves a dependent father and mother
unsupported 

we pass to the men and women who are actually married and suddenly
discover that they are facing the real and inevitable conflict of life
at home as compared with the daily battle of the business world  some
husbands are go getters  but they do not get anywhere because their
wives are shiftless as home managers  or because they are spendthrifts 
and would always  without trying  spend twice as much money as any
husband has  or can earn  some wives are the best of helpmates  but are
linked to husbands who simply cannot or will not achieve the quiet
fame of a weekly pay envelope which is the rock foundation of  home
sweet home  

some wives are afflicted with the disease of  social climbing   they
spend their days and nights proving to their husbands that for every
dollar earned  it is better to spend two dollars  in order to take a
chance at three  by inviting the smiths to the theatre and to supper
afterward  such wives usually overlook the fact that the smiths  with
whom they would curry favor at great expense  are themselves spending
two dollars for every one dollar gained on the principle that it is a
good investment to obtain equal social standing with the joneses 

also to be encountered in this book are the varied specimens of
husbands and wives who have become tired of each other and seek from
dorothy dix guidance towards a way out of what they consider the
morass of marriage  then  too  we meet the father  or the mother  who
is perplexed about the way children grow up nowadays as tho the way
children grew up has not always been a surprise to parents since the
days of romulus and remus  to sum up  all  dramatis person   in the
stupendous play of life  being enacted day in and day out  as we live 
are brought on the world s stage before us  not so much by dorothy
dix as by themselves in the confidences they repose in her and the
disclosures they make about themselves 

despite this fact there never has been nor will there be anything
merely approaching a betrayal of confidence by dorothy dix  she talks
to the whole world of men and women  and their worries and concerns are
so alike that all shadow of individual identity is lost  she talks to
them  not from the pedestal of the highbrow  but from the average level
of a human being  who herself has fought the grim battle of life as may
be learned from her personal statement  which immediately follows these
pages  one of the most distinguished of living american novelists  on
being shown a few letters in her day s mail  asked 

 how many such letters do you receive a month  

she replied   it takes me from three to four hours each day to answer
my correspondents and then i have to write my articles besides  

 great scott   exclaimed the novelist   you have more plots in a day s
letters than any hard working novelist could invent in a year  

but none of these potential plots is available even for the most
prolific of story writers  because they are not  plots  to dorothy dix 
but sacred testimonies to the help the  little lady of new orleans  has
been able to render through many years to her ever increasing number of
friends and confidants 




 introduction 




 introduction 

my philosophy of life


i have had what people call a hard life  i have been through the depths
of poverty and sickness  i have known want and struggle and anxiety and
despair  i have always had to work beyond the limit of my strength 

as i look back upon my life  i see it as a battlefield strewn with the
wrecks of dead dreams and broken hopes and shattered illusions a battle
in which i always fought with the odds tremendously against me  and
which has left me scarred and bruised and maimed and old before my time 

yet i have no pity for myself  no tears to shed over the past and gone
sorrows  no envy for the women who have been spared all that i have
gone through 

for i have lived  they have only existed  i have drunk the cup of life
down to the very dregs  they have only sipped at the bubbles on the top
of it 

i know things they will never know  i see things to which they are
blind  it is only the women whose eyes have been washed clear with
tears who get the broad vision that makes them little sisters to all
the world 

this of itself is a compensation for many sorrows  but i have more  i
have proved myself to myself  i know that i have the strength to endure
and the courage to carry on  and that i will not be craven enough to
run up the white flag  no matter what other difficulties i may be
called upon to meet 

the skeleton at the feast of the woman who has always been happy and
prosperous is fear  she becomes panic stricken when she thinks that
she may be called upon to meet trouble  that she may have hardships
to endure  that her soul may be torn with suffering  she suffers
with apprehension at the thought of poverty  and wonders how she
could endure to go shabby and do without the things to which she is
accustomed  she wonders helplessly what she would do if she had to earn
her own living 

 i am not afraid of poverty  because i have been poor and i know that
poverty has its consolations and brings you pleasures that money cannot
buy  nor am i afraid to support myself  i have earned my bread and
butter for many years  i know the joy of work and i know that to a
woman  just the satisfaction of knowing that she is self supporting
turns her crust into angel s food 

none of the fears with which happy women torture themselves upon
occasion have any terrors for me  i know them for the bogies they are 
and know  too  that they fly away before the person who does not cringe
before them 

often i am tempted to envy the woman who has always had some strong
man to stand between her and the world  some man whose tenderness and
love has guarded and protected her  but i am consoled for not being a
clinging vine when i wonder what the vine would do and think how broken
it would be if the sturdy oak on which it hangs were laid low 

i have learned in the great university of hard knocks a philosophy that
no woman who has had an easy life ever acquires  i have learned to live
each day as it comes  and not to borrow trouble by dreading to morrow 
it is the dark menace of the future that makes cowards of us  i put
that dread from me because experience has taught me that when the time
comes that i so fear  the strength and wisdom to meet it will be given
me 

little annoyances have no longer the power to affect me  after you have
seen your whole edifice of happiness topple and crash in ruins about
you  it never matters to you again that a servant forgets to put the
doilies under the finger bowls or the cook spills the soup 

i have learned not to expect too much of people and so i can still
get happiness out of the friend who isn t quite true to me  or the
acquaintance who gossips about me  and i can even find pleasure in the
society of those whose motives i see through 

above all i have acquired a sense of humor  because there were so many
things over which i had either to laugh or cry  and when a woman can
joke over her troubles instead of having hysterics  nothing can ever
hurt her much again 

so i do not regret the hardships i have known because through them i
have touched life at every point  i have lived  and it was worth the
price i had to pay

how a husband likes to be treated


altho marriage has been the chief business of woman since eve
pulled off the first wedding in the garden of eden  women have not
yet mastered the first indispensable principle of success in their
profession  millions of women have been married  hundreds of thousands
of women marry annually  and yet  as a class  women do not know how to
treat a husband 

here and there is a shining exception to this rule  and the result is
an inspiring picture of domestic bliss  but the great majority of women
still go stumbling along into misery and divorce because they have not
had the wit to find out how to rub man s fur the right way  and make
him purr under their hands 

in a word  women fail to strike just the right note in their attitude
towards their husbands  sometimes they treat them better than they
deserve  sometimes worse  but seldom do they treat the men just as the
men would like to be treated 

perhaps the real reason that women fail in this most important
particular is because they make the mistake of treating a husband as
if he were a rational human being  and the same sort of an individual
inside of the home circle that he is outside of it 

never was there a greater error  the john smith to whom a woman is
married is no more the john smith of the business world than he is some
other man 

the john smith  who is a lawyer  or a doctor  or a grocer in the
outer world  is a big  strong  broad  self reliant man who looks at
everything in a large way  and is just  and tolerant  and even stoical
in meeting the vicissitudes of life  the woman who marries him has
perceived all of these qualities  and loved him for them  and she
naturally expects him to exhibit these characteristics in home life 

fatal blunder  john smith  the business man  may be dealt with on a
plain  sensible  aboveboard platform  but john smith the husband  has
to be jollied  and cajoled  and petted  and wheedled along the road he
should go  if there is anything doing in the domestic felicity line in
the household of which he is the alleged head 

now the majority of husbands average up quite as well as the majority
of wives  but even when a man is really good  and true  and strong 
experience teaches his wife that there are three ways in which he likes
her to treat him  they are 

 a  like a baby 

 b  like a demigod 

 c  like a good fellow 

no matter how big and strong a man is  nor how many other men he
bosses  he wants his wife to treat him as if he were a delicate infant
who had to be petted  and nursed  and dandled  and chucked under the
chin  there isn t a man living whose secret ideal of a perfect wife
isn t a woman who puts the buttons in his shirt  and lays out his
collar and tie in the morning  who has his slippers toasting on the
radiator when he comes home of an evening  and who cooks just the
particular thing he likes to eat  with her own hands

produce your living pictures  exhibit your paragons of virtue  they are
simply not one  two  three with the wise dame who pets and fusses over
her lord and master  and it isn t because the man really wants his wife
to wait on him  that doesn t enter into it at all  he s just like the
three year old who howls for mama to put on his shoes or butter his
bread when there are seven nurses standing around to do it 

men are babyish in wanting their wives to show them off  the
expression on the face of little tommy while his fond mother is telling
the smart things that he said  is exactly the same expression that
is on tommy s father s face while his wife is bragging about how he
organized a trust  or won a big lawsuit  or was elected judge 

wise  oh  a daughter of solomon is the woman who puts her husband
through his paces for the benefit of company  matrimony is one long 
glad sweet song in the household of the lady who acts as a showman for
hubby 

consider also a man when he is sick  or thinks he is sick  how does he
want to be treated then  like a baby  he wants his wife to sit by his
bed  and hold his hand  and weep tears of sympathy  and if she doesn t
believe he is going to die every time he has a headache  he considers
her a cold  heartless icicle and doubts her affection 

therefore  the very first principle in treating a husband is to treat
him as if he was your littlest baby  and if you do  he will gurgle  and
coo just as your two year old does when you smother him with kisses 
and asks    oose de most booflest boy on earf  an  mudders itty  pitty
wonder  and world beater  

secondly  every husband likes to be treated as if he were a demigod 

men won t admit it  but in his soul every husband feels that he has
conferred such an inestimable boon upon his wife by marrying her that
she can never really repay him  anyway  but that it is up to her
to keep busy on the job  therefore  the least she can do is to act
grateful 

the real reason why there is a continual conflict in most families over
the money question is not because husbands are stingy  but because a
man likes to dole the money out  piece by piece  so that the woman who
gets it may have a living exhibition of his generosity 

when a man complains about how extravagant his wife is  and how much
her hat and dress cost  it doesn t mean that he begrudges her a single
garment or the price thereof  on the contrary  it is his way of
boasting to the world of how prosperous he is  and how well he provides
for his family  stupid  indeed  is the woman who does not comprehend
this  and who does not keep her glad rags hanging in public  so to
speak  and continually beat upon the cymbal  and chant p ans of praise
about how good her husband is to provide her with her lovely clothes 

nor is this as silly as it sounds  the average man gets practically
nothing out of his labor  after he has supported his family  but his
board and clothes  and it is pretty discouraging to spend your life
toiling for those who take all that you can give  and make no sign of
appreciation in return  so it is not strange that husbands like their
wives to treat them as a beneficent providence from whom all blessings
flow 

husbands like to be treated as good fellows 

if the average married man could put up one prayer more fervent than
all the rest it would be this   lord  send me a wife who laughs  and a
home that isn t an understudy to a funeral parlor  

but his prayer isn t often answered 

now one of the great reasons why so many husbands and wives make
shipwreck of their lives together is because a man is always seeking
for happiness  while a woman is on a perpetual still hunt for trouble 
when anything uncomfortable happens to a man he tries to forget it 
to put it behind him  to get it out of his thoughts  even if he has
to drown it in drink  when a misfortune befalls a woman she gloats
over it  she keeps pressing her finger on every sore until she makes a
raging abscess of it  then she goes on a jag of tears 

the result of this feminine peculiarity is that the average home is not
a cheerful place  nor is the average wife a joyous companion  and that
is why a very large number of husbands seek their amusements elsewhere 
and with other people  the greatest danger that menaces domesticity is
that so many wives are killjoys 

the question is often asked why do men  who are penurious and niggardly
to their families  and who never pay a household bill without
grumbling  spend money so lavishly on their vices  the answer is easy 
a man s home is dull  and the money that his family costs him gives
him no fillip of pleasure  the other does  the home has been made to
mean to him nothing but hard duty  ungilded by any joy  the opening
of champagne for chorus girls is to the tune of gaiety and laughter 
therefore  he is willing to pay for one and begrudges paying for the
other 

once i was listening to a group of intelligent people discuss the most
desirable quality in a wife  they named the usual standard virtues
until suddenly one man burst out in a voice surcharged with genuine
emotion 

 i tell you   he said   what a man wants in a wife more than anything
else is a cheerful companion  goodness  bah  all women  at least the
kind a man marries  are good  economy  a man likes to spend money
on his wife  amiability  who wants a simpering doll always about 
domesticity  stuff and nonsense  a man s stomach isn t the most
important part of him  besides there is a good restaurant on every
corner  if he is bound to gorge himself on food 

 i tell you what a man wants is cheerfulness in his wife  he wants to
come home at night to somebody who will meet him with a smile  somebody
who has got a lot of bright little things to tell him  and who can make
him laugh  somebody who is willing to put on her prettiest dress and
go out with him if he wants to go to any place of amusement 

 he doesn t want to come home to a woman who is sodden with tears 
or who is running over with the accumulated worries of the day that
she dumps on him  who is full of her own and other people s hard luck
stories  and who looks like a chapter of the lamentations of jeremiah  

of course  whether a wife is melancholy or not does not  from an
ethical standpoint  alter her husband s duty to her  he should be
strong enough to love and cherish her no matter how lacrimose she
is  but the martyr s crown is a piece of headgear that is distinctly
unfashionable at the present time  and most men duck wearing it 
wherefore  it behooves the amalgamated order of doleful wives to
cheer up  and try to be more lively companions to their husbands if
they don t want those gentlemen to stray off in search of ladies with
sunnier dispositions 

as a matter of fact  men are  emotionally  very primitive creatures
with a few simple domestic wants  they desire to be petted  and
jollied  and looked up to by their wives  and then they want to be
treated as good fellows  they want their wives to be chums with them 
and not reforming institutions  or lecture bureaus 

the average man simply pines for cheerful comradeship from his wife 
he wants her to enjoy the things that he does  to like the people he
likes  to amuse herself with the things that divert him  he wants to
hear her laugh  to see her eyes sparkle  and for her to treat him as
on a par with herself  as if they were joyous fellow sinners together 
instead of her being a living reproof to him as a poor low browed
creature  with musical comedy tastes that make her shudder 

yet do you ever notice the ordinary married couple out together  it
is one of the most piteous sights on earth  the man is spending his
money trying to give his wife a good time  and she meets his noble
efforts with the rasping qualities of a crosscut saw  that is what
gives eternal pungency to the old weber and fields joke about the man
who  when asked if he was going to take his wife with him on a trip to
paris  replied   no  i am going on a pleasure excursion  

of course whether it is any more a woman s place to get along with her
husband than it is his to get along with her is another fight  which i
am not trying to referee here  so also is the question of how a wife
likes to be treated  what i have tried to show is how a husband would
like his wife to pull the wool over his eyes and put on the velvet
glove before she tries to manage him because men really enjoy being
bamboozled by women who turn out a nice artistic job  what they object
to is not being henpecked  but the raw way in which their wives do it

charm


over and over again girls ask me these questions  what is charm  what
is the secret of the attraction that some women have for men 

what is the  come hither  look in the eye that some women have that
makes every man who beholds it get up and follow them 

why do some girls always have hosts of beaux flocking about them  while
other girls just as good looking  just as clever  just as good dancers 
just as anxious to please  never have a date or a single sweetheart to
bless themselves with 

and to all of these questions i have to answer  sadly and
disconsolately  that i do not know  i have to give up the conundrum 
which is perhaps the riddle that the sphinx  who is partly a woman  has
brooded over through the centuries in her desert solitude  without ever
being able to solve it 

in barrie s delightful play   what every woman knows   maggie s
brothers  discussing her with the brutal frankness with which brothers
approach the subject of a sister  agreed that she wasn t young  nor
brilliant  and that she was homely  yet all the men were after her 
finally one of the brothers said   but she s got that damned charm  
and that was that 

when a woman has that damned charm she can snap her fingers in the face
of flappers and living pictures  and marry as early and as often as she
pleases as is witnessed by the many fat  pie faced women we all know
who have had two  and three  or more  husbands apiece  and who still
have a waiting list in case anything untoward and fatal should happen
to the gentlemen to whom they are at present united in the holy bonds
of matrimony 

but what is this charm  what is this rabbit s foot that some lucky
women carry  and others do not  to say that it is personality is to
attempt to explain one mystery by another mystery  for we do not know
in what personal magnetism consists  or by what power one individual
draws us  while another repulses us 

we know that it isn t beauty  because the best lookers among girls
are seldom the most popular  and men who profess to worship beauty
are generally content to adore it from a safe distance  and show no
disposition to marry it  it is notorious that beauties seldom make good
matches  nor does charm consist of intelligence  being a highbrow booms
no woman s stock  socially or matrimonially  while a witty woman cuts
her throat with her own tongue 

to be a spellbinder is for a girl s fairy godmother to have wished a
curse instead of a blessing upon her  for no woman is more anathema to
men than the human phonograph  even dancing  chief of accomplishments
in these jazzy days when it is of more profit for a woman to have her
brains in her heels than in her head  is but a passing attraction 
while amiability and a sweet nature  woman s traditional one best bet 
are like a sticking plaster  potent to hold a man after marriage  but
of small value in luring him into it 

undoubtedly  charm in its perfection is a gift of the gods  but
happily  in these days  when nature proves a cruel stepmother who is so
mean and stingy that she does not give us all that is coming to us  we
have learned to circumvent the lady  no woman need be as ugly as god
made her  nor as unattractive as she was born  drug store complexions
can put the inherited ones to the blush  and any girl who is willing to
take the trouble can acquire a line of lures and graces that will make
any bona fide siren tremble for her job  to the girl  then  who wishes
to acquire charm  and who especially wishes to attract men  i would
say  first  stress your femininity 

i don t mean be namby pamby and weepy and dish raggy  without any
backbone  that type of woman has gone out of fashion as completely as
bustles and hoopskirts  no man now would be bored with the sort of
perfect lady his grandmother was  but the eternal feminine remains
still the eternal attraction for men  and the more womanly a woman is 
the gentler  the tenderer  the sweeter  the more she appeals to men  if
you will notice when a man speaks of the woman he loves  he invariably
calls her  little  no matter if she is six feet high and weighs    
pounds  what he means is that she gives him the reaction of depending
upon him  of looking up to him  and that in some subtle way she
flatters his vanity by giving him the sense of masculine superiority 

you never see an aggressive  double fisted woman  who fights her way
as a man does  get anywhere  and in his soul every man adores frills
and furbelows  and likes to see women dolled up  that is why girls make
such a terrible mistake when they ape mannish ways  and wear mannish
clothes  when a girl puts on knickerbockers she throws her trump card
into the discard 

to the girl who wishes to acquire charm i would also whisper this
secret  make of yourself a mirror in which other people look upon
themselves  especially let men see a flattering reflection of
themselves in your eyes  can your own personal vanity  listen with
bated breath while other people tell you of their exploits  but never
mention your own  enthuse over their cars  their dogs  marvel at their
adventures  sympathize with their disappointments  give the glad hand
to their successes  and you will be universally regarded as a woman of
perfect taste  wonderful insight  profound judgment  a brilliant talker
and a companion of whom one could never weary  it is the tireless
listeners  and not the endless talkers  whom men take out to dinner 

to the girl who wishes to develop charm i would likewise earnestly
recommend an intensive course of self analysis  i would say to her 
 study yourself  find out what you can wear and what you cannot wear 
find out the things that you can do and get away with  and the things
that you cannot do without making yourself appear either a dumbbell or
a figure of fun  then  having ascertained what are your best points 
turn the spotlight on them  emphasize them until you make everybody sit
up and take notice  so that even casual acquaintances will remember
you as the girl who always wears pink  or the girl who always dresses
in black  or the girl with the mona lisa smile  or the girl who is so
jolly and such a cut up  or the girl who listens to you with such an
absorbed expression on her face that you could go on talking to her
forever  i would urge girls to try to be themselves  plus  as they
say in business  and to raise whatever charms of body  or mind  or
heart  they have to its  n th power  that is the best way to acquire
personality  the  something different  about us that sets us apart from
every other human being  instead of our being just one of the herd 

don t be a copycat  don t understudy the mannerisms of another girl
just because she happens to be popular  imitation airs and graces have
about as much sparkle to them as imitation diamonds  besides  you never
can make a go of it  you can t put on another woman s characteristics
any more than you can her clothes  and make them seem as if they were
your own birthday suit  they are always a grotesque misfit  charm has
to be made to order and cut to the measurement of the individual  that
is why one girl may do bold  outrageous things and everybody only
shrugs his shoulders and laughs at her  while another girl is sent to
coventry for not doing half so much  that is why some women always have
a masculine shoulder offered for them to weep upon  while men tell
other women not to be fools whenever they shed a tear 

so the trick is for the girl to find out what her own class is and
qualify for the blue ribbon in that instead of trying to force her
way into a bunch of prize winners where she doesn t belong and where
she will be thrown out by the judges  yet many girls make the mistake
of doing this very thing  a quiet  serious minded  mouse like little
girl observes that some gay and dashing girl  who has quicksilver in
her veins and over whose lips laughter bubbles as spontaneously as a
mountain spring  is much admired and sought after and is the life of
the party wherever she goes 

 aha  vivacity is what makes a girl popular   says the demure one to
herself   i will also be sprightly  and merry  and make a hit  

so she tries to imitate the high spirits of the gay girl  but she can t
do it  her home made vivacity is as flat as home brew beer beside
imported champagne  instead of being bright  she is loud  instead of
laughing  she giggles  instead of being sprightly  she jumps around
like a monkey on a stick  she is so afraid she won t talk enough that
she chatters incessantly  and instead of amusing people she bores them
to death 

yet the very girl who is such a failure as a live wire could have
charmed every one if only she had given a master performance of girlish
sweetness  and gentleness  and quietness  she could have been a great
success if she had remained the shrinking violet that nature made her 
but she was a rank failure as a gaudy sunflower 

then there is the big  amazonian woman who tries to be cute and
cunning  because she sees some baby doll getting the glad hand when
she curls up on sofas  and sits on one foot  and perches on the edges
of tables  and who only succeeds in looking like a performing elephant
instead of a playful kitten when she performs these stunts  and there
is the woman without an inch of funny bone in her whole anatomy who
tries to tell good stories because she sees some jolly woman raconteur
set the table in a roar at dinner parties  and who wonders why people
burst into tears instead of into peals of mirth when she recites her
carefully memorized jokes 

they couldn t fill other women s r les  yet the big woman could have
made us worship her as a goddess if she had stayed on her pedestal
instead of coming down and trying to do double somersaults in the
ring  we would have listened eagerly enough to intelligent talk from
a serious thinker who didn t try to be funny  for heaven knows we get
tired enough of amateur jokesmiths who think we want to be perpetually
tickled in the ribs  believe me  girls  there is much wisdom in the old
proverb that advises the shoemaker to stick to his last  we are most
admirable when we are what nature made us with the aid of a few little
arts and embellishments to throw the original model up into higher
relief  so i counsel you to make the most of yourselves  abandon the
foolish attempt of trying to make yourselves over into a poor copy of
some woman who is admired  charm isn t standardized  it has a million
forms  and every woman should illustrate her own particular version of
it 

after all what we call charm is largely a matter of personality and
the girl who wishes to cultivate that elusive something that we call
personality does well to pay much attention to her dress  this sounds
like superfluous advice to the sex whose brains are mostly cut on the
bias and shirred in the middle  and which is more concerned over the
hang of a skirt than it is over the state of its immortal soul  it is
not too much to say that three fourths of women s thoughts and interest
in life and heart felt desires and envies are concentrated upon
clothes  and the marvel always is that they can put so much effort on a
subject and get such poor results 

for the great majority of women only think of dress in terms of
fashion  and they follow the mode of the moment as sheep follow their
leader over a wall  they wear blue or purple  pink or green  short
skirts or long skirts  tight ones or full ones  without any reference
to their complexions or whether their ankles are sylphlike or like
the legs of a piano  or whether they are living skeletons  or have
featherbed figures  the result is that thousands upon thousands of
women look as if their worst enemy had bought their clothes  and their
hats are a premeditated insult to their faces  but they go their way 
serene and happy  having done the worst they could by themselves  but
blissful in the knowledge that they are wearing what everybody else
is wearing  apparently it never enters the average woman s head that
by clothing herself in the feminine uniform of the hour she makes
herself indistinguishable in the mob  or that she could call attention
to herself by breaking away from it  and dressing to suit her own
particular type  still less does it occur to her that her clothes offer
her an invaluable mode of self expression  and that by them she can
emphasize her good points and camouflage her defects 

yet every moving picture  every play she sees  offers a girl an object
lesson in the psychology of clothes that she does not heed  she never
asks herself why the innocent  trusting maiden  too artless for her own
good  always wears a white muslin and a blue sash  why the ingenue is
always a mass of fluffy ruffles  why the betrayed heroine always wears
a slinky black dress  why the adventuress is clothed in crimson and
spangles  why the vamp invariably wears long jade earrings  and a quart
of beads  and very little else 

yet astute stage managers have found that the surest way to make an
audience visualize a woman in a certain way is to have her dress the
part  a girl might  of course  be as innocent in a crimson dress as
a white one  a woman might be as heartbroken in a pink silk and lace
negligee as she is in a bedraggled black alpaca  but it would take a
long argument to convince us of it  and we wouldn t weep nearly as
freely over her woes as we do when we get an eyeful of her in the
clothes that tell us at once just what a poor  innocent  persecuted
heroine she is 

surely this should suggest to every girl the wisdom of retiring to her
closet  and having a heart to heart session with her wardrobe  and a
vivisection party with her character  and thereby try to find out how
to dress her soul as well as her body  so as best and most effectively
to press agent her individuality  so to speak 

if she is of the bold and dashing type  let her flaunt herself like a
sunflower in daring costumes and flaming colors  but if she is of the
quiet and gentle sort  soft fabrics  chiffons and laces and pastel
shades belong to her  and make her look like the traditional modest
violet that every man dreams of securing as a wife  let the girl who
is flat chested and athletic rejoice in her sport clothes  that is her
note  and brings out a certain piquant boyishness which is her greatest
attraction  but let the girl who is plump  with gracious curves  make
the most of her femininity by decking herself out in the frilliest
frocks that she can find  each will lose in charm if she swaps her
plumage for the other s 

dangling ornaments  floating ribbons and jingling bracelets belong to
the gay and foolish and frivolous  but they detract from the dignity of
the stately  thoughtful  serious minded woman  a tailor made suit is
equal to a certificate of virtue  and when a girl is applying for a job
a plain  dark colored suit will do more to land her the position than a
gilt edged reference  nobody ever believes that a girl in a low necked 
no sleeved frock can ever be a competent business woman  she doesn t
look it  every woman knows that her eyes seem twice as blue if she
has a blue lining to her hat  and that she can turn a spotlight on
her every freckle by wearing a spotted dress  in the same way she can
bring out her characteristics by the way she dresses  if she wishes to
emphasize her cuteness  she can do it by dressing like a baby doll 
if she wishes to be thought a goddess  she can add to her divinity
by long trailing robes  if she wishes to be thought a good sport and
treated as a pal by men  sport clothes are hers  while if domesticity
is her long suit  she can turn the trick by wearing ruffled little
white aprons at home  so study your type  girls  and dress the part 
if you want to make the most of the attractions with which nature has
endowed you

the ordinary woman


i wish that i had the distributing of some of the carnegie medals for
heroes  i would give one to just the ordinary woman  it is true that
she never manned a lifeboat in a stormy sea  or plunged into a river
to save a drowning person  it is true that she never stopped a runaway
horse  or dashed into a burning building  or gave any other spectacular
exhibition of courage 

she has only stood at her post thirty  or forty  or fifty years 
fighting sickness and poverty and loneliness  and disappointment so
quietly  with such a spartan fortitude that the world has never noticed
her achievements  yet  in the presence of the ordinary woman  the
battle scarred veteran  with his breast covered with medals signifying
valor  may well stand uncovered before one braver than he 

there is nothing high and heroic in her appearance  she is just a
commonplace woman  plainly dressed  with a tired face and work worn
hands the kind of woman that you meet a hundred times a day upon the
street without ever giving her a second glance  still less saluting
her as a heroine  nevertheless  as much as the bravest soldier  she
is entitled to the cross of the legion of honor for distinguished
gallantry on the battlefield of life 

years and years ago  when she was fresh and young  and gay  and
light hearted  she was married  her head  as is the case with most
girls  was full of dreams  her husband was to be a prince charming 
always tender and considerate and loving  shielding her from every care
and worry  life itself was to be a fairy tale 

one by one the dreams fell away  the husband was a good man  but he
grew indifferent to her before long  he ceased to notice when she put
on a fresh ribbon  he never paid her the little compliments for which
a woman s soul hungers  he never gave her a kiss or a caress  and
their married life sank into a deadly monotony that had no romance to
brighten it  no joy or love to lighten it 

day after day she sewed and cooked and cleaned and mended to make a
comfortable home for a man who did not even give her the poor pay of a
few words of appreciation  at his worst he was cross and querulous  at
his best he was silent  and would gobble his food like a hungry animal
and subside into his paper  leaving her to spend a dull and monotonous
evening after a dull and monotonous day 

the husband was not one of the fortunate few who have the gift of
making money  he worked hard  but opportunity does not smile on every
man  and the wolf was never very far away from their door 

women know the worst of poverty  it is the wife  who has the spending
of the insufficient family income  who learns all the bitter ways of
scrimping and paring and saving  the husband must present a decent
appearance  for policy s sake  when he goes to business  certain things
are necessities for the children  and so the heaviest of all the
deprivations fall upon the woman who stays at home and strives to make
one dollar do the work of five 

that is the way of the ordinary woman  and what sacrifices she makes 
what tastes she crucifies  what longings for pretty things and dainty
things she smothers  not even her own family guess  they think it is an
eccentricity that makes her choose the neck of the chicken and the hard
end of the loaf and to stay at home from any little outing  ah  if they
only knew 

for each of her children she trod the gethsemane of woman  only to go
through that slavery of motherhood which the woman endures who is too
poor to hire competent nurses  for years and years she never knew what
it was to have a single night s unbroken sleep  the small hours of the
morning found her walking the colic  or nursing the croup  or covering
restless little sleepers  or putting water to thirsty little lips 

there was no rest for her  day or night  there was always a child in
her arms or clinging to her skirts  oftener than not she was sick and
nerve worn and weary almost to death  but she never failed to rally to
the call of  mother   as a good soldier rallies to his battle cry 

nobody called her brave  and yet  when one of the children came down
with malignant diphtheria  she braved death a hundred times  in bending
over the little sufferer  without one thought of danger  and when the
little one was laid away under the sod  she who had loved most was the
first to gather herself together and take up the burden of life for the
others 

the supreme moment of the ordinary woman s life  however  came when she
educated her children above herself and lifted them out of her sphere 
she did this with deliberation  she knew that in sending her bright boy
and talented girl off to college she was opening up to them paths in
which she could not follow  she knew that the time would come when they
would look upon her with pitying tolerance or contempt  or perhaps god
help her  be ashamed of her 

but she did not falter in her self sacrifice  she worked a little
harder  she denied herself a little more  to give them the advantages
that she never had  in this she was only like millions of other
ordinary women who are toiling over cooking stoves  slaving at
sewing machines  pinching and economizing to educate and cultivate
their children digging with their own hands the chasm that will
separate them almost as much as death itself would 

wherefore i say the ordinary woman is the real heroine of life

teach the children to love father


are you teaching your children to love and admire their father  do you
ceaselessly point out to your children their father s good qualities 
do you hold their father up as a hero before your children s eyes  do
you teach your children to appreciate their father  if you do not 
you are not giving your husband a fair deal  nor a run for his money 
fatherhood calls for just as many sacrifices as motherhood does  the
only coin in which these can be repaid is affection and gratitude  and
if he is defrauded of these he is poor indeed 

from the time the first baby is born the average man becomes literally
the slave of his family  he sells himself into bondage so that his
children may live soft  that they may have advantages that he never
had in his youth  that they may enjoy luxuries he never knew  he works
overtime and grows prematurely old and bent  that his boys may go to
college and belong to smart clubs and have automobiles  and that his
daughters may attend fashionable schools  and dress like fashion
plates  and go in the right circles 

it is father who stays at home and works through hot summers and cold
winters  when the family goes to europe  it is father who wears the
shabbiest clothes  it is father who has the worst room and the smallest
closet space in the home  the percentage of money that father spends
on himself and in gratifying his own personal tastes and desires is
negligible  virtually all the money he has earned by a lifetime of hard
toil has been lavished on his family 

whether this pays or not  whether all of this labor and anxiety and
self denial have been worthless or not  depends altogether on his
children s attitude toward him  if they love him  if they are grateful
to him  if they appreciate what he has done for them  it is the best
investment that a man ever made  and it makes him richer than any
millionaire  but if his children are indifferent and callous  if they
take all that he has done for them as no more than their due  and
without even a  thank you   if they see in him nothing but a shabby
little man who hasn t been particularly successful as a moneymaker 
then all his life work goes for nothing  his sacrifices are without
reward  he is bankrupt in heart 

now  the attitude of children toward their father is almost entirely
determined by their mother  and whether they look upon him as a
superior being to be adored and worshiped  or merely as a cash register
that they can punch whenever they want any money  depends altogether
upon what she has taught them  there are women who teach their children
to hate and fear their father by making him an ogre to them  when the
children are bad the little culprits are always threatened with what
their father will do to them  the mother thus makes the father the
hanging judge who inflicts punishment on the small sinners 

in this way the mother fills the child s imagination with a picture of
its father as of some dread creature who is always lying in wait to
chastise him  and who could never have any sympathy or understanding
with him  and with whom he could never have any possible companionship 

 i ll tell your father on you when he comes home   is the curse that
millions of women lay between their children and their husbands  and
that seals the children s hearts forever against the fathers who have
given them their very life blood 

there are other women who teach their children to regard their fathers
simply as money making machines that exist solely for their own use and
benefit  what the children want they must have at any cost to father 
and mother undertakes to nag it out of him  the children see that
mother has no consideration for father and they grow up to have none 

she never tells them that they must not even ask for something they
desire because business is bad and their father is harassed and worried
about money  she never tells them that they must stay at home and let
father have a little trip  because he is sick and nerve worn  she lets
them wring the last penny out of him with no more feeling for him than
if he were some sort of automatic device worked by her for supplying
their desires and needs 

other women teach their children to despise their fathers by always
criticizing them and calling attention to their faults  they are
forever telling the children that their fathers are lacking in
enterprise  that they are poor business men  that they are too easy
and let people take advantage of them  that they are high tempered and
hard to get along with  that they have this and that weakness  until
the child s mind is thoroughly poisoned with the idea that his father
amounts to nothing and his opinions are not to be respected 

very few women ever deliberately set themselves to teach their children
to love and appreciate their fathers  very few women ever try to make
their children see their fathers as heroes who  for their sakes  are
fighting the battle of life as bravely and gallantly as any knight of
old  very few women teach their children to show any gratitude to the
fathers who have sacrificed so much for them  why so many women fail
in this important duty is partly through carelessness and a lack of
thought  but mostly because of an unconscious mother jealousy  they
want to be first with their children and monopolize their love  but it
is a cruel thing to the child  and to the father  it robs them both of
so much joy in each other that they miss

strike a balance with matrimony


i get hundreds upon hundreds of letters from disgruntled wives
bemoaning their fates  they tell me that they are sick and weary of
the monotony of domestic drudgery  that they have few amusements 
that their husbands are indifferent to them and never pay them any
compliments or show them any affection  that their husbands find fault
with them for their every mistake  but never give them one word of
praise for all the good work they do 

and these women have brooded over the hardships of their lot until they
have grown morbid and they see the world as one great gob of gloom 
with themselves as the blackest spot in it 

without doubt  marriage is a cruel and a bitter disappointment to
nine tenths of those who enter into the holy estate  especially is it
disillusioning to women because they build such impossible hopes upon
it  and go into it with such a blind faith that they are going to find
it an earthly paradise 

it is incredible  but it is true  that despite her lifelong knowledge
of the daily life her mother has led and her observation of the
domestic strife in the households of her married friends and neighbors 
every girl honestly believes that her own matrimonial venture will be a
perpetual picnic  and that the man she marries will remain the perfect
lover 

of course  it doesn t happen  and when the woman finds out that her
own marriage brings her more kicks than ha pence  when she realizes
that she must share the common lot  when she has to bend her back to
the hard and dreary labor of making a family comfortable  for which
she gets neither the glad hand nor a pay envelope  and when she has to
put up with a man who seems to have cornered the whole visible supply
of pure cussedness  why  it gets upon her nerves  and she feels like
flunking it 

so she beats upon her breast and cries out that this is not the
marriage of which she dreamed  this sordid existence is not what she
married for 

of course  it isn t  but it is marriage as it is  none of us realize
our ideals  our dreams never come true  and even when we get what we
want  it is so warped and twisted that it is no longer the object of
our desires  and we have paid for it more than it is worth  that is
life 

to these unhappy wives i would offer this bit of homely counsel 

sit down  sisters  and have a real heart to heart session with your own
souls  put out of your mind firmly and for all time the idiotic idea
that there is any lot of perfect peace and happiness  any road you
might have traveled that is not strewn with tacks  worry and anxiety
and sickness and sorrow and disappointment and loneliness are the
portion alike of the highest and the lowest  and you cannot escape the
human lot  it is life 

then take a calm and dispassionate survey of your own situation  you
will find your work tiresome and monotonous  so does every other person
in the world find his or hers  the thing we do for our daily bread is
bound to become a grind  do you think for a moment that the banker
doesn t get sick and weary of grappling with credits and loans  that
the author doesn t have to flog himself to his desk  that the actor
doesn t weary of the lines he has said over thousands of times  that
the film star is not nauseated with grease paint 

every one thrills to his task at first as you did to your new pots and
pans and bridal furniture  but the novelty wears off  and then comes
the long  grim stretch of carrying on  because it is your job to which
you have set your hand and which you mean to make a good job just
because it is yours  that is life 

you complain that your husband takes your good work as a matter of
course  but he howls loud and long over your mistakes  that is what
happens to all workers  if you were a stenographer and spelled one
word wrong  if you were a saleswoman and made one error in your
calculations  your boss would pass over the thousands of words you had
spelled correctly and the hundreds of good sales you had made  to call
you down for your blunder 

if you were a writer or an actor  you would find that the critics would
forget all the good work you had done to call attention to the weakness
of your new book  or bemoan the performance you gave in a new part  as
long as we walk straight no one notices it  but when we fall off the
path we attract attention  it is life 

these unhappy wives ask   what shall i do   and one knows not how
to answer the question  to tell them that  if they are patient and
forbearing  and go on doing their duty as wives  they can change mean
husbands into good ones is to tell them a wicked lie  and mislead them
with false hopes  the leopard changes his spots just about as often as
a man does his disposition  and i have yet to see the tightwad become
generous  the surly  glum man turn into a ray of sunshine in his home 
or the hard  cold  selfish man become the perfect lover to his wife 

nor is divorce the solution of the unhappy wife s problem  marriage
is not an episode of which you can say when you get a divorce   this
unpleasant chapter of my life is ended  i will shut the book  and
forget all about it  and be perfectly happy henceforth   marriage sets
its ineffaceable seal upon a woman  it colors her whole life  and
divorce can no more give her back her lost joy  and faith  and trust 
than it can restore her lost girlhood 

besides  there are nearly always children to consider  children whose
welfare a good mother places above her own  children for whom a home
must be kept together  children who must be educated  who must be
started in life  who need a father s support and control  divorce
is not for the woman with children unless conditions are absolutely
intolerable  and for the woman herself divorce is often a jumping out
of the frying pan into the fire  for when she finds that she is rid
of an unkind husband  she has to face a world that is unkinder still 
generally the woman has no private fortune  the courts award her but
a meager alimony  and the collecting of that is generally about the
hardest job on earth  she is trained to no business or occupation 
nobody wants her services  and she comes to know that the grumbling of
an ill tempered husband is no harder to endure than the howl of the
wolf outside of her door 

perhaps the best advice that one can offer these unhappy wives is to
try to forget what they expected of marriage  and to just put it on
a business basis  so much for so much  with a settled determination
to make the best of a bad bargain  their little flier in heart s
consolidated hasn t paid the dividends they expected it to  well  our
speculations seldom do  their matrimonial partners have proved hard to
get along with  well  many business men endure cranky men partners  who
rasp their nerves  for the sake of the good of the firm 

and on the credit side of the ledger the unhappy wife can set this
down  that she has  at least  her home  and her settled position in
society  and they are great gain  it takes years and years of struggle
and striving for the lone woman to reach the goal where she can have
her own house  and gather about her the household gods that women
worship  and that bless one by their presence 

i am not arguing that a woman would consider a house  no matter if it
were a palace  a satisfactory substitute for a tender  loving husband 
but i am trying to induce the woman who has an indifferent husband to
realize that she is not half as badly off as she thinks she is  as long
as she has her creature comforts 

fortunately  the law of compensation always holds  the man who is a
poor husband is often a good provider  flirtatious husbands often atone
for their sidesteppings with diamonds and furs  stingy ones leave women
rich widows  even grouches leave their wives free to amuse themselves
in their own way  after all  life is a series of compromises  if we
don t get the best  we are very foolish to throw away the second
best and the wise woman who finds marriage a failure doesn t go into
physical and spiritual bankruptcy  she gets the best out of what she
has  she makes the most of her bargain 

all of which just boils down into this  dry your eyes on your best
embroidered towels  o ye disgruntled sisters  and realize that you are
not so unfortunate as you think you are  and what you are called upon
to bear is just life

jealousy


a woman wants to know if there is any cure for jealousy  she says that
she knows her husband loves her devotedly  he is true and faithful to
her  he is as domesticated as the house cat and casts no roving eye
at the pretty flappers  nevertheless  every time he speaks to another
woman she endures grinding torments of suspicion 

there is only one cure for jealousy  that is to use a little common
sense  but this puts the remedy out of the reach of the green eyed 
because jealousy is a form of insanity 

it is a lack of mental balance that makes people imagine things that
do not exist  that causes them to see deep  dark plots in the most
innocent acts and that makes them deliberately torture themselves by
believing that the ones that they love most are traitors to them  also 
it is what the alienists call  the exaggerated ego  that makes any man
or woman believe that he or she can supply another individual s whole
need of human companionship 

for jealousy isn t confined solely to lovers  some of the most acute
attacks are the jealousy that men and women feel for their in laws 
sometimes parents are even jealous of their own children  wives are
often jealous of their husband s business  and always jealous of the
old friends of their bachelor days  but however and wherever it is  and
no matter how causeless and needless it may be  jealousy poisons the
life and ruins the happiness of all of those who indulge in it  it is
the source of endless quarrels between husbands and wives  and it slays
love quicker than any other one thing  indeed  the jealous bring down
the curse they fear upon their own heads 

by their suspicions the jealous materialize the very thing they most
dread  for there is no surer way of driving a man or a woman into
philandering than by keeping dangling continually before his or her
eyes a romantic possibility in which he or she is likely to indulge
at any moment  many a married man would never think of himself as
a lady killer in fact  he would consider that he was married and
settled  and done with sentimental episodes  except that his wife
keeps alive his belief in himself as a heart smasher by her jealousy 
if she considers him so fascinating that she is afraid to let him
have a casual conversation with another woman  or take a turn around
a ballroom floor with a pretty girl  he argues that he must be some
sheik  and so he buys him some klassy kut kollege klothes and sets his
hat on the side of his head and proceeds to justify her once groundless
suspicions 

furthermore  jealousy is its own undoing  because it strikes a death
blow at our personal liberty  which is dearer to us and more necessary
to our happiness than any man or woman ever is  none of us likes to be
called upon to furnish an alibi  none of us enjoys being put through a
questionnaire about everything that was said to us and everything we
said  none of us but resents not being free to go and come as we like
within reasonable bounds and to hold ordinary social intercourse with
any one we choose  so if husbands and wives went about deliberately
to kill every particle of affection that their mates have for them 
they could take no better way to do it than by spying upon them  by
attributing unworthy motives to them  by curtailing their freedom and
by making such jealous scenes that  for the sake of peace  they are
forced to lie and deceive  besides  jealousy is an unforgivable insult 

there are women who have conniption fits every time their husbands make
themselves agreeable to their dinner partners or take a chance met
old woman friend out to lunch  there are wives who never believe that
their husbands can admire a beautiful woman or enjoy the society of
a brilliant one innocently  they attribute the basest motives to the
men they love and accuse them not only of being faithless  but of the
grossest animalism  which was far and away from the thoughts of the
poor gentlemen 

finally  jealousy is an indication of the inferiority complex  the
woman who is jealous of all other women in her heart believes them all
her superiors  she believes them better looking  more intelligent 
more charming  with more attraction for her husband than she has  that
is why she is so afraid of their getting him away from her  you can t
imagine a queen being jealous of a milkmaid or a lillian russell being
jealous of an ugly duckling  or a star dancer not being willing to
have her husband to tread a measure with some lump of a girl who would
walk all over his feet  all of this being true  then  the way to cure
jealousy is to apply common sense to the situation  try to look at it
fairly and squarely  in the first place  your husband or wife wouldn t
have married you if he or she hadn t preferred you to every one else
in the world  if you had charm before marriage you have it still  if
you will take the trouble to use it  in the second place  you know that
you enjoy talking to other people  and that your contact with them is
perfectly harmless  why not believe your husband or wife is as decent
as you are  in the third place  why keep your husband or wife always
fed up with the idea that he or she is a fascinator that no woman or
man can resist  it makes them want to try and see if they can stand
them up  and lastly  if you are married to a man or woman whom you
believe to have so little truth and honor  and who cares so little for
you that he or she can t be trusted out of your sight  why worry about
him or about her  he or she isn t worth a single pang of jealousy 




vii

have a goal


the great trouble with the majority of women is that they have no
plan of life  no real objective  they are the victims of fads  they
wobble about from interest to interest  the thing they were crazy about
yesterday they throw into the discard to day  they waste their time 
and energy  and ability in pursuing will o  the wisps  like the hero of
the popular song  they are on their way  but they don t know where they
are going 

this is why so many women fail  as is abundantly proved by the fact
that when a woman does make up her mind about what she wants to do 
when she has one settled ambition instead of a lot of vague desires 
she is almost invariably successful  let her once determine to tread a
definite path and she not only arrives  but she arrives with bells on 

of course  the reason that women tackle the business of existence in
this hit or miss fashion is not really their fault  poor dears  it is
because of the idiotic way in which we bring up girls on the assumption
that each one has a regiment of fairy godmothers and guardian angels
looking after her and taking care of her  so that she doesn t need
to bother her pretty little head about learning how to take care of
herself  so we don t teach a girl  as we do a boy  that our lives are
just what we make them  that we are the architects of our own fate  and
that whether our lives are ugly  and botchy  and of little worth  or
beautiful  and well rounded  and valuable  depends upon our having some
plan of life in our heads and working to it 

we tell the boy that he who is jack of all trades is good at none  and
that if he wishes to be a carpenter  or a master plumber  or a bank
president  or a surgeon  he must serve his apprenticeship in his chosen
trade or profession and concentrate on the study of it if he means to
succeed  he will never get anywhere as long as he goes from job to job
and dabbles first at one thing and then at another  but we don t teach
girls that it is just as important for them to have some definite plan
of life and prepare themselves to do some particular work as it is for
their brothers  most girls in these days have to earn their own living
until they are married  but most of them do just as little work as they
can get by with  and they do this little aimlessly 

here and there is a stenographer who works by a plan  she has set
herself to become a highly paid private secretary  here and there is a
shop girl who has her eye on a buyer s job and trips to europe  here
and there is a milliner or a dressmaker whose dream is of her own shop 
here and there is a boarding house keeper whose ambition it is to run
a hotel  very seldom do these women fail to attain their desires  they
know what they are trying to do and they make every lick of work count 
they bend every energy to one end instead of wasting it on a hundred
ineffectual endeavors  they put their backs  their hearts  their brains
into their work and that combination invariably spells success 

but the great majority of working women simply potter purposelessly
along  they don t expect to do what they are doing very long  and
so they don t take the trouble to try to learn how to do it well 
they have no interest in their work  no ambition  they haven t even
bothered to pick out the thing to do for which they have a natural
aptitude  they have taken up the occupation they follow just because
they happened to do so  they don t give a single lobe of their brain to
studying it or trying to fit themselves to be competent  they take life
as casually as that  yet they may have to do this same work for thirty
or forty years  for it is by no means certain that every girl will get
a husband or that the husband will be able to support her if she does
get him 

women do not even have any plan about following the great career of
wifehood and motherhood to which they all look forward  probably every
girl who goes to the altar desires to be a good wife and mother  but
she does not crystallize these vague intentions into any concrete
plan of action  not one woman in a thousand sits down in her bridal
bungalow or apartment and works out a scheme for handling her husband
without friction  for running her house economically and for making
her marriage a success  on the contrary  she trusts it all to luck  if
she is a good housekeeper  she feeds her husband well  if she doesn t
like to cook  she gives him dyspepsia by sitting him down to dinners
of underdone meat and overdone bread and watery vegetables  if she
is amiable and good natured  she gets along with him  if she is high
tempered  she rows with him  if she is thrifty  she saves his money and
they prosper  if she is extravagant  she runs him into debt 

it is because wives have no plan about what they do as wives that
matrimony is such a gamble  and it is the same way about motherhood 
there is no other thought in the world so terrible as that mothers
bring up their children without any plan about what they are trying
to make them  they are shaping an immortal soul  and they don t even
know what they are trying to make of it  that is the capital crime of
aimlessness  women will never succeed until they conquer this weakness
and learn how to plan their lives  you cannot do anything effectively
unless you know what you are trying to do

the goat family


kind reader  meet my friends  the goats  they are not rich  for  altho
mr  goat has been an able and energetic business man all his life  and
mrs  goat has been a thrifty housekeeper  they have never been able to
get much ahead because they have always had such a horde of parasites
to support  ever since they had a home they have run a free hotel  they
have literally been eaten out of house and home by self invited guests 
by forty seventh cousins who always cashed in the blood relationship
for board and lodging  and by old friends who suddenly remembered  when
they happened to be in their town  how they loved the goats and hated
to pay for their own beds and meals 

any one of their many acquaintances who wished to take a vacation
without expense  or have an operation performed  or go to the opera 
or see the sights of the city  just wished himself or herself on the
goats  and arrived bag and baggage to camp in the spare bedroom  and
that was all there was to it  a pleasant and economical arrangement so
far as the guests were concerned  and if it was inconvenient to the
goats and they had to sleep around on cots and do without new clothes
to pay for the food that the deadbeats gobbled up  why  nobody bothered
about that  and the goats never complained  they never made a move to
chuck these grafters out  not even rich cousin susan  who could have
bought the family up a hundred times over  when she came and stayed six
months  wore mother goat to a frazzle waiting on her and ran them into
debt because she couldn t eat anything but the most expensive foods 
no  they feel that it would be a stain on their escutcheon to assert
themselves and look out for themselves a little  and so they lived up
to the goat coat of arms  which is a doormat couchant  with everybody
trampling over it 

by and by the eldest miss goat got married  her husband proved to
be a bumptious  egotistical  opinionated fellow  and when he was
about the whole goat family had to walk on eggs and suppress all
their own opinions and tastes to avoid irritating him  indeed  when
their daughter married  the goats acquired a new son  as the phrase
goes  because every sunday and on high days and holidays the young
couple arrived to take dinner with papa and mamma  it was so sweet
to be all together at such times  and it was also so economical and
saved them the work and worry of getting their own dinner  then the
son billy got married  not being born a goat  billy s wife had not
the suffer and be strong complex in her  on the contrary  she was a
go getter  and what she wanted she had to have  therefore  father goat
was often called on for money to help pay mrs  billy s bills  which had
to be met regardless of what sacrifice it entailed on the goats at home 

mrs  billy died  and  of course  billy took his motherless children 
one of them a tiny baby  back home for mother and sister to take care
of  they did it for a few years  until billy married again  altho it
reduced poor  worn out mother to a physical wreck  the family didn t
approve of billy s choice of a second wife  but  with the goat faculty
for swallowing anything  they accepted her and felt that at least
one burden would be removed from them and that billy would take his
children and set up his own home 

it appears  however  that the second wife refuses to be bothered with
stepchildren  and so billy has brought his brood back for mother and
sister to rear and support  it takes all the money he can make to
provide for his wife and her relatives whom she has saddled upon him 

mother goat says that no sacrifice is too great to make for her
darling son  nor does she hesitate to offer up as a burnt offering
her unmarried daughter  nanny goat  who labors in an office all day
to make the money to help maintain the family  and who comes home at
night and does most of the housework 

but nanny is beginning to show un goatlike traits  she doesn t see why
she should work to feed a lot of bum company who sponge on them instead
of paying their own board somewhere  she doesn t see why she should
spend her sundays and holidays  cooking dinners for sister and brother
and the in laws when they might just as well eat at home or go to a
restaurant  and she doesn t see what right brother has to foist the
care of his children and their support on his old parents and his young
sister 

 i am spending my life slaving for other people and bearing other
people s burdens   wails poor little nanny goat   i earn a good salary 
but i can never have any pretty clothes or indulge myself in any of the
amusements i crave  because all my money is spent on people who just
make a convenience of us  and who think more of being invited somewhere
else to tea than they do of living on us without cost for a month  all
my youth  when i ought to have the pleasures of the young  is being
given to trying to raise my brother s children  and do for them the
things that he himself is too weak and pusillanimous to do  and i am
sick and tired of it  i am tired of supporting grafters that are more
able to work than i am  i am sick of being bled white by blood suckers 
i am sore at having to do other people s duty for them  and i want to
know how i can get out of being a perpetual goat as long as i live  

alas  poor little nanny  it is easier for the leopard to change its
spots than it is for one who was born a goat to cease being one  still 
the thing can be done  if you have nerve enough to butt your way to
freedom  shut the door in the face of the deadbeat visitors  make your
brother act the part of a man and assume his own responsibilities  and
you will find that you have gained not only relief but that you have
gone up a hundred per cent in every one s esteem 

for while we all make use of the goat family  we hold them in contempt
because they let us make goats of them

spoiling a wife


a man asks   can a husband be too good to his wife   yes  a husband
can be too good to his wife  so can a wife be too good to her husband 
husbands and wives are just as easily spoiled as babies are  and
they react to spoiling exactly the same way that babies do  they
become peevish  and fretful  and unreasonable  they howl for the
moon  the more they are given in to  the more they demand and the
more unrelenting their tyranny becomes  they smash things in sheer
wantonness  and they need nothing on earth so much as to be turned
across somebody s knee and given a good spanking  and made to behave
themselves 

all of us know plenty of men and women  with many fine and noble
qualities  who would have made splendid husbands and wives if they had
not been badly spoiled by their overindulgent wives and husbands  but
instead of being disciplined  and forced to control themselves  and
made to act like reasonable human beings  they had their weaknesses
indulged  their selfishness encouraged  their exactions given in
to  until they became a curse to themselves and to those who had the
misfortune to be married to them 

of course  when my correspondent speaks of a man being  good  to his
wife  he means it in the sense of being indulgent to her  no man can
be too good to his wife in the way of being kind  and tender  and
sympathetic  and just  and fair to her  but he is not good to her in
fact  he does her a cruel wrong when he is overly indulgent to her  he
ruins her life no less than his own because the spoiled wife is never
happy  she is always discontented  restless  dissatisfied  wanting
something she hasn t got and that is just beyond her reach  she thinks
only of herself  and her pleasures  and the self centered can always
find flaws in their lot  the only contented wives are those who are
doing their part toward making their marriage a success  the grafting
wives are always whiny  and complaining  and disgruntled 

a man  for instance  is too good to his wife when he lets her lie down
on her end of the matrimonial partnership  his part of the contract
is to work and make the money to support a home  her part is to make
a comfortable home  there are many women who refuse to do this  and
who force their husbands to live around in boarding houses and hotels 
there are many more women who are so lazy and shiftless that they keep
their houses as dirty as pigstys  and never give their husbands a meal
that isn t a first aid to the undertaker  there are men who have to get
up and get their own breakfasts before they start to business  while
their good for nothing wives slumber and sleep  there are men who have
to come home after a hard day s work and help get the dinner  and wash
the dishes  and bathe the baby  and sweep the floors  and do all the
housework that their trifling wives have left undone 

nothing but being a bedridden invalid excuses a woman for not doing her
share of the work and for not feeding her family on properly cooked
food  and any man is very silly who puts up with slack housekeeping
from an able bodied wife  she would get busy quickly enough with the
broom and the cookbook if she knew she would lose her job unless she
made her man comfortable 

a man is too good to his wife or too bad to her when he lets her ruin
him with her extravagance  there are men of ability  men who are
industrious  men who are filled with ambition and who were on the high
road to success when they married  but they got spenders and wasters
for wives  and thereafter their lives became just a frantic struggle
to keep even with the bill collector  strive as they would  they could
never get ahead  they had to let every opportunity pass them because
they never had a cent to put into any enterprise  every dollar had
gone to pay for the wife s clothes  and entertaining  and trying to
keep up with people better off than they 

the man who never says  no  to his wife s ceaseless demands on his
pocketbook may think that he is being good to her  but in reality
he could do her no worse turn  for you can no more satisfy a greedy
woman than you can a greedy child  such women are the daughters of the
scriptural horse leech  forever crying   more  more  more   and in the
end  when the crash comes  the extravagant wife is crushed under the
ruin she has brought upon her household 

a man is too good to his wife when he makes all of the sacrifices and
she monopolizes all of the privileges  there are households in which
the husband has no rights or consideration whatever  he goes shabby 
while wife is arrayed like solomon in all his glory  he walks  while
wife rides around in a limousine  he stays at home  while wife goes
forth to summer and winter resorts  his tastes  his comfort  his
pleasure are never considered  he cultivates selfishness in his wife
by never demanding a square deal from her and by never making her give
as well as take  and his reward is his wife s contempt  for no woman
respects a man upon whom she can wipe her feet 

oh  yes  a man can easily be too good to his wife  the really good
husbands are not those who make spoiled babies of their wives  but
those who encourage their wives to develop into self controlled 
helpful  useful women

the absence cure for family ills


one of the most pathetic things on earth is the unnecessary unhappiness
we endure  the big  heartbreaking tragedies no one may escape  the loss
of those we love  frustrated hopes  disappointments  despair  these are
the inevitable portion of humanity  and there is dignity in meeting
them with courage 

but to have your life poisoned by the sting of a gnat  to be done
to death by pin pricks  to be robbed of your happiness by petty
aggravations  that is a different matter  and one rages alike against
the futility of it  and the ignominy of it  and  curiously enough  we
neither endure with fortitude these little  petty ills that spoil the
peace of our days  nor do we try to seek a remedy for them 

take family troubles  for example  which are responsible for more real 
heartbreaking  never ending misery than anything else in the world  a
man and a woman drawn together by some fleeting physical attraction get
married  when that is over  they find that they have not one thing on
earth in common  their tastes differ on everything from politics to
pie  their every idea and opinion is antagonistic  they do not think
the same thoughts  or speak the same language  they may be people of
the highest integrity  models of all the virtues  they may try to do
their duty nobly and with self sacrifice  but their home is a dark and
bloody battleground where they fight over every topic like dogs over a
bone  and they make life a hell on earth for each other 

sometimes parents and children cannot get along together  sometimes
a nice  domestic old hen hatches out a swan  sometimes a swan finds
that nature has bestowed an ugly duckling upon her  and great is the
clacking  and the clucking  and the feather picking around the barnyard 

often brothers and sisters cannot agree  they clash on every subject
under the sun  they express their opinions of each other with the
brutal candor of near relationship  and leave each other sullen and
sore with resentment  they never sit down to a meal without being
verbally armed to the teeth  and the maimed survivors feel as if they
had been through the battle of the marne  sometimes there is just one
particular member of a family who is a perpetual storm center  and who
has but to blow in at the door to shatter the peace and harmony of the
household 

being obliged to live with disagreeable and antagonistic people is the
greatest affliction that can possibly befall us  nothing compensates
for it  not tho we dwell in a palace  with every meal a banquet  and
have everything that money can buy us  better it is to dwell on a
housetop  or in a lodging house  and eat at a quick lunch place  and
have peace  than abide in splendor with those who irritate the very
soul out of us 

nor are we consoled by the fact that the very people who are so
impossible to live with love us well enough to die for us 

we know well enough that it is mother s affection for us  and her
anxiety about us  that makes her nag us incessantly  and hand out
advice to us until we are ready to scream  in their philosophical
moments men and women realize that even their in laws knock them for
their own good 

but it is the result  and not the theory  with which we are concerned 
and as you listen to the wail of those who cry out against uncongenial
marriages  and the moans of anguish of the in laws who dwell under
the same roof  and listen to the sounds of fratricidal strife  when
everybody could be so happy if they didn t have to live with each
other  you wonder that so few people have the wisdom and the courage to
apply the one sure cure for their misery  that is to separate  apart
they would be happy  they would even love each other  they would get a
perspective on each other s good qualities  but living together they
merely get on each other s nerves  and hate each other 

the old idea that blood is thicker than water  and that just
because you happen to be born in a certain relationship to a group
of individuals makes you automatically love them  and desire their
society  hasn t a word of truth in it  it is not even true in the
relationship between parents and children 

as long as their children are young and helpless  most mothers have
an animal fondness for them  but when they are older  it very often
happens that a mother cannot get along in peace with her children  she
does not understand them  she has nothing in common with them  and she
is glad enough when they are grown and leave home 

no theory has been more mischievous than the old convention that people
who were of the same family had to keep on living together  no matter
how much they rubbed each other the wrong way  nor how unpleasant this
enforced companionship was  there is no sense in doing it  no rhyme
nor reason for it  because aunt jane is aunt jane is no reason why you
should take her into your home and be bored the balance of your life
by her reminiscences  nor is there any reason why you should have your
temper continually rasped by antagonistic sisters and brothers when
there are plenty of agreeable strangers in the world 

try the absence cure on your domestic troubles  get up and leave an
unpleasant home  you have no idea how much better you will love a lot
of your relatives when you put about a thousand miles between you and
them

the deadly rival


it would be interesting to know how many estranged husbands and wives
began drifting apart with the advent of the first baby  children
are popularly supposed to be the tie that binds a man and woman
indissolubly together in body and spirit in marriage  often this is
true  and in their love and hopes and ambitions for their children
a husband and wife literally do become  two souls with but a single
thought  two hearts that beat as one   also very often for the sake of
their children men and women endure a marriage that they have come to
loathe and hate  and are bound together like prisoners whose balls and
chains clank at every movement they make 

unhappily  children s hands do not always draw husbands and wives
closer together  they just as often push them apart  and when this
happens it is oftener the woman s fault than the man s  few men prefer
their children above their wives  but for the great majority of women
their husbands exist only as their children s father and as purveyors
to their children 

the first baby definitely and for all time puts the husband s nose out
of joint  up to that time  husband has been king of the domestic realm 
his wife has put on her prettiest clothes and adorned herself for him 
she has been chum and playmate  she has exerted herself to amuse and
entertain him  she has looked out for his comfort  has seen that he
had the best of everything  and he has reveled in the bliss of having
the center of the stage and the spotlight turned always upon him  then
arrives the baby  and from having been the worshiped head of the house 
husband finds that he is nothing  with no one so poor as to do him
reverence 

wife no longer cares what sort of a figure she cuts in his eyes  or
whether he admires her or not  she looks sloppy around the house
because the baby pulls at her clothes and musses her chiffons  when
husband wants to go out at night she refuses because she can t leave
the baby  and if he drags her along anyway  she interrupts the most
thrilling part of a play to ask him if he thinks the nurse has
forgotten to give the baby his bottle 

there are no more chatty evenings at home  because she is off
worshiping before the baby s shrine  she quits reading anything but
baby books  and her conversation gets to be about as stimulating as
sterilized milk  she is too busy with the baby to show her husband any
of the little attentions that men so love  or to see even that he has
the things he likes to eat 

there are thousands of homes which are run exclusively for the
children  there is never any food on the table except just the simple
things that children can eat  there is never any conversation except
about the children  the wife never manifests the slightest interest in
her husband  or shows him any affection  all of the tenderness  the
caresses  the sympathy and understanding is lavished on the children 
it is the children s likes and dislikes and prejudices that are
remembered and catered to 

there are many wives who begrudge every cent that a husband spends on
himself because they want the money to throw away on the children  they
will nag their husbands into giving up smoking so that they can buy the
baby a real lace cap  there are wives who literally work their husbands
to death that their daughters may go off to finishing schools  and
their boys have the latest model sports automobile 

now the average man loves his children  but he has not this crazy 
obsessing passion for them that their mother has  when the first
baby comes he is proud of it and fond of it  and he wants it to have
every proper care and attention  but he doesn t want to spend hours
sitting by its crib  gloating over it and marveling at how naturally it
breathes  he wants to go about the ordinary affairs of life as he did
before the baby was born  and he wants his wife s companionship 

but she will seldom go with him  and when she does  she is no fun
because she doesn t enter into the spirit of anything  she has left
her whole interest in life behind in the nursery  nor is she an
entertaining companion at home any more  and it gets on his nerves
being told to  sh h h h sh  every time he shuts the door  for fear he
will wake the baby 

he even discovers that his wife is relieved when he goes out without
her  and leaves her undisturbed to her infant adoration  and so the
rift is first made between them  each starts on a life in which the
other has no part  and that takes them farther away from each other as
the years go by 

if the true co respondent were ever named in many a divorce case  it
would be the first baby  there are always plenty of women a man can
find who will play with him while his wife is busy in the nursery  who
will listen to him and flatter him  while his wife is telling the baby
he is the most boofulest thing in the world  while mama is holding
the baby s hand  some vamp is generally holding papa s  it is a great
thing to be a good mother  but it is equally as great a thing to be a
good wife  and it is a bad thing to do either one at the expense of the
other  often children are better off for a little wholesome neglect 
but a husband never is 

remember that  ladies  and don t make your baby your husband s deadly
rival

learn a trade  girls


these few lines are addressed to the thousands of girls who have
finished school and who are now standing  as the poet puts it   where
the brook and river meet  wondering  where do we go from here  

i want to urge you  girls  with all the earnestness of which i am
capable  to psychoanalyze yourselves and try to find out what talents
and aptitudes nature bestowed upon you  and then to go to some school
where you can develop your gift and fit yourself to be self supporting 

i give this advice to the rich girl no less than to the poor girl  for
in these days of shifting fortunes we have the new poor as well as the
new rich  and no woman knows how soon she may be called upon to earn
her own bread and butter or starve  if she has been taught how to do
this  losing her money is merely an inconvenience to her  but if she
does not know how to earn a dollar  it is a tragedy 

no women in the world are so pitiful as those who have  as the saying
goes   seen better days  and  with their money gone  are suddenly
flung out into the world to make their own living  with no trade  no
profession  no skill in any line  no knowledge of how to make a penny 
they can only eke out an existence by doing the most ill paid work  or
else they become parasites  or are forced by hunger  and shabbiness 
and need into the sad sisterhood of the streets 

don t risk such a fate befalling you  prepare yourself in time against
it  have that within yourself which will not be affected by the fall
in stocks or the depreciation of real estate  many things may rob you
of your fortune  but you cannot lose your trained brain and skilful
hand  they will be a resource that you can always fall back upon in any
emergency 

of course i know  when i urge you girls to fit yourselves to learn some
gainful occupation by which you can support yourselves  that you smile
and say to yourselves that you do not expect to earn your own living
long  you are going to marry and follow woman s oldest profession  that
of wife and mother  that is as may be  in the past the great majority
of women have been able to count  with a fair degree of safety  on
being able to marry  but it is by no means a foregone conclusion that
the girl of to day will get a husband 

there has been a most decided decline and falloff in matrimony and home
life  and it is foolish for girls to think that they have the same
chance of marrying that their mothers and grandmothers had  now  for
the girl who is sitting around and waiting for some man to come along
and marry her  it is a catastrophe to be passed by  she becomes the
sour and disgruntled old maid  eating the bitter bread of dependence 
the fringe on some family that doesn t want her  or else she has to
take any sort of a poor stick of a man as a prop to lean upon 

far different is it with the girl who has fitted herself for some
definite work and is competently doing it  she has a profession in
which she is vitally interested  she has an occupation which fills her
time  she makes enough money to indulge herself in the luxuries that
women love  and so marriage becomes to her merely an incident of life 
not the whole thing  if the right man comes along  well and good  if
not  also well and good  she has her pleasant  independent  interesting
life as a girl bachelor  the world to her is full of such a number of
things besides wedding rings 

furthermore  girls  even if you do marry  you may still need to keep on
being a bread winner instead of becoming a breadmaker  the high cost
of living has to be reckoned with  and not every man under present
economic conditions is able to support a family alone and unaided  in
the past the good wife helped her husband by doing the housework  and
turning  and mending  and pinching the pennies  in the future the good
wife will doubtless help her husband by keeping on with her well paid
job and assisting in making the money to give her family the living
conditions  and her children the education that the man alone could not
afford to give them  so  except among the rich  marriage is going to
mean a retirement from business no more for women than it is for men 

another reason why i urge you  girls  to learn some gainful occupation
and perfect yourself in it is because it will do more than any other
one thing to make you happy  it will keep you from being bored  and
boredom is at the root of all fretful discontent  people who are busy 
who have a definite object in view and are striving to attain it 
find the day all too short  are always content and cheerful  and talk
about thrills  you never really know one until you hold your first
pay envelope in your hand and it surges over you that the money in it
represents your own work that was good enough for somebody to pay for 

being able to make your own living sets you free  economic independence
is the only independence in the world  as long as you must look to
another for your food and clothes you are a slave to that person  you
must obey him  you must defer to him  you must bend your will to his 

but when you can stand on your own feet you can snap your fingers in
the face of the world and tell it where it gets off  you do not have
to endure tyrannical parents  you do not have to put up with a cruel
husband  you can support yourself  and you are free 

so i urge you  girls  never to rest until you have fitted yourselves
to earn your own bread  and butter  and cake  and remember  the better
your work the more you earn  it is efficiency that pulls down the big
pay envelope 

it doesn t make a bit of difference what you do  my dear  it is the
way you do it that counts  you can make a success or a failure of
any occupation under the sun  the fat pay envelope is the reward of
superexcellent work  it isn t the perquisite of any particular trade or
profession 

we do best those things that we enjoy doing  and so i urge you to
sit down quietly and study yourself and try to find out what nature
intended you to be 

probably you have no very decided talent  no cosmic urge that makes you
feel that you must paint  or sing  or dance  or cook  or keep books  or
else life will be dust and ashes in your mouth 

but you are sure to find that there is something that you like to do
better than other things  it may be trimming hats  it may be messing
around the kitchen  it may be that you are quick at figures and can
always remember dates  it may be that you write a good hand  or always
got a hundred in spelling at school 

there is always some one thing for which you have a turn  as the phrase
goes  and that points the road for you to follow 

if you have no mechanical skill  don t do anything that requires
deftness of the hands  if you can t spell  don t waste any time trying
to be a stenographer  if you cannot add up a column of figures three
times without getting four different results  pass up bookkeeping  you
will never make a success of anything for which you have no aptitude 
you will always hate it and be bored by it 

the successful people are those who love their work so well that it
is a sheer joy to do it  who never count the labor that they put into
it  and who are so interested in it that it is perpetually in their
thoughts 

therefore choose the thing that you like to do and get fun out of
doing  and don t just blunder into taking the first job that presents
itself or make the mistake of taking up some profession to which you
are not called because some other girls are doing so or because it
seems to you romantic or elegant 

of course  in these days of the emancipation of women  every road is
as free for a girl to follow as it is to a boy  but you will find that
those women make the greatest successes who stick to purely feminine
lines  there is just as much need for woman s work in the world as
there is for man s  and when it is equally well done it is equally well
paid  in some occupations it is a little better paid because there are
fewer women experts than there are men 

there are very few women who have risen from the ranks to become
presidents of banks  or trust magnates  or big manufacturers  but every
community has in it women who have made tidy fortunes as dressmakers 
or milliners  or boarding house keepers 

teaching  nursing  cooking  sewing  home making in all its
ramifications and branches  buying and selling pretty things  the
building and furnishing of houses  the healing of the sick  all of
these are strictly within the feminine province  and you will not make
a mistake if you choose whichever one of these occupations appeals to
your fancy  women have been unconsciously trained along these lines for
centuries and have for them an inherited aptitude  it takes the average
man years of profound study to acquire the sense of color that a girl
baby is born with  and any dub of a woman can give an architect points
on lights  and kitchen sinks  and the heights of shelves and about
closets  so stick to your last and capitalize your feminine intuitions
instead of trying to invade masculine fields  even women writers and
women artists are more successful when their work is most womanly 
and great actresses will be remembered for the feminine r les they
portrayed  not for the masculine parts they essayed and in which they
were grotesque failures 

having selected your occupation  perfect yourself in it  master its
technique  don t be satisfied to be an also ran  make of yourself a
blue ribbon winner  you will have to work longer hours and harder doing
ill paid work than you will doing highly paid work  the difference
between a     cook and a         chef is just a matter of skill  one
woman gets    for a hat  another      it is just the touch to a bow or
ribbon or a twist to a bit of velvet that does it  whether you get a
thin pay envelope or a thick one as a stenographer  or bookkeeper  or
clerk  depends upon how expert you are  so make up your mind that you
are not going to work for a pittance  and go after the big salary by
making yourself worth it  employers are just pining to pay the price of
good work 

then tackle your job as if you meant to make a life work of it 
don t look upon it as a bridge of sighs that you have to travel over
with reluctant feet from the schoolroom to the altar  think of it as
something you are going to do as long as you live  something that is
going to be your friend  and comforter  and stay  and to which you will
give the best that is in you  that won t keep you from marrying if the
right man comes along  and it will be a powerful stay if no man comes 
not many girls do this  they regard their work as only a makeshift
until they can marry  and so they never take the trouble to learn how
to do it properly  that is why they fail  and why they are ill paid 
don t be one of them  choose a congenial occupation and put your heart
and your back into it  and your success will be assured

trial divorce


i believe the one thing that would do more than anything else to stop
the utter wrecking of homes and the half orphaning of children  in the
case of unhappy marriages  would be the institution of trial divorce
and the refusal of the courts to make any divorce decree absolute under
two years  for so many husbands and wives think they have ceased to
love each other  when they are only too much fed up with each other s
society  so many persons think they long for freedom  when they only
need a rest  so many persons think divorce a panacea for every ill  who
find out  when they try it  that the remedy is worse than the disease 

the great majority of men and women are romantically in love when they
get married  and they expect to live ever afterward in a state of
storybook bliss  then comes the inevitable disillusionment  when they
find out that they have married ordinary human beings instead of angels
and motion picture heroes  comes the clash of personalities  the fight
of the selfish to get the best for one s self  the rebellion at the
sacrifices that matrimony demands 

the woman begins to nag  the man gets grouchy and surly  each magnifies
every fault of the other  resentment and disappointment blot out every
memory of love and tenderness  of goodness and nobility  they come to
the point where they feel that they cannot stand each other a minute
longer and rush off to the divorce courts 

but the ink is hardly dry on their decrees before they begin to view
each other in a kindlier light  the man  living in his club or at
a boarding house  wandering from restaurant to restaurant  hating
the cooking and getting his digestion upset  begins to think of his
ex wife s good points  how true and loyal and devoted she was  what a
good cook and housekeeper  and he wonders that he didn t have enough
sense of humor to laugh at her nagging instead of letting it get on his
nerves 

the woman  trying to make a home for herself with less money than she
is accustomed to  bewildered and terrified at having to face life for
herself  with no man to depend on  begins to recall her husband s
virtues instead of his faults  and to reflect that it is better to have
even a husband who is short on compliments  and shy on attentions  and
long on knocks  than to have no husband at all 

and in their secret souls both are conscience stricken when they look
at their children and see them lacking a mother s or a father s care
and a real home  so there are thousands of couples who are merely
disgruntled with each other who would come together again if a trial
divorce gave them time in which the galled spots that the matrimonial
yoke has made on their necks could heal and they could find out that
they hadn t got such bad teammates  after all 

the trial divorce would do much to solve even those cases in which
husbands and wives think that they have fallen out of love with their
lawful mates and have found their affinities in others  nine times out
of ten the reason that men and women lose their affection for their
husbands and wives is just because they are bored with them  they have
had an overdose of them  they have seen them too long and at too close
range 

every woman knows that when she starts off on her summer vacation she
sees her husband as just a hump shouldered  fat  bald headed man  who
is slouchy about dressing  but after she has been away a week she
begins to remember what a classical nose he has  in a fortnight she
thinks how handsome and distinguished looking he is  and by the end of
the month he is a perfect valentino to her  the man has just the same
reactions about his wife  she goes away fat and frumpy and middle aged 
and she returns merely plump and more attractive than any flapper to
him 

many men and women who think they are permanently tired of their
husbands and wives are only temporarily weary of looking at the
same face and listening to the same line of conversation across the
breakfast table  and if a trial divorce gave them a second choice they
would find that they preferred the old love to the new 

for the lure of the  other woman  and the  other man  is chiefly that
they are unattainable and unknown  and these charms vanish before the
trial divorce that makes them possible and familiar  it gives the
foolish  infatuated husband and wife a chance really to compare the
long haired poet or the short haired flapper with the partners they had
and are about to lose 

give a man time to forget his wife s nagging  and his peaches and cream
complexioned secretary will not look as good a risk  after all  to him
as his faithful old wife  give a woman time to forget the mean things
her husband said to her when they quarreled  and she will think a long
time before she exchanges her good provider for some impecunious glib
love maker 

the truth is  that few men and women find in divorce the solution of
their woes that they expected  they picture it as a state of bliss in
which they will be free of all woes and cares  an earthly paradise in
which there will be no fretting wives or fault finding husbands  and in
which they will be able to do exactly as they please  but they find
its golden apples dead sea fruit that turns to ashes on their lips  the
man who has resented his wife s tyranny and writhed under her curtain
lectures  strangely finds out that he wants to go home  when he has no
home to which to go  and nobody to care whether he ever comes back or
not 

the woman who has thought she would be happy if she no longer had to
live with a neglectful husband  finds that the world also neglects her
and that her freedom has merely brought her the freedom of earning her
own living  and when this hard and bitter knowledge soaks into the
consciousness of men and women many of them would be glad enough to go
back again to their old husbands and wives if they could 

so  when we unscramble our scrambled marriage laws  let s put the trial
divorce into them

a mutual benefit association in which both parties give and receive 
in which they love and are loved in equal measure  cupid  however  is
no dispenser of justice  he rarely holds the scales even  very few
husbands and wives feel the same amount of affection for each other  in
almost every married couple one kisses and the other submits to being
kissed  as the french proverb cynically puts it 

this being the case  it is better for the woman to be the kisser than
the kissee  because  while it is misfortune to a woman never to be
loved  it is a tragedy to her never to love 

of course  every woman desires to be worshiped by some man  and she
dreams of having a husband who will be a perpetual lover and spend his
life laying tributes at her feet  she feels that she would be perfectly
happy doing the goddess on a pedestal act  and occasionally deigning
to bestow a kind word on her adorer  as one throws a bone to a dog 
obsessed by this romantic vision  which flatters her vanity  many a
woman is beguiled into marrying a man for whom she has only a mild
liking because he is so crazy about her  she thinks that he can supply
enough love for two  and that she will be happy and satisfied with just
being loved 

it does not take her long to find out that she has made a sad mistake 
and that there is nothing with which we can get so easily satiated as
we can with the affection we do not return  we have no appetite for it
and it is tasteless in our mouths  nor are there any greater bores than
those who love us  who cling to us  who want to be always with us  but
whom we do not love and of whom we get tired to death 

all of us know doormat husbands whose wives ruthlessly trample them
under foot  we all know peevish  disgruntled  discontented wives  whose
husbands slave to give them luxuries for which they never get so much
as  thank you   we have all held up our hands in horror when some wife
left a good  devoted husband and eloped with another man or packed her
trunk and hiked out for hollywood  and we wondered what was the matter
with these women that they were not satisfied with their husband s love 

the trouble with them was that they had married men who loved them
instead of men they loved  if they had been doing the love making and
trying to hold the affections of husbands whom they suspected every
flapper of trying to steal from them  they would have been too busy 
too thrilled and interested to get into mischief 

there are many reasons why a woman who is contemplating matrimony
should lay greater stress upon the state of her own affections than
she does upon the man s  the principal one  of course  is because a
woman is ten times as much married to her husband as he is to her  and
therefore it is ten times more important that she should be pleased
with her bargain than it is that he should be satisfied with his 

a married man has a million interests  and distractions  and
amusements  and compensations outside of his home  and if his wife does
not turn out to be all that his fondest fancy painted her  he has his
business to fall back upon  his ambition and his career to console him 
he is never wholly dependent on his wife for his happiness  but a woman
stakes her all on her matrimonial gamble  and if she does not love her
husband  if she does not find happiness in her home  she has nothing 

a woman s emotions make her life  what she feels is of more interest
to her than what she does  she cannot substitute liking for loving any
more than she can water for wine  and no matter how much she admires
the man to whom she is married  no matter how grateful she is to him
for his kindness to her  unless he can raise a thrill in her breast
everything is cinders  ashes and dust to her 

she feels that she has missed the best thing in life  the thing she
most wanted  and she is restless and dissatisfied  and is forever on a
still hunt to find her real soul mate 

to the average woman  marriage is a state of perpetual sacrifice  she
must go through the agony of bearing children  and the long  weary
years of ceaseless care and anxiety in rearing them  she must work
harder than any hireling at the dull and monotonous task of cooking and
cleaning and scrubbing and sewing and mending that it takes to make a
comfortable home  and the only thing on earth that can make all of this
worth while is love for her husband  that sets a star in her sky  that
gilds the humblest task  the woman who stands over a stove cooking a
dinner for the husband to whom she is utterly indifferent is a slave
driven to her appointed task by her sense of duty  the woman who stands
over a stove cooking dinner for a husband she adores is a priestess
making a burnt offering of herself on the altar of her god 

the woman who marries the man she loves is never bored  and boredom is
the particular curse of the feminine sex  she throws herself heart and
soul into her husband s interests  and is more eager for his success
than he is himself  she is never dull  because the smallest thing that
concerns him is of more import to her than the events that shake the
great outer world  she can find food for thought and scope for her
activities in the fact that her husband likes onions with his beefsteak
or prefers mushrooms  her days are filled with pleasurable excitement
in preparing for his homecoming of an evening  and when she hears his
key in the latch her heart strikes up  hail to the king  

the woman who marries the man she loves is never dissatisfied  never
disgruntled  he may be a poor thing  but he is her own  the one she cut
out of the bunch and which she marked with her own brand  having got
the one thing she wanted most  she can well afford to pity her poor
sisters who have only limousines and pearls and the merely tolerated
husbands who are the purveyors thereof  a woman should always marry
a man with whom she is very much in love  because it insures her a
stimulating and interesting life  the reason that most women run down
and get slack and slouchy is because they are bored to tears with
domesticity  they do not care for their husbands and so they take no
trouble to please them 

but the woman who is in love with her husband  who married the man she
wanted  is on her tiptoes all of the time  she means to keep him and
she takes no chances on disillusioning him with curl papers  and cold
cream  and bad cooking  and tantrums  she is eternally in pursuit  and
while there may be times when she gets tired and feels as if she would
like to sit down and take things easy  still there is no denying that
the love chase puts pep in any lady s day 

a woman should never marry any man except the one with whom she is very
much in love  because every woman craves romance  and if she doesn t
get it at home she is very apt to seek it abroad  or else she goes
through life hungry  unsatisfied  the wives who get into scandals  who
think they find soul mates in their preachers  or their doctors  or
long haired poets  the wives who run off after strange cults and who
burden down the mails with letters to movie actors are all women who
married men they didn t love 

the women who are crazily in love with their husbands make their own
angel s food at home and don t have to go around trying to pick up
stray crumbs on the street  of course  the woman who loves her husband
better than he does her has her moments of acute jealousy  but even
these are full of ginger and are better than the dull stagnation of
having a man that you don t take the trouble to lock up at night
because you know you can t lose him 

truly  it is more blessed to give than to receive  and it is better for
a woman to love than to be loved

are you good company for yourself 


do you ever think what poor company most of us are for ourselves  it
is strange but true that the one individual on god s earth who bores
the average man and woman more than any one else is just himself
and herself  there is no society they so dread as their own  and no
expedient so desperate that they will not resort to it rather than be
left alone with themselves  they will fasten themselves like leeches
on kinspeople and friends who try to shake them loose  they will stay
on in homes where they know they are not welcome  they will put up
with any discomfort in order to herd together  they will hold up the
telephone poles at the corners of streets  and walk the aisles of the
department stores until they are ready to drop with fatigue 

they will belong to clubs where they foregather with the dull and
prosy and fat witted  and where they spend hours listening to egotists
monologue about how great and wonderful they are  evening after evening
they go to vaudeville performances whose every turn is so stupid it
is enough to make even a hero scream with pain  and to see moving
pictures whose scenarios are an insult to the intelligence of an idiot 

anything anywhere  to get away from themselves  to escape having to
spend an hour in their own company  so universal is the belief that it
is the limit of social and mental poverty to be reduced to your own
society for company  that we speak of those who live alone as being
lonesome  and pity them accordingly 

it does not even occur to us that they may have that within themselves
which could make them gay and witty companions to themselves  of whom
they would never tire 

it is easy  of course  to see why many people are bored to tears with
their own company  men and women who never read anything can t have
very much that is new and interesting to say to themselves  after they
have discussed the state of the green grocery trade with themselves 
on which they are rather fed up anyway after having wrestled with
it all day  or mulled over the last gossip about the neighbors next
door  and wondered for the millionth time how the joneses can afford a
new car  and where the smith girl has been spending the evening when
she came home at   a  m   they find that they have exhausted their
conversational repertoire 

but if they are reading people they can never have a dull instant
when they are alone  for every book  every magazine  every newspaper
is a magic carpet that takes them in an instant into the uttermost
parts of the world  there isn t a strange sight they may not see  or a
secret whispered behind a closed door they may not hear  nor a romance
unfolded whose thrill does not touch their hearts and stir their pulse 
education and cultivation would be worth while if they did nothing else
except take the curse off loneliness 

you can see how people who are envious and jealous and quarrelsome and
mean spirited dread to be left alone with themselves  they have devils
from hell for company  those men and women whose souls are filled with
bitterness and hate  and who are forever thrashing over old grievances 
recalling old wrongs  bringing to life again old enmities 

we all avoid the pessimistic and the cynical those who can see nothing
cheerful or good in the world  and with whom even a chance meeting
seems to take the warmth out of the sunshine  and god out of his
heaven  and make all life dark and foul  how terrible  then  must it
be to live with yourself when you have nothing to say to yourself that
does not leave a dark brown taste in your mouth  it is not strange
that those who have lived hard and selfish and grasping lives are poor
company for themselves 

you cannot imagine a widow spending a cheery evening recalling how she
nagged her poor  dead husband  how cross and peevish and complaining
she was  or how little she had done to repay him for all that he had
done for her  neither can you imagine a woman enjoying telling herself
that if she had been less extravagant  and content with simple things 
if she hadn t demanded fine clothes and jewels and trips to europe 
that her husband would not have had to kill himself working  and that
she might now have some one to talk to  living and breathing  instead
of a demon of remorse 

it is not strange that a man wants other company than the recollection
of how his coldness and neglect turned the bright  joyous  loving 
tender girl he married into a quiet  sad woman who cringed like a
whipped dog before his cruel fault finding  nor is it strange that
the man who has driven hard bargains and overreached in trade  who
has ground down the faces of those who worked for him  who has taken
advantage of the ignorant and the trustful  and built his fortune
on the ruins of widows and children  does not find his own society
exhilarating 

when we are old we have nothing but our memories left us  they are
enough company if they are filled with the smiling faces of those we
loved  who recall to us kindly acts we have done  helping hands we have
held out  and if they murmur to us of kindly  gracious deeds  but they
are terrible companions if they are filled with memories of cruelty
and wrong  considering that  do what we may  we can never escape from
ourselves  that we are bound to endure our own society  is it not a
pity that we do not emulate the poet who said   my mind to me a kingdom
is   and make ourselves better company for ourselves

keeping young


none of us wants to die  no matter how strong our religious faith  nor
how lustily we sing  heaven is my home   none of us is in a hurry to
go there  we prefer to stay in a world in which we are acquainted and
acclimated  likewise  we all dread old age  it fills us with horror to
think of becoming bent and tottering old men and women  our vigor of
mind and body gone  sans hair  sans teeth  sans everything  so from
time immemorial humanity has been on the still hunt for some magic that
will stay the devastating hand of time and enable it to hold on to the
youth it prizes so dearly  the ancients sailed the world over seeking
fabled islands and miraculous fountains of perpetual youth  we moderns
pin our faith to the surgeon s knife and the druggist s bottles  to
monkey glands  and face liftings  and paints  and powders  and hair
dyes 

all in vain  the black oxen of the years march over us  treading out
our youth and beauty  our strength and high spirits  and nothing that
we can do will stop them  so it seems a pity that we should waste so
much thought  so much struggle  and effort  and energy  and money in
essaying an impossible task  for do what we may  we cannot keep young 
and when we try to camouflage age as juvenility the only people in the
world that we fool are ourselves 

we can dye our hair the gold  or the black  or the jet of girlhood  but
we cannot put under it the fresh face of sixteen  we can have our skin
gored and tucked until all of our wrinkles are taken out  but there
still remain the tired  old eyes that have seen fifty or sixty years 
we can starve ourselves until we get the figures of flappers  but we
are not lithe and graceful  we are living skeletons  we can roll our
stockings and borrow our granddaughter s clothes  but it doesn t make
us look like debutantes  it makes us look like those afflicted with
senile dementia  the truth is  the more we fight age the harder it
fights back and the sooner it conquers us  none grow old so quickly as
those who work themselves into premature age trying to keep young 

once i was standing behind a jaunty little figure perched on the
runningboard of a car  she wore the gayest and sportiest of sport
suits  she had the thin figure of a girl of fifteen  her bobbed
henna colored hair curled under the brim of a rakish little hat 
presently she turned around and disclosed a face that was like a mask 
it was so plastered over with cosmetics   heavens  did you ever see
such an old hag   exclaimed a man near me 

now  this woman was not more than fifty years old  she was in the prime
of life  at an age when many women are handsomer than they ever were
in their lives  no one would have thought of her as being old at all 
if she had been willing to appear her own honest age  if she had had
the pleasing plumpness that belonged to her time of life  if her soft 
gray hair had waved about her face  and if she had been appropriately
dressed  it was her effort to appear kiddish that called attention to
what an old goat she was 

if bobbing and dyeing their hair  and dieting themselves to emaciation 
and wearing knee length skirts made elderly women look young and
girlish  they would not only be justified in doing so  it would be a
virtue to do it  for thereby they would make themselves easy on the
eyes  but just the reverse is true  their affectation of youth only
calls attention to what a long distance they have traveled from youth 
old mutton never seems so old  and tough  and stringy as when it is
dressed as spring lamb 

and the folly of trying to act young after you are old is just as great
as that of trying to look sixteen when you are sixty  women have been
told so often they must keep their spirits young  they must never think
old thoughts  they must never speak of age  or admit to themselves they
are getting older  that they have come to believe that  simply by
forgetting their birthdays  they can maintain perpetual girlhood 

we all know women who begin every reminiscence by saying that they were
very young at the time it happened  and who give us to understand their
husbands were cradle snatchers  who married them when they were mere
infants  we know old women who are always teasing themselves about men 
and talking about their best beaus  and pretending to have flirtations
with boys young enough to be their grandsons  and repeating compliments
about their eyes or their fascinations they allege men paid them 
but that even an idiot would know that they made up themselves  how
ridiculous the poor souls make themselves  how infinitely older they
appear than the women who do not try to pose as vamps after they have
ceased to look the part  and who regard men just as they do women  as
interesting and agreeable human beings 

perhaps  after all  we make too big a bugaboo of growing old  the
twilight has its charms no less than the dawn or high noon  and so the
last lap of the journey of life has its compensations and its joys if
we are willing to accept them 

anyway  the only way we can escape old age is by dying young  but if we
welcome it as a friend  it deals kindlier with us than if we fight it
as an enemy

gossip  the policeman


a young woman writes me that she considers that she has a right to live
her own life in her own way and do exactly as she pleases  so she has
broken most of the ten commandments and snapped her fingers in the face
of mrs  grundy  and now that she finds that her reputation is being
torn to tatters  she thinks that she is being most unfairly treated 

 oh  how i hate the whole tribe of kitty cats   she wails   oh  how
hard  and cruel  and unjust people are   then she asks   don t you
think that gossip is the unpardonable sin  

not at all  gossip is one of the most powerful influences in the world
for good  it is the invisible  omnipresent policeman that enforces law
and order  it is the scourge that keeps the trembling wretch in order
and makes the weak kneed and the wobbly walk the straight and narrow
path 

we can stifle the voice of conscience  but we can t silence the voice
of our neighbors  we can dope ourselves into believing that we have
a right to make our own code of conduct  but we can t force the
community in which we live to take our point of view on the matter  or
to make any exceptions in our behalf to the standards that society has
set up for good behavior  and it is this fear of what  they ll say 
that makes us curb our appetites and passions and keep up at least an
outward show of decency  for no matter how vain and egotistic we are 
no matter how self complacent and self satisfied we are  no matter
how independent we think we are  we are all cowards who grovel in the
dust before public opinion  it is the lifted eyebrow  it is the cold 
measured  appraising look that weighs us in the balance and finds us
wanting  it is the turn of a shoulder away from us and the little hush
that falls on a group as we approach that tells us that we have been
the subject of unfavorable discussion  which we dread more than we do
the wrath of god 

it is the knowledge that she will be gossiped about if she indulges
in any flirtations which keeps many a bored young married woman with
romantic yearnings from indulging in little affairs with good looking
bachelors  she knows there might really be no harm in her having lunch
with mr  a  or going to the theater with captain c   but that she could
never explain it to the woman who lives across the street 

and the next time the current events club meets she knows that she will
be the current event of burning interest discussed  therefore she turns
down the alluring invitations and stays at home  and minds her p s and
her q s and her babies 

and it is the fear of gossip that makes many an indiscreet girl watch
her step and saves her from the stumble that would land her in the pit 
she is easy going and good natured  and warm hearted and affectionate 
and she sees no harm in letting boys that she likes kiss her and
fondle her  but it makes the flesh creep on her bones to think of the
amalgamated scandal mongers  union getting out their hammers and going
for her if she does  she knows well enough that the neighbors on either
side keep tab on what hour her beaux go home and what goes on as they
sit on the front porch or stoop of an evening  and she conducts herself
accordingly  there is no chaperon so efficient as mrs  grundy 

if we could only do as we pleased and get away with it without any
censorious comments from our fellow creatures  there would be many
more philandering husbands and wives than there are  many more girls
wandering down the primrose path  many more neglected children and
ill kept houses  many more wife beating husbands and virago wives  it
is the knowledge that  if they give way to their natural impulses  they
will be talked about  which gives many would be sinners the strength to
resist the temptation to be as bad as they would like to be 

the people who think it is so wicked to be talked about are only
those who have something to hide  something that reflects on their
character  it is our bad deeds we don t want discussed  we are tickled
to death to have our good ones broadcasted to the ends of the earth 

no man objects to having it told about that he is a model husband  a
good provider and a tender father  the thing he wants hushed up is that
he half starves his family in order to spend the money on a flapper  no
woman wants to put the soft pedal on the conversation when her friends
are telling what a wonderful wife and mother she is  but she doesn t
know how women  who call themselves her friends  can be catty enough
to whisper behind their hands that she went out joy riding with young
snookums and didn t get home until   in the morning  while the baby was
nearly dying with the croup 

those who are down on gossip and feel that the world should cover up
their shortcomings with a blanket of silence are unreasonable  why
should other people be more careful of your reputation than you are
yourself  if you do not care enough for your good name to protect
it  why demand that service of the general public  foolish and vain
expectation  for the gossipers keep on their good work  and the only
way you can escape being talked about is to be so exemplary that you
are a dull subject for conversation

the lucky working woman


why do we hold to the theory that work is a blessing to men  but a
curse to women  we know beyond all questioning that the necessity of
earning his bread by the sweat of his brow was the consolation prize
that adam was handed along with his eviction papers when he was turned
out of eden  we know that the only happy man is the busy man  we know
that only in constructive labor does a man find an interest that never
palls and a game in which there is a perpetual thrill  we know that
work is the greatest anodyne for sorrow and the best protection against
temptation  we know that  as stevenson says   if a man loves the labor
of any trade apart from any question of success or fame  the gods have
called him  and he is of all men most enviable  

so manifold are the benefits men derive from work  so salutary are its
effects upon them  that we have a contempt for the idle  purposeless
man and feel that  no matter how much money he has  he has no right to
spend his life in loafing  we are eager to get our boys to work  so
that their restless young energy may find a legitimate outlet  instead
of being employed in devising new forms of dissipation  the young man
must have something to do  and if he isn t bending his back in honest
farming he will be breaking his neck in sowing a wild oats crop 

our attitude  however  toward women and work is diametrically opposite 
we do not regard work as a good thing for women  on the contrary  we
consider it a misfortune for a woman to have to work  we have even
coined a phrase for it and speak of the woman who must earn her own
living as a  poor working woman   worse still  the woman who works
pities herself  the mother whose daughters go down to business every
morning bewails their fate and feels that destiny has dealt most
unkindly by them  the woman who must do her own housework  and look
after her own babies  and make her own clothes sheds barrels of tears
over her lot 

men also accept this view of the situation that labor is a curse to
women  and work themselves to death in order that their wives and
daughters may live in parasitic ease  with servants to wait upon them
and have nothing to do but kill time  in fact  the consensus of opinion
seems to be that the ideal state for a woman is that in which she never
performs any useful labor  but merely sits on a silk cushion and feeds
upon strawberries  sugar and cream  all of this is a distorted view of
the situation  women need to work just as much as men do  idleness
has just as disastrous an effect upon the feminine character as it has
upon the male  and among women  as among men  the only happy  contented
ones are those who are so much engrossed in some useful labor that they
haven t leisure in which to consider whether they are satisfied or not 

mother  poor marys  and  poor sallys  her daughters who have to earn
their living  but nowhere else will you see healthier  happier girls
than those holding down good jobs in stores and offices  nine times out
of ten the girl behind the counter is brighter  more alert  and finds
life a far more entertaining proposition than does her purposeless idle
sister before the counter 

nor is the domestic woman who has to do her own housework entitled to
shed any tears of self pity on our necks  there is no more reason why
a husky young woman shouldn t do her share of the work of the domestic
partnership than there is why her husband should not do his  it is no
more of a hardship for her to have to work than it is for him  and many
a rich old woman who sits now with empty hands that ache for occupation
will tell you that her happiest days were the busy  crowded ones when
she got up at five o clock to cook her husband s breakfast before
he went to the factory and sat up until eleven o clock washing and
patching his clothes so that he could make a decent appearance next day 

it is a significant fact that the women who fill sanitariums and
enrich nerve specialists are not the overworked  hard driven wives and
mothers  they are the middle aged and elderly women  who have nothing
to do but to canvass their systems for symptoms of every disease they
read about in the magazines  it takes leisure to develop invalidism 
busy people keep well because they haven t time to be sick 

nearly every man s ambition is to keep his wife in idleness  and he
thinks that he is being a good husband when he can boast that she
hasn t a thing on earth to do but to amuse herself  it is pathetic
that the thing that so many good husbands strive for is their undoing 
for it is the idle women who are the peevish  fretful  discontented
wives  it is the idle women who run off with all sorts of fool fads
and fancies  it is the idle women who decide that their good  honest 
hard working husbands are not their real soul mates  and who get into
scandals with jazzhounds and elope with romantic looking sheiks they
have picked up in hotel lobbies 

the idle woman is never a happy woman  having nothing to do but to
think about herself  she is sure to prod around in her mind until
she finds a grievance  having nothing to do  she is sure to get into
mischief  having no interesting occupation  she begins to hunt for
thrills  and the net result is that she works harder trying to amuse
herself than she would at scrubbing floors  and the only reward is
that life is flat  stale and unpalatable in her mouth 

let us hope that the time will soon come when we will have enough
intelligence to perceive that work is a woman s salvation even as it is
a man s  and when we will congratulate the woman with a job instead of
pitying her

an indoor sport


this is a sad world  mates  with too little sunshine in it  so far
be it from me to abridge  abate or curtail any innocent pleasure  but
it does seem to me that there are certain diversions that should be
indulged in only in the privacy of home  one of these is the family
spat  apparently a large number of men and women get married for the
sole purpose of providing themselves with a sparring partner  with whom
they can put on the gloves at a moment s notice with  or without  the
slightest provocation  life has no dull moments for them  because they
are always saying something that draws blood  or framing a retort that
will cut to the quick  and the excitement of a battle to the death is
perpetually thrilling their nerves 

without doubt  it is a merry and adventurous existence for the doughty
domestic warriors who enjoy that kind of thing  i would not be cruel
enough to deny them the cheery pastime of going to the mat over every
trivial difference of opinion  but i do contend that conjugal quarrels
are an indoor sport that should be pursued only when the participants
have sought the seclusion that the cabin grants  as they used to say
in  pinafore   and when all the shades have been pulled down and the
keyholes stuffed with cotton 

possibly the lack of an audience might take off a little of the edge of
the bout for the battling husband and spouse  but  oh  how immeasurably
it would add to the comfort and happiness of those of us who are the
innocent bystanders and who are forced to look on  sick with horror 
at these encounters  in all good truth i know of no other situation so
miserable and so embarrassing as to be called upon to referee a fight
between a married couple  their quarrel is  to begin with  a matter
with which we have no concern  one in which we do not desire to meddle 
one in which we ardently wish to take neither side  it makes us feel as
if we were cowards to keep silent while a man hurls deadly insults at
his wife  and we writhe in vicarious shame while a woman vituperates
her husband 

we have the sense of having assisted in an indecent orgy when a husband
and wife strip every rag of reserve away from their relationship and
fling open the doors of their skeleton closets  and rattle their bones
in public  nor are we consoled by the knowledge that the people who
make public exhibitions of their tempers must enjoy doing so or else
they would not do it  yet we all number among our friends  husbands
and wives  otherwise estimable and charming individuals  who always
stage their fights in the most conspicuous place they can find  and
who seem to prefer an audience to privacy  when you meet them for an
evening s diversion they are having a preliminary set to  perhaps the
husband has come home late from the office  or has forgotten to mail
a letter  or possibly the wife has kept her husband waiting while she
did her hair over the second time  during the selection of the dinner
they get warmed up to the work and put in some punches with real steam
behind them  they clinch  and bite  and gouge over the selection of a
play  and they reach for each other s vital spots and get in dirty jabs
at the supper dance that follows the play 

doubtless the fighters are enjoying themselves  but a pleasant time is
not being had by all  the abashed onlookers know not what to do  they
do not know whether to rush in and make it a free for all fight or to
try to mediate between the warring couple  or whether to pretend to
have been suddenly stricken deaf  dumb and blind  and they wind up by
feeling outraged that they should have been placed in such a mortifying
position  and wishing heartily that husbands and wives would keep their
quarrels for home consumption  and not inflict them on their friends 

the same strictures apply to the woman who henpecks her husband  that
also is one of the quiet home joys that should be strictly confined
to the domestic circle  i raise no voice of protest against the woman
who has wit and strength and determination enough to oust her husband
out of his position as head of the house and assume it herself  it is
a matter between the husband and wife  and if he hasn t enough spunk
to fight for his rights he deserves to lose them  but why cannot the
bossy women be content with exercising their tyranny quietly and
unobtrusively  why do they insist upon rattling the chains by which
they lead their husbands until they call public attention to them 

think of the women you know who always say  my house    my car    my
children   who always walk ahead of their husbands and point out a
seat  and say   john  sit there   and who always tell john where to
get on and where to get off  and think how all the rest of us are
embarrassed for poor john  believe me  dirty linen should be washed at
home  and family quarrels staged there  that is one of the main things
for which homes are designed

should women tell 


i get a great many letters from women who write that there is a dark
stain on their past life  in the headstrong folly of youth they took
a step down the primrose path  then repented of their sin  and turned
their back upon it  and laid hold upon righteousness 

sometimes nobody knows of the slip but the girl herself and the man who
was her partner in wrong doing  sometimes a woman who had mired her
skirts to the knees has washed them clean with her tears of remorse 
and had the courage to build anew her life in some place where her
early escapades are unknown 

then love comes to these women  good men offer them marriage and an
honorable place in society  and the question they ask is  shall they
tell these men the story of their life before they marry them  or bury
the secret in their heart  and leave the matter on the knees of the
gods 

this is a problem no human wisdom can solve  for  so far as the
woman is concerned  it is a case in which she will be damned if she
does  and damned if she doesn t  her chances of getting happiness or
misery through opening up her skeleton closet and exhibiting its
contents to the man who has asked her to be his wife are about even 
with the odds for happiness slightly in favor of keeping the lid
clamped down good and hard on her secret 

the question of right does not enter into the matter unless you
institute a prematrimonial confessional in which men shall bare their
souls as well as women  there is no more real reason why a woman should
tell a man every detail of her past than there is why he should tell
her of every time that he has strayed off of the straight and narrow
path 

it is true that a couple who knew the worst of each other would start
out their life together on a firm foundation of honest understanding 
but nobody can claim that it would make for their felicity  or increase
their affection for each other  on the contrary  they would have swept
away every illusion  they would have destroyed the faith of each in the
other  and they would have called into being an evil spirit  a ghost
out of the past  that they could not banish  and that would forever
stand between them 

men have had the wisdom to perceive this  they realize that what a
woman doesn t know doesn t hurt her  but that the thing that she does
know she worries herself to death over  and so few men are foolish
enough to furnish a wife with a working diagram of their past lives
with which she can torture herself  and them  they draw a discreet
veil over episodes that are best forgotten  anyway  and deal only
in glittering generalities in referring to their gay bachelor days 
moreover  women are sensible enough to let it go at that  no woman
wants her husband to tell her things that stab her every time she
thinks of them  and that eat like a canker into her memory 

it is only when the case is reversed  and when it is the woman who has
a blot upon her past  that she wonders if it is the right thing  the
honorable thing  to tell the man who wants to marry her about it  of
course  the woman is bound in this by the double code of morals  which
makes one standard for the woman and another for the man  and that 
humorously enough  makes a husband feel that he has been exceedingly
ill used if he discovers that his wife has a past that matches his own 

therefore  because she is afraid that in future years her husband may
find out about her past life  or else driven by her conscience  or for
the sheer relief of sharing her burden with another  the woman nearly
always tells everything to the man before marriage  sometimes it drives
him from her  sometimes he loves her enough to marry her  in spite of
her revelations 

but  while he forgives  he never forgets  always he is haunted by the
memories of what she has revealed  he never trusts her  never wholly
believes in her  and he has to be a bigger souled man than most men
are if he does not reproach her with her past  and use it as a whip of
scorpions to scourge her with when he is angry with her 

of course  when either a man s or a woman s past life has in it some
sinister curse that reaches out and lays a hand on the future of the
one he or she marries  he or she is bound in honor to tell the other
one about it  but when there is nothing of this kind  nothing but a
youthful folly  a mistake  a blunder in the dark  bitterly repented
of and lived down  it seems to me the part of wisdom for both men and
women to forego post mortems  and to wash the slate clean and make a
fresh start 

what they have done does not matter so much as what they are going to
do  and it often happens that just because a man or woman has stumbled
in the past they walk the more carefully among the pitfalls of life 
and that out of the sorrows and repentance for their sins they have
brought a tenderness  a compassion  a forbearance and an understanding
that makes them better men and women than the vast majority of those
who have lived blameless lives 

confession is always weakness  the brave soul keeps its own secrets 
and takes its own punishment in silence  it takes a strong man or woman
to keep from blabbing  but it pays never to tell anything that you do
not wish the world to know

domestic boredom


the thing that oftenest makes marriage a failure is its dulness 
the real specter on the hearth is that awful silence  it is because
husbands and wives have nothing interesting to say to each other that
they quarrel  it is no joke  it is a sad truth  that in any theater or
restaurant you can spot the married couples at a first glance  they are
the couples who are sitting up reading the program through from cover
to cover between the acts  or are apparently memorizing the menu while
the waiter brings their order  the alert  interesting  smiling people
who are gayly chatting together are the unwed  or those who are talking
to other people s husbands and wives 

let even a bore drop into a droopy  dejected family circle that has
been yawning itself to death and everybody brightens up and the stream
of conversation which had apparently dried up at its source begins to
flow again  two may be company and three a crowd before marriage  but
generally after marriage two is gobs of silence and three a godsend 

yet the majority of people marry for companionship  before marriage
they could never get enough of each other s society  and they esteemed
each other perfect spellbinders  how is it  then  that they get so fed
up on each other s company that they sit up like mutes in the solitude
of their homes  why is it that  apart from fault finding and spats and
complaints about the servants and the tradesmen and bulletins about
the children  there is so little family conversation  practically none
that is interesting and cheerful and inspiring  you would think that
a husband and wife who have all interests in common could never talk
themselves out  but they do  and they come to the place where they take
refuge behind the evening paper or in solitaire to save themselves from
the pretense of even having to maintain the appearance of keeping up
social intercourse 

wives lay the blame for this state of affairs on their husbands  they
say  heaven knows  that they would be glad enough to talk  but that
you can t maintain a conversation with a person who always grunts by
way of reply  and who could give a clam on ice points on silence and
then beat it at the game  men retort that they have exhausted their
conversational powers during business hours  and they desire to rest
their vocal cords at home  nevertheless  it is observable that if
somebody interesting happens to call  or they go out to dinner  the
very man who was silent at home finds plenty to say 

now there are several reasons why there is so little conversation in
the home  the first reason is because home talk is so often unpleasant 
women  especially  are prone to flavor it with gloom  they like to
recite the litany of the day s mischances  they spoil the flavor of a
dinner by telling how much it cost  they bring on a scene with a child
by telling of its naughtiness  they thrash over their old grievances
because they can t have what richer women have 

all of this gets on the husband s nerves  and he retorts by saying a
few pithy things about what a fool a man is to marry and burden himself
with a family and what a poor manager his wife is  and he gives a
few knocks to the dinner for good measure  after which conversation
naturally languishes 

another reason that there is little conversation at home is because it
is dangerous  experience teaches us that we have to watch our tongues
and delete our home talk if we want to save ourselves from endless
trouble 

a man hates to lie to his wife about what he does  he would enjoy
telling her all about the poker game he stayed downtown for last night 
and the funny things the boys said and did  but he does not do it
because well he knows that the price of such an indiscreet revelation
would be to have her nagging him about it forever and a day  a wife
would just love to tell her husband about her adventures in buying a
new hat  and how she fell for the twenty five dollar one instead of the
fifteen dollar one she meant to buy  but she is well aware that she
would never hear the last of her extravagance if she did  so they both
keep silent 

there is little home conversation because nobody is interested  and
nobody pretends to be  in what you say  in the family circle nobody
listens  nobody laughs at your jokes  nobody sees the points of your
merry cracks  try to tell a good story  and somebody is sure to remark
that they have heard it before  and that it is an ancient wheeze  if
you had discovered the north pole and were relating your hairbreadth
adventures in reaching it by airplane  somebody would interrupt at the
most breathless moment to say that the iceman forgot to deliver the ice
yesterday 

wives won t listen even when their husbands try to tell them about
their hopes and plans and ambitions in their careers  and when a
woman tries to talk to her husband about the things that are of vital
interest to her he falls asleep and snores in her face 

and that is why conversation is a lost art in the family circle

to marry or not to marry 


a young woman once said to me 

 i am  as you know  the private secretary of the head of a very big
business concern  i get a generous salary  my hours are easy  my
employer  who is an elderly man  is one of the finest men in the world 
and treats me with every courtesy  kindness and consideration  i feel
it a privilege to be in daily contact with such a brilliant mind as he
has  i love my work  i have what they call in men a business head  to
me there is no other romance so fascinating as the romance of commerce 
no game so absorbing as the business game  and it thrills me to the
finger tips to know that i have a part  even if it is a small one  in
this great adventure that sends men and ships to the uttermost parts of
the earth and that gambles for fortunes 

 it gratifies my vanity to know that i have worked up from the bottom
to my present fine position  and it pleases my ambition to know that i
can climb still higher  and that every year i will be more efficient
and more valuable to my employer  i enjoy the money i make  and the
luxuries it brings me  as only a woman can who comes of a poor family 
and whose girlhood has been barren of all the pretty things that girls
crave  i find a lot of solid satisfaction in watching my bank account
grow  knowing that  if i keep on with my job for a few years  i will
have put by enough to safeguard my old age 

 so far  so good  if i were going to remain perpetually on the sunny
side of forty  i would ask no life better than that of the successful
business woman  but the dread hour will strike for me  as it does for
all other women  and i am wondering if  when it does  i will not find
myself a lonely old woman  and wish that i had married and had children 

 i am thirty now  and i have got to decide the question in the next
year or two  shall i give up my mahogany desk for a gas range  shall
i forfeit my fat pay envelope for a job where i shall have to toil
ten times as hard for only my board and clothes  shall i give up the
occupation for which i spent years in preparing myself  for which i
have talent and which is a joy for me to perform  for domestic service
which i loathe  for which i have no aptitude and in which i am utterly
unskilled 

 when i see my sister shabby  bedraggled  overworked  with her crying
babies and grouchy husband i feel like clinging to my good  soft  easy
office position with both hands  then rises that specter of the future
in my pathway  and i wonder if in staying single i will miss the best
that life has to give to a woman  and if i will regret it if i refuse
to follow the traditional career of my sex 

 of course  i know that there are women who try to have their cake 
and eat it  too  who grab matrimony with one hand  and hold on to
their jobs with the other  but my observation is that they always
fall between the stools  they are failures both as business women and
as wives and mothers  for to succeed in anything you have to give
everything that is in you to it 

 no woman is of much use in an office when nine tenths of her brain and
all of her interest are back home in a cradle and she is worrying over
whether a hired nurse is giving the baby its milk  nor can any woman
who comes back home at night  with a worn out body and jangled nerves 
be anybody s ideal of a wife and mother 

 so as far as i am concerned i have to decide the question which i am
going to be  a business woman or a domestic woman  before i take the
fatal step  and for the life of me i can t make up my mind which to do 
to marry or not to marry  that is the problem that i am acquiring gray
hairs and wrinkles debating 

 of course  if a fairy prince should come along and say   come and be
my queen  and ride beside me in my limousine and tour the world with me
on my yacht   i should doff my cinderella working suit and put on my
glass slippers  and step out with him 

 but it is only in novels that millionaires espouse poor working girls 
the men who come a courting me are just ordinary young chaps on small
salaries  whose wives will have to do their own cooking  and wear
hand me downs 

 nor would there be any difficulty in settling the question if i had an
overwhelming passion for some man  then i would cry   all for love and
my job well lost   and a two by four flat would look better to me than
to be president of the greatest corporation in the world  but i am not
really in love  i have merely an affection for a certain chap that i
might possibly cultivate into a warmer emotion if i decided that it was
better  after all  to marry 

 but it is cruel  isn t it  that a woman has to choose between marriage
and her career  when a man marries he merely annexes a home and wife
and children to the pleasures and interests of his work  but a woman
has to sacrifice one or the other  and i don t know which one to
choose  

 and whichever way you decide  you will be apt to regret it   i replied
consolingly

woman s greatest gift


a man told me the other day that he had not married until he was
forty five years old because he was determined not to marry any woman
who did not have a sense of humor  and it took him that long to find
one 

a wise man  a very solomon among men  may his tribe increase  it is a
million times more important for a woman to have a well developed funny
bone than it is for her to have a grecian profile  yet when men go to
marry they pick out a girl for a wife because she has melting black
eyes  or soulful blue eyes  without ever once observing whether the
said eyes look on the funny side of life or take a dark  pessimistic 
bilious view of it  which is one of the reasons that domestic life is
no merry jest to the average husband 

a sense of humor is desirable in a man  but it is absolutely essential
for a woman to have a sense of humor if she is to be an agreeable life
partner  because a woman s existence is made up of little  nagging
things  at which she must either laugh or cry  and if she can t laugh
them off  they get on her nerves  and she goes to pieces 

it is the neurotic  haggard women  who can t see a joke even after it
is diagrammed for them  who fill the insane asylums and the sanitariums
and divorce courts  the women who wear the smile that won t come off 
and whose laughter is set on a hair trigger  get to be fair  fat and
forty  and you couldn t pry their husbands away from them with a
crowbar  it is the lack of a sense of humor that causes women to make
tragedies instead of comedies out of trifles 

take the servant trouble  for instance  women worry themselves sick
over the mistakes of a green maid  and it never occurs to them that the
very blunders that they are shedding tears over are screamingly funny
contretemps that they pay out money to see imitated in a sketch on the
vaudeville stage 

of course  no one wants the soup to be seasoned with sugar instead of
salt  nor the waste paper basket to be put on the mantel as a parlor
ornament as a perpetual thing  but the mistress who can get a laugh
instead of a sick headache out of the mistakes of her norah or dinah 
fresh from ireland or the cotton fields  saves her own face and that of
the maid whom she later trains into being a good servant 

moreover  a woman with a sense of humor can take the curse off of even
bad cooking  for there is not one of us who would not rather sit
down to a boiled dinner with a jolly woman  full of good stories and
anecdotes  than to attend a banquet where the hostess is gloomy and
peevish and whiny  and who frets with her children and spats with her
husband 

whether a woman makes a success or failure of matrimony depends
altogether on whether she has a sense of humor or not  if she can
see her husband as one of the most mirth provoking  side splitting 
uproarious human jokes that nature ever perpetrated she will be happy 
and he will bless heaven on his knees for having given him the paragon
of wives  but if she sees him as an awful problem  or a subject for
reformation  neither one of them will ever know a happy hour  and the
marriage will either end in a divorce court or a long endurance contest 

the women who wreck marriages are the ones who take their husbands
seriously  and who get tragic every time their husbands look at another
woman  or play a little poker  or fail to come home at the appointed
hour  and who weep when their husbands forget an anniversary  or fail
in some little attention they consider their due  the women who keep
their husbands enslaved from the altar to the grave are the women who
laugh with their husband over their little faults and peculiarities 
they make a joke of their husband s weakness for a pretty face  they
have a dozen funny stories to tell about how they helped their husbands
out of scrapes  and  instead of feeling ill used and assuming the pose
of a domestic martyr when their husbands forget their birthdays  they
go out and buy themselves a particularly nice present  which they pay
for without a murmur because they know that a wife with a sense of
humor is worth anything she costs 

a sense of humor is even more necessary to a mother than it is to a
wife  the humorless woman takes her children too tragically  they wear
her out  and she alienates them from her by her ceaseless nagging
because she thinks that every little foolish thing they do is full of
direful significance  the mother with a sense of humor knows that youth
is as subject to certain follies as it is to the mumps and the measles
and the whooping cough  and that it must go through these experiences 
as it did through the cycle of infantile diseases  but that they are
not fatal if they are carefully watched 

she may not approve of all the manifestations of flapperism and
jellybeanitis  but she knows that the remedy for them is laughter and
not tears  and so she keeps her young ones in bounds with good natured
ridicule  nor does she break her heart with dismal forebodings about
the terrible fate that is bound to overtake boys and girls who do
not dress and act as did their grandparents  she has seen too many
silly young people develop into fine men and women to borrow trouble
worrying over what is going to become of the race 

in its last analysis  a sense of humor is just the sense of proportion
that enables us to see things in their true relation to life  it is the
thing that keeps us from making mountains out of molehills  and that
gives us the courage to smile instead of cry  happy the woman who has
this gift  and thrice happy the man who gets her for a wife 




xxiv

grafting on the old folks


it is a curious thing  in a way it is a beautiful thing  and it s a
selfish thing  that children rarely ever think of their parents as
human beings  children think of their fathers and mothers as the source
whence all blessings flow or they think of them as an avenging justice 
but it seldom occurs to them that their parents are men and women  in
addition to being parents  that they have the same preferences and long
for the same pleasures as other people  and that they have a few rights
that even their children should respect 

of course  a small child unquestionably takes for granted all that
its parents give and do for it  it is merely the order of nature that
mother should appear at its bed with the cup of water for which it
cries out in the night  that mother should clean up the dirt it brings
into the house and spend hours over the stove cooking the things it
likes to eat  and that father should work while it plays and go shabby
to give it fine clothes 

as they grow up  children continue to demand more and more of their
parents  they bleed father and mother white for the things they want 
they are not intentionally cruel  but they will take the last dollar
they can wring out of the family purse without ever once thinking that
father and mother might like to spend some of the money they earn
on themselves and in gratifying their own desires  and  curiously
enough  even after they have grown to man s and woman s estate  the
great majority of people still hold to this point of view about their
parents  in regulating their lives  they do not take their parents 
rights into consideration  they do not say   my father and mother have
sacrificed enough for me  they have done enough for me  now i will
stand on my own feet  and be as little a burden as possible to them  

of course  the most flagrant illustration of this is found in the
loafer sons and daughters who let their old parents work and support
them  we all know husky  able bodied young men who play golf while
father slaves in an office  and strapping big girls who perform on the
piano while mother is performing on the gas range  apparently  it never
crosses the mind of these despicable young people that after they are
old enough to support themselves they have no right to sponge upon
their parents  and graft their living off them  still less do they ever
think that mother and father would like to take things easier as they
grow older  and indulge in a few of the luxuries they have had to deny
themselves while they were raising and educating their children 

another illustration of how little children regard the rights of their
parents you may see in the nonchalance with which young mothers turn
over their children to their own mothers  when sally wants to go to a
bridge luncheon or maud wants to take a trip  they dump the children
down on mother  when clarabell wants to go to europe for the summer 
she doesn t worry at all as to what to do with the children  she leaves
them  with a thousand instructions as to diet and clothes  and manners
and morals  with mother  so that in innumerable families mother becomes
nothing but a sort of universal nursemaid 

it would shock these daughters to be told what a mean  selfish thing
they do in not standing by and doing their own baby tending as mother
did hers  they  themselves  know what it is to walk the colic what
broken nights mean  how incessant must be the care given little
children how nerve racking children s noise is  yet they foist this
burden on mother without a pang of compunction because they are so used
to seeing her doing everything for them 

it never occurs to them that she would like to fold her hands in a
little peace and rest  furthermore  that she has earned it by bringing
up one family  and her daughters haven t any right to make her
substitute on raising another one 

then there are the children who lay their matrimonial burdens on their
parents  john gets married before he is earning enough to support a
family  susie marries a ne er do well  in spite of all efforts to
prevent it  fanny discovers that the man to whom she is married is not
her soul mate  and gets a divorce  and comes back home with two or
three children  none of these selfish young people  bent on gratifying
their own desires  considers father s and mother s rights in the
matter  yet the parents  in the end  are the real sacrifices 

they can t let john and his wife and children starve  and so the money
that father and mother had saved up for their old age goes in pittances
to help him along  they can t shut the door in fanny s face when she
comes back with her divorce and her half orphaned children  so father
works harder  and mother pinches and economizes more to raise and
educate this second family that their children have thrown upon them 
surely there is no other thing that children need to realize so much as
that their parents have some rights  perhaps if they understood this 
and that after a man and a woman have raised a family of children they
have a right to peace and quiet and their own money  there would be
fewer parasitic sons and daughters 

perhaps  if they realized that parents had rights  more young people
would consider how their marriages would react on their parents  and
many a disgruntled wife would carry on with a marriage that wasn t
perfectly congenial rather than burden her old parents with her own and
her children s support

are you a good father 


are you a good father to your daughter  mr  man  you smile derisively
at my question  a good father to your little girl  you ll tell the
world you are  why  she is just the very core of your heart  and there
hasn t been a blessed thing that she has wanted since the day she was
born that you haven t given her  why  you have almost broken your neck
trying to get the moon for her when she cried for it  pretty dresses 
fashionable schools  good times  her own car  far more luxuries than
you could afford her  you have lavished upon her without stint  you
have kept her wrapped in cotton wool  and she has never known there was
such a thing as work or responsibility or self denial in the world  you
may have failed in many other directions in doing your full duty  but
you can pat yourself on the back and thank god that you have been a
good father 

well  let me tell you that if all you have done for your daughter is
just to pamper her and spoil her and make her weak and selfish and
self centered  you have not been a good father  you have been the
worst sort of father  you have never looked upon your daughter as
anything but a pretty doll to dress up and play with  and dolls cannot
take care of themselves in the rough and tumble fight of life  sooner
or later they are apt to get broken 

let me tell you what i consider a good father  a good father is a man
who doesn t look upon his daughter as a toy or a piece of bric a brac 
but as a human being who has been born with the heavy handicap of the
feminine sex upon her  that means that she will always be less strong
than a boy  less capable of taking care of herself  in far more danger 
fewer opportunities will be open to her  and many more perils beset
her than would a boy  therefore  she needs more protection  she needs
to be better trained to deal with the world  so the good father sees
to it that his girl gets the very best education that she will take 
not the flubdub  fluffy ruffles sort  but a solid  practical education
that develops whatever gray matter she has got in her pretty little
head  that teaches her to think and reason and that gives her a solid
foundation on which to rear her house of life 

then the good father has his daughter taught some profession or trade
whereby she can earn a living  and he has her follow this occupation
for at least a year  he does this for many reasons  he does it because
he knows how easily money is lost  and he wants to know that his
daughter has in herself the skill and ability to make her own living
if she is ever thrown on her own resources  he does it because he knows
the knowledge that she can stand on her own feet and earn her own bread
and butter and cake  gives a girl a poise nothing else in the world
can give  he does it because the discipline of a business office 
the experience in handling money and an insight into the troubles
and problems of men are the best preparation any girl can have for
matrimony 

a good father chums with his daughter  he begins being confidential
with her in her cradle  and this makes it natural that when she grows
up she should discuss with him the boys who come to see her  and that
father should be able to form her tastes and assiduously guide her in
her choice of a husband  girls know nothing about men  it is impossible
that they should  but there is nothing about any young chap that father
can t find out  and if he knew that this youth had a hectic past  or
that one drank  or the other one was a trifling ne er do well  it would
be the simplest thing possible to prevent many an unhappy marriage
by making daughter see a suitor through the sophisticated eyes of a
worldly wise man  instead of the romantic ones of a young girl 

a good father tries to protect his daughter after he is dead  so  when
he makes his will he leaves her whatever money he has to bequeath her
tied up good and tight in a trust company so that she cannot touch
anything but the interest  he knows that every woman who has any
money is the foredoomed prey of get rich quick sharks and all of her
parasitic relatives  he has seen too many women sell their gilt edge
bonds and invest the proceeds in wildcat stock that promised to pay
   per cent and never paid a penny  he has seen too many women lend
their money without security to deacon jones  because he prayed so
beautifully  or to uncle john  because they didn t have the nerve to
say  no  to a member of the family 

above all  a good father leaves his daughter s money in trust for her 
not only to save her money but to save her from friction with her
husband  he has seen many a man graft his wife s fortune deliberately 
and he has seen many more good men  who were poor business men  bring
their wives to poverty  and he knows that it takes more backbone than
the average woman possesses to hold on to her money when the man
she loves is continually asking her for it  so father saves her the
necessity of any arguments on the subject  are you doing these things
for your daughter  mr  man  are you a good father

the moral muscles of your children


the most overdressed and overindulged children are those whose parents
were poor in their youth  the most undisciplined and uncontrolled
children are those whose parents were reared in strict and stern
households  when you see a little girl playing around in a befrilled
lace and embroidered dress and silk stockings  you do not need to be
told that at her age her mother wore gingham and went barefooted  when
you see a young boy splitting the road open in an imported car you
know that when his father was a lad he trudged on foot to the factory
with his dinner pail on his arm  when you see ill mannered young
people who smoke and drink and carouse and recognize no law but their
own pleasure  who run roughshod over the rights of others  who have
no respect for age  and who either patronize their parents or treat
them with contempt  you know that they are the offspring of fathers
and mothers who were given few privileges when they were young and who
were coerced by determined and strong handed parents into walking the
straight and narrow path 

nothing is more common than to hear people say   i don t want my
children to be denied things as i was in my childhood    i don t want
my children to have to work as i did when i was a child    i don t want
my children to be suppressed and tyrannized over as i was when i was
young  

indeed  so common is this feeling that sometimes it seems that the
present generation is being brought up by the rule of contraries  and
that the only fixed idea that many parents have is to rear their sons
and daughters exactly opposite from the way they were reared  to give
them everything they didn t have and to let them do everything they
were not permitted to do 

there is something very pathetic in this  it speaks so eloquently of
the ungratified cravings of childhood  of the weariness of little hands
that never knew any playtime  of the thwarted desires for pleasure
at the time of life when one is mad for amusement  and it is easy to
understand why parents whose own childhood was stinted and dull should
want to lap their children in luxury and give them all the fun they
missed  but in trying to save their children the hardships they have
gone through  they are also cutting their sons and daughters off from
the experiences that make such men and women as they are themselves the
kind of men and women who rise from poverty to fortune and from
obscurity to fame  for it is not in the lap of ease that successes
are made  it takes struggle and self denial and discipline to form
character 

that is why we have the proverb that it is three generations from shirt
sleeves to shirt sleeves  the poor man by energy and industry piles
up a fortune  but because he has had to work and save in his youth he
teaches his children to be idlers and wasters and spenders  and they
run through their fortune and their children must go to work again at
the bottom of the wheel  probably the children of the self made man
have naturally just as much ability as he has  but they nearly always
amount to nothing  because their foolish father has denied them all
the advantages he had when he was young and he has enervated them with
indulgences 

people who have been brought up in puritanic homes almost invariably
let their children run wild  they put no restraints upon them  they
demand nothing of them  they resent the lack of liberty they had in
their youth  and so they give their children license  they do not seem
to realize that the system at which they rail made good citizens 
instead of the hoodlums which they are turning out  they do not reflect
that they owe their health and strength to clean living  that because
they were made to do things they formed habits of industry  that
because they were made to do hard things just because it was a duty to
do them they developed the grit which keeps men and women from being
quitters  that because they were taught obedience and self control they
became captains of their own souls and masters of their fate  instead
of being the playthings of their passions and emotions 

they must know  if they stop to think at all  how much better fitted
they were to meet life  how much more secure they were of happiness
than are their children  who have never been taught to do anything
they do not want to do  or to deny themselves the gratification of any
appetite or desire 

for life doesn t change  the world does not alter and no matter how
much we would like to soft pad existence for our children and stand
between them and every hardship and sorrow  we cannot do it  at the
last  in one way or another  they must come to grips with fate  and
when they do the weak and dissolute will perish  the spendthrifts will
come to want  the self seekers will have their hearts broken 

of course  it is a great temptation for parents to lavish upon their
children everything that money will buy  and it is much easier to give
strong willed youngsters their heads and let them go their own gait
than it is to hold them in check  but that way destruction lies for
the child  and this is something that parents  who are denying their
children the struggle of life that made them what they are  might well
reflect upon

the mother in law


undoubtedly there is no other thing over which so many tears are shed
and which is such a potent source of discord and misery as in laws 
innumerable young women have the happiness of their youth wrecked by
their quarrels with their mothers in law  innumerable old women have
their last days made bitter to them by the knowledge that they are
unwelcome guests in their sons  houses and that their daughters in law
hate them  innumerable men are made miserable by being torn between
the two women they love  who fight over them like dogs over a bone 
discussing this subject the other day  a woman who is a mother in law
said 

 like everything else  the mother in law question is a fifty fifty
proposition  and when they don t get along together both are to blame 
certainly it isn t an easy thing for a woman who has run her own
house and been at the head of everything to take a back seat in her
daughter in law s home  and it isn t easy to forget that your children
are your children and to keep hands off in their affairs and treat
them with the formality you would strangers 

 on the other hand  most daughters in law meet their mothers in law
with a chip on their shoulders and are always hunting for trouble  they
seem to feel that when a man marries he should forget the mother who
bore him and wipe out the memory of all the years of close association
that there has been between them  they are even jealous of the
slightest attention and consideration that their husbands show their
mothers 

 they seem to forget that if it wasn t for these much resented
mothers in law they wouldn t have any husbands at all  and that the
better husbands they have the more they owe to their mothers in law 

 for if a man is tender  and kind  and generous  and considerate to
his wife  it is because his mother has taught him to be chivalrous to
women  she has trained him to be a good husband just as she has trained
him to be a good citizen  and he honors and respects his wife because
he so greatly honors and respects his mother 

 you never saw a bad son who was a good husband  you never hear of a
man who abused and cursed his mother  and regarded her as only a slave
to wait upon him  who didn t treat his wife the same way  and so we
mothers who raise up clean  straight sons  who enter into marriage with
high ideals and a determination to cherish their wives and make them
happy  have done the girls who get them such a service as they could
not repay if they were down on their knees before us the balance of
their days 

 but if any daughter in law has ever lifted her voice in thanks to her
mother in law for teaching her son to be unselfish  or to be generous
with money  or to pay her the little attentions that women love  i have
never heard of it 

 and there is another queer thing about daughters in law  they seem to
think that marriage should obliterate a man s past and break all the
ties of his life 

 he and his mother may have been the closest of companions  he may have
asked her advice on every subject and talked over all of his plans with
her  but woe be unto all concerned if he tries that after he takes a
wife 

 ninety nine times out of a hundred the wife grows green eyed and
considers it rank treachery to her  and for the sake of peace mother
and son have to forego the little talks that were such a joy to them
both or else do this stealthily and hold a stolen rendezvous 

 yet it does look as if any woman who wasn t a moron would have sense
enough to see that any man who could forget his mother and all he owed
to her would be such a disloyal creature that he would forget his wife
when some younger and fairer woman came along 

 of course  the chief charge that our daughters in law have against us
is that we are always meddling in their affairs  perhaps we do  but
aren t our children s affairs our affairs too  hasn t the mother who
has raised her son to manhood and who has made him strong and capable
of earning a fine salary a right to say something when she sees his
hard earned money being wasted  his home neglected and his health
ruined by bad cooking 

 if a mother saw her own daughter treating her husband that way  she
would rebuke her and show her where she was making a fatal mistake  and
the daughter would not resent it  why can t a daughter in law take the
same advice and profit by it  instead of flying at the throat of the
mother in law and considering herself a martyr to mother in lawism 

 of course  there are exceptions to all rules  i know daughters in law
who are real daughters to their husbands  mothers  i even know
daughters in law who have borne with angelic patience cranky women
who could not even get along with their own daughters  and i know
mothers in law whose presence is like a benediction in a house and
others who are firebrands wherever they go  so perhaps there is no
way to settle the question so long as we are all human and not female
saints  but god pity the mother who is obliged to live with her
children  no matter how kind they may be  she is always the fifth
wheel  and feels it  perhaps those savages who kill off all the old
people haven t such a bad plan of disposing of the question  after
all

why our families rile us


a woman wants to know why it is that we find it harder to get along
with our families than we do with other people  and why our own
blood and kin rile us more than anybody else on earth  probably the
main reason why we find it so difficult to live in peace and harmony
with those who are really near and dear to us is because we are too
much alike  we have inherited the same traits of character  and when
these come in collision there is a resounding crash  and the noise of
wrecked tempers and exploding wrath 

father  an iron willed  tyrannical gentleman  who has ruled his little
world like a despot  cannot get along with john  who is of the same
fiber  and equally determined to have his own way and do as he pleases 
father and john may have a very sincere affection for each other and
admire each other s good qualities  but they can never be together an
hour without getting into a fight over something 

mother is a born manager  one of the ladies who honestly believe 
with the famous frenchman  that she could have saved the almighty
from making some mortifying mistakes if she had been consulted at the
creation  mary is mother s own daughter in her perfect belief that she
knows exactly how to run the universe  what wonder  then  that they
clash over every gown and hat that is bought  over every man that comes
to see mary  over everywhere that mary goes 

sometimes the reason that we can t get along with our own people
is because we are so entirely different from them  often and often
children are changelings  and those of our own flesh have no tie of
spiritual kinship with us  the father who is a hard headed  practical
business man has nothing in common with the son who is a quivering
bunch of nerves and sensibilities  who is a dreamer of dreams  and who
counts wealth in terms of beauty  instead of dollars  mother  who was
a beauty and a belle in her day  with scores of lovers sighing at her
feet  has looked forward to reliving her triumphs in her daughter  and
when daughter grows up to be a big  sturdy young person who wants to
go into business and who loathes society  what wonder that they get on
each other s nerves 

when you hear parents speak bitterly of what a disappointment children
are  and how ungrateful  it merely means that their children are
different from them  john insists on being a doctor or a lawyer instead
of going into the hardware business father has been building up for
him for twenty years  mary wants to marry a poor young man  instead of
the nice  settled  rich widower mother has picked out for her  other
people find john brilliant and talented  father calls him a fool to his
face because he won t do father s way  other women are sympathetic with
mary s romance  and her willingness to sacrifice riches for love  it
infuriates mother to see her throwing an establishment and pearls and a
limousine away  for a sentiment 

often the reason we cannot get along with our own families is because
they are like a mirror in which we see our own faults in all their
hideousness  father s lack of ambition that has kept him from making
anything of his life  mother s shiftlessness and wastefulness that have
kept the family poor  brother s brutal temper  sister s sharp tongue
that cuts like a two edge sword these irritate us  and we find them
harder to forgive than we would such defects in other people because we
know that we are  ourselves  prone to just these weaknesses 

besides these fundamental reasons why it is hard to get along with our
relatives  there are a thousand minor causes of discord  one of the
principal ones is the lack of politeness in the family circle  for most
people feel that good manners are like good clothes  and should be worn
only for the benefit of company  it is an amazing but true thing that
practically the only people who ever say mean  insulting  wounding
things to us are those of our own household 

strangers listen to us with apparent interest  and laugh at our
jokes  our friends compliment our new frocks and cars  if our casual
acquaintances do not like our taste or respect our judgment  they keep
silent about it  it is our families who stab our vanity to the quick
by yawning in our faces  and asking us if we are going to tell that
old story over again  who bluntly inform us that our new hat is ten
years too young for us  and that there is nothing so ridiculous as old
women trying to be flappers  who criticize the way we are raising our
children  and tell us the home truths we would rather die than hear 

still another reason why it is hard to get along with our families is
because it is generally held that the mere fact that you love people
gives you a perfect right to nag them  we speak of family ties as
binding  binding is right  for in the average home no one can rise up
or sit down  eat or fast  go or come  without having to give an account
of why he or she did it or didn t do it  and being advised to do it
some other way 

it is for these  and a thousand other reasons  that we find it
difficult to get along with our families  and fly to those who do not
feel that they have a right to boss  correct  advise or otherwise
interfere with us in the pursuit of life  liberty and happiness

our lives are what we make them


you have been in factory towns where more or less benevolent
corporations have built rows upon rows of houses  each one as like
its neighbor as peas in a pod  but one house would have dirty 
grimy  unwashed windows  with old newspapers or rags stuffed in a
broken window pane  the yard would be filled with old cans and ashes
and refuse  and the place would look like a shack  unfit for human
habitation 

the house next door would have bright and shining windows  with clean 
freshly starched muslin curtains and a gay red geranium in a pot
showing between them  flowers would be blooming in the yard  and a
vine trained over the doorway  and the place would be a home  bright 
cheerful and attractive  yet the two houses were exactly alike  the
only difference was in what the people in them made of them 

one cook can take a cheap cut of meat and a handful of vegetables and
make of them a ragout  over which an epicure would smack his lips 
another cook will take the same meat and vegetables and make of them
a watery stew  with neither flavor nor nutriment to it  it is the same
material  but the difference is in the cooks 

that is the way it is all through life  there are a few fortunate
individuals who seem to be the darlings of the gods  and with whom lady
luck walks hand in hand  and there are also a few miserable ones who
appear to have been born double crossed by fate  but the great majority
of us get a pretty even deal  we have the same family relationships 
we go to the same schools  we have the same chance to work  and the
balance is up to us  we are happy or miserable  successful or failures 
rich or poor  according to what we make out of our lives  we marry 
millions of us  and set up homes  one out of every seven of the
marriages ends in divorce  more than three fourths of the homes are
wrecked  not because there is anything especially wrong  not because
either husband or wife is an outbreaking criminal  but because they are
too ignorant or too selfish to make their marriage a success 

all husbands and wives are cut off the same bolt of humanity  no man is
perfect  no woman is an angel  no domestic machine runs along without a
jar or a hitch  every marriage calls for sacrifices  for patience  for
forgiveness  endurance  and you get out of it just what you put into
it heaven or hell 

you go to homes that simply irradiate peace and love and good
cheer  where there is a happy and contented man  and a smiling and
blissful woman  where there are fine children growing up in the right
atmosphere  and you go to another home that is a place of torment 
where a surly man snarls and snaps  and a disgruntled woman whines and
complains  and unruly  uncontrolled children fight like the kilkenny
cats 

yet both of these families started out with the same equipment  both
couples were in love when they were married  both had about the same
amount of money  both were called upon to make the same sacrifices 
both had the same chances at happiness  yet one made a success of
marriage  and the other failed 

we talk about opportunity  and when we fail we lay the blame on luck 
we say we never had a chance  but the truth is that we are our own
luck  that we make our own opportunities 

did you ever think that every day in the year there are thousands of
green country boys going into every big city  seeking their fortunes 
and thousands of city boys leaving those same cities because they think
that everything is overcrowded and overdone  and that they have no
opportunity there  and many of those country boys will find the chance
the city boy overlooked  and pick up the fortune he passed by 

the world is full of failures  croaking that there is no money in
farming or the mercantile business  and warning young men that they
will starve if they become lawyers  or doctors  or actors  or writers 
or artists  yet there are rich farmers with bursting granaries 
everywhere millionaire business men  there are world famous lawyers and
doctors and matin e idols and men who write best sellers 

and the successes are side by side with the failures  working in the
same environment  under the same conditions  and the only difference
is the difference in the men themselves  it is the difference in the
energy  the grit  the determination  the stick at iveness  the heart
and soul and brains that one man put into his work and the other
didn t  whether we are happy or not depends upon ourselves  for in
reality we all have pretty much the same raw material with which to
work 

sickness  suffering  the death of those we love  disappointment 
come to us all  the poorest woman alive and the millionairess bear
their children in the same agony  and weep the same tears over little
coffins  money does not buy love  tenderness  nor peace of mind  and
just as many hearts ache under silver brocade as under cotton 

but we can hold our souls serene if we will  we can keep from fretting 
we can resolutely extract the sweet instead of the bitter out of life 
we can dwell on our blessings instead of our miseries  and we can
acquire a philosophy that will enable us to laugh instead of weep over
the misadventures that befall us 

for our lives are what we make them  it is all up to us

husband losers


three divorced women were talking together the other day and one of
them said 

 when we wives lose our husbands we always accuse some other woman of
having stolen them from us  and we cry out that our husbands are cruel
ingrates  who have taken the best years of our lives and then thrown
us aside like broken toys when we were no longer young and beautiful 
and we pose as blameless martyrs who are the pitiful victims of man s
perfidy 

 of course  it saves our faces to be able to lay all the blame for our
wrecked homes on others  and it soothes our hurt vanity to be wept over
as a poor  innocent  deserted wife  but in the still watches of the
night  when we have it out with our own souls  there are mighty few of
us who can shrive our consciences and know that we are blameless 

 most of us know in our heart of hearts that if our husband s love
died  we did our part in administering the lethal dose  we may have
done it through ignorance  through carelessness  through blundering
stupidity  we may have even done it with the best intentions in the
world and with the firm conviction that we were forcing down their
throats a remedy that would cure them of all the little ailments and
weakness of character from which they suffered  but the point is  we
did it  we were accessory to the crime  and we could have prevented it
if we had so wished 

 now  as you know  my husband forsook me for his secretary  i called
her a thief who had used her position to rob me of a husband and my
little children of their father  and i looked upon him with bitterness
and contempt  as a poor weakling who let an adventuress make him forget
his honor as a man and his duty to his wife and children  i called
heaven to witness that i was innocent and that i had been a good  true 
virtuous woman  who had always done her duty to her family  it took me
a long time to see that  if my husband grew weary of me  i had made
him tired by my incessant nagging and fault finding  that if he ceased
to love me  it was because i was no longer lovable  and that the other
woman had not really stolen him from me  i had simply handed him over
to her on a silver salver 

 you see  i was one of the wives who did not realize that it is easy
enough to get a husband  but the work comes in in keeping one  i
thought that after a woman was married she could let herself go  and
so i never bothered to keep myself dolled up at home  or to try to
make myself pleasant and agreeable  i went in negligee  both as to
clothes and manners  any old rag was good enough to wear at home  any
disagreeable topic was a suitable breakfast table discussion  and i
felt perfectly free to quarrel with my husband  and criticize him  and
ridicule all of his little faults and idiosyncrasies 

 i forgot that he went from a sloppy wife to an office where a trim 
perfectly groomed woman  younger and better looking than i  waited
for him  i forgot that he went from my nagging and fault finding to a
girl who was paid to agree with him and whose job depended largely on
her flattering him and telling him how wonderful and great he was  it
wouldn t have been human for him not to constitute a daily comparison
between us  and it was inevitable that when he did  that i should lose
out  if i had kept my doors locked and my burglar alarms in working
order no one could have looted my home  and so i am just as responsible
for the wreck of it as are those who broke it up  

 my husband was a gay  pleasure loving man   said the second divorcee 
 he always wanted to be going somewhere  he loved to be in the thick
of crowds  he adored dancing  and restaurants  and the bright lights 
he loved fine clothes  and always wanted me to look like a fashion
plate  now  i am a serious minded woman and was brought up to take a
serious view of things  and i felt it my duty to cure my husband of
his frivolity by leading him up to what i considered the higher life 
i began by trying to wean him away from his old friends  on whom i
turned such a cold shoulder that they soon ceased coming to the house 
i lectured him about his extravagance and the way he threw away money 
and finally got possession of the family purse and doled out dimes to
him  i wouldn t go out with him of an evening  and i rarely let him go
without a scene  at first he submitted  but he looked bored and sulky 
and then he broke out of jail  which was all his home had come to be to
him  and that was the beginning of the end 

 for  of course  when i wouldn t play with him he found some other
woman who would  and who wouldn t wet blanket every occasion by her
moral strictures or spoil every meal at a restaurant by looking at the
pay check  if i had been willing to flatter him  and jolly him  and
dance with him  and let him spend his money on me  he would never have
left me  but i wouldn t do it  and my austerity got on his nerves  he
wanted a playmate instead of a censor  and so i feel that i am just as
much to blame as he was  

 i lost my husband through ambition   said the third divorcee   he
was an artist of great talent  and i was mad for him to win fame and
money  so i never let him rest  i prodded him on all the time  i was
forever a goad in his side  and so i became to him a sort of incarnate
conscience  a perpetual reminder of all the unpleasant duties of
life  he was temperamental  a child of impulse  and i became his
task mistress  a slave driver to him  finally he got to the place
where he could stand it no more  and he eloped with a young girl as
irresponsible as he was  she will never push him on to success as i
would have done  but she lets him follow every whim and she will hold
him  as i could have done if i had had intelligence enough to see that
you can t make a work horse out of pegasus

clever mary who  take it from me  knows her way about was talking about
her friend  martha  the other day 

 of course  martha is the perfect housewife   she said   but she
is a mighty poor wife  without doubt  she is a great and glorious
housekeeper and a cook and baker and cleaner  never have i seen a
rumple in her curtains  her bedspreads are like the driven snow  and
you could eat off her floors  her house is so immaculate that her
husband must feel a perfect stranger in it  and like a bull in a china
shop 

 but her days are so taken up with work that she has time for nothing
else not a minute to read or to play  or to be a companion to her
husband  in fact  she is so worn out by the time night comes that she
is too tired to do anything but go to bed 

 her husband loves to read  but if he sits up late  the light annoys
her so much that she can t sleep  so she says  so she nags him until
he gives it up in disgust  she  herself  never reads anything except
the advertisements of the department stores in the papers  and the
thrilling accounts of vacuum cleaners and patent breakfast foods in the
backs of the magazines  and when her husband tries to talk to her about
the things he is interested in books  sports  his business he had just
as well try to ring any other dumbbell 

 now  i do all my own housework  and i must be a fairly capable
housewife  for my mother in law has put her o k  on me  and that
settles that  but there isn t a spot in my house where we can t park
ourselves at any time  my library table is filled with books and
magazines  and if husband drops ashes and scatters the sunday papers
all over the place  i let him  and gently and painlessly remove them
after he has passed on 

 i don t really know anything about sports  i wouldn t recognize a
home run if i met it on the street  but when hubby wants to talk about
baseball i assume an intelligent expression  and i am never too tired
to play with my husband  i grab my hat the minute he suggests the
movies  i can get ready to go anywhere in an hour  i just adjust my
complexion martha considers that a real vice and we are off 

 martha can t understand why my husband very rarely goes away from
home of an evening and almost never without me while hers beats it
to the corner drug store as soon as he has eaten his superexcellent
dinner  and i just can t make her see that it is because she puts her
house before him  she worships cleanliness and order  and sacrifices
everything to them  the first thing martha knows  she is going to lose
her husband  and she will go around wailing and weeping and telling how
hard she worked and what a good housekeeper she was  she never will
know that she literally drove him away from her with a broom handle 

 i told martha the other day that if she would spend less time
polishing her mahogany and more time polishing her finger nails and
rubbing up her mind  it would be better for her  but she just smiled
that superior smile that a model housekeeper always bestows on the
woman whom she suspects of having dust on the back pantry shelf  and
made a dive for a basement sale of somebody s patent cleaning fluid  

mary is right  cleanliness and order are two of the domestic virtues
that may easily be converted into vices  we all know spick and span
houses that are no more homes than a shiny tin box would be  nobody
would dare disarrange a sofa cushion in one of them  nobody would have
the courage to move a chair from its appointed place  to track a bit of
mud on one of the shining floors would be a high crime and misdemeanor 
to leave anything hanging around would be a sacrilege unspeakable 

husband and children flee these temples of order and cleanliness as
they would a torture chamber  and they live in dread and fear of the
woman who has worked herself cross and irritable attaining her ideal of
housewifery  most of the real homes are places not too bright and good
for human nature s daily use  they are places where you can take your
ease  places run on a flexible schedule and only reasonably clean and
orderly 

doubtless  the old lady who laid down the maxim   feed the brute   as
a rule for retaining a husband s affections said a wise mouthful to
women  but more is to be added  for man does not live by bread alone 
and it is just as important to feed his soul as his stomach  every
woman who fails to give her husband good  nourishing food fails as a
wife  but she fails even more if she does not give him companionship 
for  after all  there is a good restaurant on every corner where a man
can satisfy his physical hunger  but none but his wife can minister to
his spiritual hunger  foolish is the woman who doesn t realize this and
who spends her time keeping her house clean instead of making it a home 

but that is the trouble with matrimony  a woman can t be either a
martha or a mary  to be a good wife she has got to be both

the t  b  m  at home


a man wants to know if i don t think his wife is very wrong and foolish
to be hurt and offended because he is often irritable and cross at
home  he says that she knows that he adores her  and that he is a model
of all the standardized domestic virtues  but that he works all day
under a terrific strain  and by the time night comes his nerves are
worn to a frazzle  he thinks that his wife should appreciate this  and
that instead of further rasping them with argumentation  she should
apply a soothing emolument to them 

i agree with the gentleman that it is always the part of prudence for
a wife to give the soft answer that turneth away wrath  instead of
retorting with a snappy comeback when her husband makes a nasty crack
at her  it certainly doesn t add to the peace and harmony of a home
for a wife to be ready to jump into her fighting clothes every time
her husband makes a pass at her  nothing comes of family rows but
bitterness  and anger  and disillusion  nor does any love long survive
them 

i also agree with the gentleman that any woman who has cut her wisdom
teeth on matrimony should be able to assay her husband s temper
and tell how much of it is due to raw nerves and how much to pure
cussedness  and so know when to spread the salve and when to hand him a
solar plexus blow  furthermore  i opine that a wife who starts anything
with her husband at evening until after he is fed and rested  and has
had his smoke and his paper unmolested  deserves to be put in the home
for the incurably feeble minded for the balance of her natural life
or else bound over by the courts to keep the peace  for she is either
lacking in brains or just loves a fight for the fight s sake 

it is the greatest possible pity that women haven t more sense of humor
than they have  for if they did they would be able to laugh at many
things their husbands do over which they shed scalding tears  it would
enable them to see how really funny it is for a big man to get into a
babyish tantrum over nothing and how much easier it is to kid him out
of it than it is to make a scene over it  unhappily  however  few women
have a funny bone  and fewer still can see the joke when it is on them 
and so husbands and wives meet temper with temper and irritability with
irritability  and the domestic war goes merrily on 

the mistake that most wives make is in taking their husbands too
seriously  they have heard so much about the mighty masculine
intellect that they think their husbands are profound  thoughtful human
beings who mean every word they say and whose every act is part of a
deeply considered plan of life  whereas the truth is that men babble
just as meaninglessly as women do  and are the creatures of impulse 
also  women are under the misapprehension that they have a monopoly on
nerves  and that hysterics are the sole prerogative of the feminine sex 

these beliefs make women attach a significance to the things that men
say and do to which they are not entitled  and it makes them  get their
husbands wrong  and break their hearts over crimes that the poor 
blundering men do not even know that they are committing 

in consequence whereof the wife s feelings are in a constant state of
laceration  and she meets each hard knock with a still harder one  or
else goes off and salts her wounds down in the brine of her tears 

now  no one will argue that a human cyclone is a pleasant companion
to live with  nor would any sane woman pick out a man who is giving
a life like imitation of the day of wrath with whom to spend her
evenings  but  all the same  women make themselves unnecessarily
miserable by taking their husbands  humors too seriously 

the cruel speeches that stab the wife to the soul are not prompted by
malice toward her  they are the reaction of nerves that have been
frazzled to the breaking point by the worries of the day at the office 
the frozen silence which the wife finds it so hard to endure is just
sheer exhaustion of mind and body  and the woman who can just take her
husband s moods this way can not only save herself many a tearfest  but
can make her husband eat out of her hand by feeding him and laughing at
him and jollying him along 

certainly  the woman who is married to a nervous  overworked man might
well do a little mental balancing of accounts and check off a lot of
temper  and impatience  and unreason  and fault finding against the
finery he gives her  and the success he has achieved  of which she is
so proud and which he has literally bought with his life s blood  she
might well forgive his faults and deal leniently with them  since they
are the direct result of his struggle to lap her in luxury 

she is  believe me  a discerning and a tender wife who answers her
husband s irascible speeches with a pat on the head and a  there 
there  it s all right   as she would a sick and fretful child  instead
of going to the mat with him 

so much for the wife s side of the question  now for the husband s 

business furnishes no alibi for surliness  and grouchiness  and
general disagreeableness  no man has a right to come home at night
and dump down on his own hearthstone all the nerves  and temper  and
irritability he has kept bottled up in him all day 

because a woman has the misfortune to be a man s wife is no reason he
should insult her and say to her things that he would not say to any
other woman who had an able bodied brother  or that he would not dream
of saying to any woman who had     to spend across his counter  or who
was his client  or his patient 

if a man can control his temper and his tongue in dealing with the
outside world  he can control it still at home  if he can be polite and
courteous and flattering to other women  he can make the same gracious
speeches to his wife  instead of growling like a bear when she asks
him a simple question  and if he has any sense of honor  he will be
the more careful of what he says to his wife than he is to the others 
because his attitude means nothing to them  but his wife s whole
happiness is dependent on the way he treats her 

nor does the fact that he overworks excuse a man s irritability at
home  nine wives out of ten would rather have a little more amiability
from their husbands and less money  if they had to choose between the
two  the beloved husbands and wives are not those who work themselves
into a state of nervous irritability for their families  they are those
who keep themselves calm  and good natured  and pleasant to live with 

to expect other people to overlook our temper and forgive the cross
and cruel speeches that we flash out at them without provocation is
demanding too much of human nature

don t be afraid to let your husband see you love him


a woman asks this question   is it wise for a wife who loves her
husband devotedly to let him see how dear he is to her  does the
knowledge that her heart is his for keeps make him undervalue it  does
she best keep his interest in her alive by keeping him on the anxious
seat  after all  a husband is still a man  and we know that before
marriage the more difficult a woman is to win the more a man chases
her  and the more a woman throws herself at a man s head the more
adroitly he dodges her  so the question is  does this same state of
affairs continue after marriage  do men want their wives to blow hot
and cold  as they do their sweethearts  or do they desire them to be a
good  steady  reliable fire on the hearthstone  

a man s attitude toward love undergoes a complete change on his wedding
day  during his courtship  the thing that has been of more importance
to him than anything else in the world has been the state of mind
of his lady love  it has been a wonderful  sentimental adventure
following all her moods and tenses  and plumbing the depths of her
emotions  it has roused his sporting blood for her to be coy and
difficult  taking her away from his rivals was a game of fascinating
intrigue  and he thrilled with the sense of being a conquering hero
when she finally surrendered to him 

but marriage is another pair of sleeves  it is a different
story altogether  a man marries to end romance  not to have it
to be continued in our next serial that will run on the balance of his
life  he wants to be done with doubts  and fears  and heart burnings 
and speculation about the woman he loves  so that he will be free to
give his undivided attention to his business 

therefore the tactics that won a woman a husband do not serve to hold
him  and the wife who tries to pique her husband s interest in her by
her flirtations with other men is more apt to land in the divorce court
than to strengthen her position in the domestic love nest  for men do
not wish to be kept guessing about their wives  they want to be sure
of them  the man who is married to a woman who plays around with other
men and who keeps him on the ragged edge of nervous prostration with
jealousies and suspicions does not think that he has drawn a capital
prize in the matrimonial lottery  on the contrary  he thinks that he
has been gold bricked  and he is not crazy over his bargain 

no woman need be afraid to let her husband know how much she loves him 
because her love makes the strongest claim she can possibly have upon
him  many a man who has made an unsuitable marriage with a woman with
whom he had no real companionship  many a man who has outgrown the
woman he married in his youth  is kept faithful to her by the knowledge
of her devotion to him  it takes a brute to hurt the one who worships
you  or to leave the one whose whole life is bound up in you 

nor is there any charm of mind or person that appeals to a man so
much as just the certainty of a wife s love and the sure knowledge
that if all the world turned against him  there is one who would
still be standing shoulder to shoulder with him  some one who would
go down to the gates of death with him  or wait outside of the prison
gates for him  some one whom neither disease nor poverty nor disgrace
would alienate from him  the coquettish woman who thinks to keep her
husband s affection for her at fever heat by keeping him uncertain of
her has no such hold upon her man as has the wife whose husband s heart
doth safely trust in her  sure that whatever else fails him in life 
her love will never fail 

a wife need not be afraid to show her husband her love  because men
are just as heart hungry as women are  they crave affection and
appreciation just as much as women do  and they long just as much as
women do to be petted and fussed over 

no complaint is more common from women than that their husbands stop
all love making at the altar with a suddenness that jars the very
marrow of their bones  they say that the men to whom they are married
never seem to think that they long to be told that they are still loved
and admired  and that they have made good as wives  they yearn for a
kiss that is warm with passion  instead of a duty peck on the cheek
that has about as much flavor to it as a cold batter cake 

but  apparently  it never occurs to these wives who are starving for
some sign of real living affection themselves that their husbands are
also on the bread line  mutely begging for a stray crumb of love  they
do not realize that a great big  husky  successful man could want to
be chucked under the chin  and babied  and told that he was the most
booful thing on earth  and that his wifeikins got down on her knees and
thanked god every night because she was lucky enough to get him  and
that every day  in every way  she loved him better and better 

yet there isn t a man in the world that wouldn t worship a wife who
handed him that line of chatter  and who wouldn t walk mighty straight
and reverently before one who opened the doors of her heart and let
him see that he was enshrined therein  no  no wife need be afraid of
letting her husband know how much she worships him  for it is love that
makes the world go round  and that greases the wheels of matrimony

queer things about marriage


did you ever think how many queer things there are about marriage  to
begin with  isn t it queer that we permit boys and girls to get married
at an age at which they are not permitted to make any other binding
contract  the law appoints guardians to look after the property of
minors  and prevent them from squandering it  or being cheated out of
it by sharpers  but there is no legal safeguard to save foolish girls
and boys from throwing away their life s happiness on an ill advised
marriage 

at a time of life when we consider a lad s judgment too immature for
him to make a thousand dollar investment  we assume that he is worldly
wise enough to pick out a life mate  at an age when we think a girl s
taste too unformed and too hectic to select her own clothes  we let her
choose a husband 

isn t the casual attitude we take toward matrimony queer 

marriage is the most important act in our lives  the thing that not
only makes or mars us  but that affects thousands of people yet to be 
compared with marriage  being born is a mere episode in our careers 
and dying a trivial incident  yet there is no other thing that we do to
which we give as little intelligent  serious thought 

if we were going into a business partnership to invest our entire
fortune  we would think a long time before we committed ourselves  we
would consider the proposition from every angle  we would look into its
weak spots and try to form an honest opinion of its chances of success 
and we would investigate the past record of the man we were proposing
to go into business with  and find out everything about him 

we would ascertain what sort of a life he had led  how honest and
honorable he was  how much he was to be trusted  and what sort of a
disposition he had  whether he was pleasant to get along with or not 
yet the worst harm that our business partner could do us would be
to cheat us out of our money  he couldn t break our hearts and make
our lives miserable  if we didn t like him  we could dissolve the
partnership without any trouble or disgrace 

but nine times out of ten those who enter into the marriage contract 
which is the most binding contract of all  do not take the trouble to
make even the slightest investigation about the one with whom he or she
is making a life partnership  every day we read of people who discover
that they are married to bigamists  every day some husband stumbles
into his wife s skeleton closet  and finds that the woman whom he
believed pure and innocent has a dark and sordid past  every day some
agonized mother looks at her deformed or idiotic babe  and sees that
the sins of the father have been visited on her child 

the man was handsome  and he danced well  and he had a dandy sport
model car  the girl was pretty  and she had a cute trick of looking
up through her lashes  or a baby stare  so they got married without
bothering to find out a single thing about the kind of life each
had led before they met  they wouldn t have bought a house without
having had an expert see that its title was clear and that there
was no mortgage on it  but they will marry without finding out what
sort of encumbrances are on the lives of their husbands and wives 
they wouldn t buy a horse or a dog without looking into its pedigree
and finding out what sort of stock it comes from  and whether it is
sound in wind and limb  but they will pass diseased blood on to their
children with no thought of the sort of heredity with which they are
cursing them 

isn t it queer that men and women fail to consider the dispositions of
those they marry  yet that is the thing that people have to live with 
and it is what makes marriage a success or a failure  it isn t high
and noble principles  it isn t truth and honor and honesty that makes
or mars a man s or woman s happiness in marriage  it is the temper of
their husbands or wives  a man may be a model of all the virtues  and
yet if he is stingy and grouchy and gloomy  his wife will be miserable
with him  a woman may be as chaste as c sar s wife  yet if she nags 
her husband will rue the day he led her to the altar 

all men and women know this  yet a girl will go along and marry a man
who even before marriage gets the sulks over every little thing that
goes wrong  with whom she has to always walk on eggs to avoid riling
him  and who carries his small change in a purse with a snap lock  and
a man will marry a thin  nervous  irritable girl  who is always getting
peeved about everything  and who never can say a thing and let it rest 
and they both wonder after marriage why marriage is a failure  and why
they can t get along together 

isn t it queer that people don t pick out the kind of husbands and
wives that they want  and that will suit them 

a man who is a student will marry a silly little girl who hasn t two
ideas in her head to rub together  in the days of courtship it was
inevitable that he should take the measure of her brainlessness and
find out that when he talked to her of books that he spoke of an
unexplored world to her  and that when he discussed the things in which
he was interested she yawned in his face  nor could he help perceiving
that her chatter was the chatter of a magpie  and the things in which
she delighted were things that bored him stiff 

his common sense shrieked to him that marriage between two people who
had not one single idea  nor an ideal  nor a thought  nor a desire  in
common was bound to be a failure  but the man  wise and sophisticated
in other things  but clinging blindly to his superstitious belief in
the potency of the marriage ceremony  refused to heed the warning 

somehow  he was confident that just getting married would change a
silly  ignorant girl into an intellectual woman who would be a fit
companion to him  miraculously render one who had never even read a
sixth best seller familiar with the world s best literature  and make
her prefer to discuss world topics to gossip about the people next door 

we wonder why poor men marry fashion plates  why men who love to eat 
marry girls who loathe the kitchen  why quiet  domestic men marry
girls who live to dance and go to cabarets  they are all poor  blind
heathen  trusting in the marriage ceremony to make an extravagant girl
economical  a frivolous girl serious  an undomestic girl domestic 

isn t it queer  not only do we superstitiously believe in the power of
the marriage ceremony to change other people  but we actually think it
will change ourselves 

the philanderer believes that he will never cast a roaming eye at
another woman as soon as he is married  the loafer believes that he
will be filled full of pep and energy by the mere fact of having a
wife to work for  the stingy  selfish man is confident that he will
enjoy spending money on his family  the girl who has never thought of
anything but dolling herself up and having a good time believes that
as soon as she is married she won t care any more for fine clothes or
going about  and that she will be perfectly satisfied to stay at home
and save her husband s money and cook him good things to eat 

but alas  the miracle of the marriage ceremony no more works on us than
it does on those we marry  long before the honeymoon has waned we make
the discovery that somehow the mysterious something that was to change
us didn t take  and that we are the same old individuals  with the
same old tastes and desires that we always had  then to so many comes
the cold  bitter knowledge that they are tied for life to one who is
utterly uncongenial  to one who bores them and gets upon their nerves 
and  queerest of all is it that no matter how unhappily people have
been married  when death or divorce sets them free  they nearly all
want to try matrimony over again

husbands the living conundrum


a woman writes me that she has been married to a man for sixteen years 
yet she has never got acquainted with him  she says he is good and
kind  but indifferent to her  he never finds fault with her and never
praises her  he spends his evenings at home by his own fireside  but a
mummy would be just about as conversational  all of this has got the
woman guessing  and she can t figure out whether her husband still
cares for her or not  or whether he regards his marriage as a success
or a failure 

good gracious  sister  don t imagine for an instant that you have
anything unique in the way of a husband  all men are full of curious
peculiarities  and no woman ever gets acquainted with one  no matter
whether she has been married to him for sixteen years or sixty  for  as
an old colored friend of mine says   husbands is the most undiscovered
nation of people there is  

no woman ever understands  for instance  why it is that a man who was
an ardent and impetuous wooer turns into a husband with about as much
sentiment and pep to him as a cold buckwheat cake  as soon as the
marriage ceremony is said over him  nor can she form any idea of why
the man who was willing to risk his life to get her takes so little
interest in her after he has got her  she cannot doubt that he loved
her  because he gave great and indisputable proof of that by assuming
her support for life  nor can she see any reason for his change of
attitude  she still carries the same line of bait with which she caught
him  she still has the same eyes that he likened to violets drenched
in dew  but he doesn t notice them  she still has the same white hands
that he used to hold by the hour  but if she wants anybody to hold them
now she has to hunt up some man to whom she is not married  no woman
can ever understand why a man doesn t put forth the same effort to make
his home a going concern as he does to make his business or profession
a success 

if every man tried to sell himself to his wife as he does to his
employer  or a big customer  or a valuable client  there would be no
disgruntled  dissatisfied married women in the world  if every man
studied his wife s peculiarities of disposition  if he played on her
weaknesses as deftly and handled her as tactfully as he does a merchant
who is about to place a big order  or a rich patient  every wife in the
land would be eating out of her husband s hand  if every man paid his
wife a fair wage for her services  as he does his stenographers and
clerks  it would take the heaviest curse off matrimony for millions of
wives 

but  altho to have a contented wife and a peaceful and happy home means
more to a man than to make a million dollars  not one man in a hundred
ever gives any real serious thought or makes any honest effort to make
his marriage a success  he leaves the most important thing in his life
to chance  and he wins out or loses  according to whether fortune is
with him or not  women never can understand why their husbands refuse
to handle them diplomatically  when it would be money in their pockets
to use the velvet glove instead of the strong arm method 

every man knows that he can jolly his wife into doing anything  and
doing without anything  he knows that if he hands her a few cheap
compliments about what a wonderful manager she is and how she helps
him  she will squeeze every nickel  every man knows that if he tells
his wife how beautiful and lovely she looks in her last year s dress 
she wouldn t trade it off for the latest paris importation  every man
knows that he can kiss his wife s eyes shut until she will be blind as
a bat  and that he has only to give her a warm smack on the lips to
make her dumb as an oyster 

and every wife knows that her husband knows these things about her 
because she has furnished him with a complete diagram about how to work
her  and she never knows whether to be mad at him or disgusted with
him  because he would rather fight with her and pay for it in having to
eat bad meals  and having his money wasted and buy her new frocks and
limousines and pearls  than to take the trouble to flatter her a little
and treat her the way she is begging to be treated 

most of all  women never can understand why their husbands are so
stingy with words  which surely are among the cheapest commodities on
earth  above everything else  every wife yearns for words of love  for
words of praise from her husband  just to have her husband pet her  to
have him say to her that she grows dearer and dearer to him every day 
and that he thanks god for giving her to him  pays any woman for all
the sacrifice  all the work  all the suffering that marriage brings
her  it makes her heart sing with joy  and the lack of it fills her
life with tears of despair 

every man knows this  every man knows that he can make his wife happy
with just a few words  and yet he withholds them  even the men who
really love their wives and appreciate all that their wives do for them
refuse to give the starving souls the words that would be the bread
of life to them  no  no wife ever gets acquainted with her husband 
husbands always keep us guessing to the end of the chapter  perhaps
that is why we all want one of these living conundrums

the power of suggestion


among my acquaintances is a woman who has a pretty little flapper
daughter  the girl is a good little girl  as playful and innocent as
a kitten  but she bobs her hair  and paints her face  and rouges her
lips  and likes to jazz  and joy ride  and have a good time just as
thousands of other girls of her age and class are doing  all this
greatly outrages the mother  who tells her daughter that  in her day 
decent girls didn t paint their faces  or shimmy  and that they stayed
at home evenings and read good books  instead of running around with
japanned haired boys  and then she winds up her preachment by accusing
her daughter of doing things which she does not do  and prophesying
that she will come to a bad end  of course  it is mother love and
mother anxiety that makes this woman keep continually before the girl s
eyes the fate of those who follow the road of pleasure  it never enters
her head that she may be precipitating on her child the catastrophe she
dreads  but that is precisely what she is doing 

she is making the girl feel that she is sophisticated and
worldly wise one of the wild  wild women  she is giving the flavor of
forbidden fruit to what would otherwise be harmless little amusements 
she is making the girl reckless  because she is making her believe that
she is under suspicion and is being talked about  worst of all  she is
firmly implanting in the girl s mind the idea that she is expected to
go wrong 

and if anything in the world will put the skids under a girl  it is
for her own mother to be continually impressing upon her that she is a
wrong  un 

when you observe the dealings of parents with their children the thing
at which you wonder most is that fathers and mothers never seem to
realize the power of suggestion  yet it is one of the most potent
forces in the world  and one that can be directed with almost uncanny
results to the molding and shaping of the characters of the young 
it is hardly too much to say that as the parents think  so are the
children  it is the fixed idea the parents stamp indelibly on the
plastic childish mind which determines the fate in life of the man or
woman 

you can  for instance  take a delicate child and literally  think  it
into health or sickness  if the mother keeps the child forever reminded
it can t do what other children do because of its poor heart  it can t
eat this or that because of its bad digestion  and that it mustn t
be crossed because it is so nervous  that child will grow up into a
neurotic invalid  but if the mother impresses on it the thought that
it is getting well  and is going to be strong and healthy  unless there
is something radically organically wrong  it will overcome the weakness
with which it was seemingly threatened 

all of us have seen people actually bring upon themselves diseases they
believed they had inherited  they had had it impressed on them from
their infancy that they were bound to die of consumption because all
the smiths had tuberculosis  or  that they were doomed to perish with
cancer  because cancer was in the jones family  or  to have rheumatism
because the simkins were all rheumatic  and they died of what they
believed to be inherited diseases that science has proved not to be
inheritable 

it is tragic to think how many parents have killed the children they
loved by putting the death thought upon them  and by making them
believe that they were doomed  and that there was no use in their
trying to be strong and well  it is still more tragic to think of the
millions of people who are failures in the world because their fathers
and mothers have sapped their courage  and slain their initiative by
implanting in their minds the conviction that they were dolts and had
not the ability to succeed 

once establish the inferiority complex in a child s mind  and it is
done for  it accepts the belief that it has no ability to do things 
and it attempts nothing  it makes no struggle to rise  it slumps
into the humble position its parents have assigned it  this is why
perpetual fault finding with a child intensifies its faults  to nag
johnny continually about his awkwardness  makes him still more awkward 
to be forever calling attention to tom s shyness  makes him shrink
more and more out of sight  to fret at bob s dulness  makes him feel
that there is no hope for a boy who isn t quick and alert  many men
never have the courage to demand their just deserts and take the place
to which they are entitled in business and society because they were
made self conscious in their childhood  they had it so impressed on
their minds that they were blundering louts  and stupid fools  that
they shrank within themselves  and never had the nerve to push their
fortunes 

and just as you can make a child a failure by holding the thought of
its inferiority before it  you can do much to make it a success by
holding the thought of achievement before it  we unconsciously strive
to be what the people about us expect of us  if jimmie knows that he
has a reputation for beautiful manners  he will act as a gentleman  if
tom knows you expect him to make a mark at school or in business  he
will try to make good  if mary knows you do not think it possible for
her to be anything but sweet and innocent  she is not likely to tarnish
your ideal 

the power of suggestion is so far reaching in its influence that
fathers and mothers should be careful how they use it  and avoid
implanting a weak thought  an evil thought  a thought of failure in
their children s minds as they would avoid giving them poison

woman s missionary opportunity


as a sex women are highly altruistic  there is scarcely a movement in
the world for the uplift of humanity or for ameliorating the sorrows of
the poor and helpless that does not owe its existence to women  it is
women who support the orphan asylums  the homes for old men and women 
the reformatories  the houses for the blind  the places of refuge where
the man just out of prison can go and gather himself together before
starting out on a better life  it is women who nurse in hospitals  and
who carry on mainly the work of the red cross and the fight against
the great white plague  joan of arc is the great feminine heroine 
the women that other women envy most are not the great beauties and
sirens of history  or the famous actors and writers  but the florence
nightingales and frances willards who have been able to do some great
service to their fellow creatures  and deep down in her secret heart 
if every woman was granted her one great wish  it would be to be able
to help her day and generation to make others happier  and to perform
some miracle that would make life easier for all who come after her 

well  little as she realizes it  that power is possessed by every woman
who has children  in her hands lies the remedy for the greatest sorrow
that tears at the hearts of men and women  she can wipe away half of
the tears of the world  she has the magic that can change innumerable
lives from misery to joy  for the greatest trouble in the world is
domestic trouble  the bitterest disappointment is a marriage that is
a failure  there is no place of torment so hard to endure as a home
of bickering and strife  no enemy can stab you to the heart as does a
cold  selfish  unkind husband or wife 

it lies within the power of mothers to put an end to all this misery 
to stop divorce and the breaking up of homes  and the orphaning of
helpless little children  it is in their power to provide every man and
woman with a good husband and wife  to make every home a prosperous and
peaceful one  and to save other mothers from the agony of seeing their
children mistreated by the men and women to whom they are married 
there is no more appalling thought than that every woman could raise
her children up to be good husbands and wives  and that she does not do
it  on the contrary  nine times out of ten she brings up her sons and
daughters to be exactly the kind of husbands and wives from whom she
prays god on her knees to deliver her own precious darlings 

most likely the woman is herself the victim of another woman s cruelty 
her own marriage has been wretched because her husband s mother never
taught him to treat women with any courtesy  or consideration  or
chivalry  he was never brought up to consider a woman s feelings  or
even to extend to her common justice  as a result  his wife has had to
walk on eggs to keep from rousing a demoniacal temper  she has had to
wait on him hand and foot  she has had to wheedle every penny out of
him  and never since her wedding day has her husband made one move to
entertain or amuse her  or done anything to make her happy 

it would seem that a woman who had been through the arid desert of such
a marriage would save some other poor girl from such a fate by raising
up her son to be a good husband  you would think that she would teach
him what a terrible crime it is to take a woman s life into his hands
and break it  that she would teach him to be gentle and tender to his
wife  that she would impress upon him that a woman earns her share of
the family income  and that it should be given to her outright instead
of being doled out as alms 

you would think that she would ground him  from his infancy up  in the
knowledge of all the little things that make a marriage a failure or
a success to a woman the little attentions  the little treats  the
word of praise  the compliment on a new dress or hat  the little things
that make a woman s heart sing with joy  and that makes marriage worth
while to her  the great majority of women  however  never even so much
as think of training their sons to be good husbands  nor do they train
their daughters to be good wives  very few mothers would be willing to
see their sons marry the kind of girls their daughters are 

mother has raised her daughters up to be selfish and spoiled and lazy
and extravagant  and she is ready to foist them without mercy on any
poor young fellows who are taken with their pretty faces  but heaven
defend her own boys from marrying girls who have never considered any
other human being in the world but themselves  and whose only law is
their own pleasure  you even hear mothers boast that they have never
taught their daughters how to cook  or sew  or keep house  yet the
very foundation of domestic happiness and the prosperity of the family
depend upon the wife being a thrifty manager and making a comfortable
home 

nor do women instil into their daughters  minds the truth about
marriage that it is an obligation that they take upon themselves  and
that they have no right to throw it up and quit because it is full of
hardships and self sacrifice instead of being the joy ride they thought
it would be  neither do mothers pass on to their daughters their own
hardly won knowledge of how to get along with a husband  how to bear
with him and forbear  how to jolly him and handle him with tact and
diplomacy  yet that precious bit of information would save many a
marriage  believe me that the most important question that any mother
can ask herself is this   am i raising up my son and daughter to bless
or curse the woman and man who marry them

how to be a good husband


a young man said to me the other day   i am going to be married  and
i earnestly and honestly desire to make my wife happy  but beyond a
vague and rudimentary impression that i must not beat or starve her  i
haven t an idea of how to go about the good husband job  what should a
man do to keep a woman blessing her lucky stars that she married him 
instead of wondering what on earth the fool killer was doing that she
survived her wedding day  

 well  son   i replied   your theoretical ground work for being a good
husband is a sound foundation on which to build  tho refraining from
beating your wife is not the matter of course thing that you seem to
think it is  there will be plenty of times when you will want to do so 
and bitterly regret that no perfect gentleman can lay his hands upon
a woman save in the way of kindness  no matter how much she needs a
thrashing or he yearns to give her one 

 while as for giving a wife sustenance and raiment  believe me  that
to be a good provider is one of the brightest jewels in the crown of
a good husband  no matter what other charms and virtues a man may
have  he is a poor makeshift of a husband if he cannot give his wife a
comfortable living  and  on the other hand  no man is a total failure
as a husband if he laps his wife in luxuries  jewels  and motorcars 
and fine houses  and fine clothes are a consolation prize that takes
the curse off many a woman s disappointment in marriage 

 having  then  accorded your wife considerate treatment and given her a
good home  the next step in being a good husband is to play fair with
her on the money question  get off on the right foot there and you
will save yourself endless bickerings and prevent her from feeling a
bitterness toward you that will grow and grow until it will kill out
all of her affection for you  the first disillusion that many a bride
gets is when she finds out that the prince of her dreams is a tightwad 
who haggles with her over the market money and who is so stingy that
he never gives her a penny of her own  there isn t a woman in the
world who is enough of a worm of the dust not to resent having to ask
her husband for the money she knows she earns as a housewife  so go
fifty fifty with your wife on the money proposition  give her as big an
allowance as you can afford and be decent enough not to ask her what
she does with it 

 the next item in being a good husband is to be affectionate to your
wife  don t expect her to take it for granted that you still love her
because you haven t applied for a divorce from her  you handed her a
fine and convincing line of love talk while you were courting her  and
there is no excuse for your cutting it off and becoming as dumb as an
oyster just as soon as you ve got her  no normal woman can live without
love and be happy  it is just as necessary to her well being as food
and drink  and if she is deprived of it she suffers all of the agonies
of soul starvation  which are worse than those of the body  when you
marry a woman you isolate her from the love making of other men  and so
you are in honor bound to provide her with an ample supply of soft talk
yourself 

 therefore  make it a rule of your life to give your wife at least one
kiss every day that has in it some thrill of love and passion  and
that isn t flavored with ham and eggs like the perfunctory peck on the
cheek or the back of the ear which is all most men hand their wives in
the osculation line  and  for heaven s sake  don t neglect to pay your
wife compliments  when she has on a new dress tell her how pretty she
looks and how becoming it is  instead of grunting or demanding to know
how much it costs  if you have eyes enough to see other women s pretty
clothes and intelligence enough to say the right things about them  why
not about your wife s  when it will please her to death and make her
think what a wonderful man she has married 

 the next point in being a good husband consists in doing something
actively to make your wife happy and showing a human interest in her 
many men think they have done their whole duty as husbands when they
furnish their wives with food and shelter and plenty of money  i have
heard men excuse themselves for never remembering an anniversary or
giving their wives a little present by saying that they didn t know
what mary or sally wanted  and that they had charge accounts at the
best jewelers and department stores and could buy themselves whatever
they wanted 

 that kind of thing doesn t make a woman happy  there isn t a wife in
the world who wouldn t get more thrill out of a dollar string of blue
beads that her husband bought because they matched her eyes than she
would out of a pearl necklace that she bought herself on her wedding
anniversary because her husband had forgotten they were ever married 
it is the personal touch that counts with women  the sentiment  the
knowledge that her husband is concerned about her  that he notices when
she is tired  that he appreciates all that she does  that he tries to
make her happy and wants to give her every pleasure that he can 

 if you want to be a good husband  son  remember to do the little
things  and the big things will do themselves  be affectionate  be
kind  be appreciative  jolly her instead of finding fault with her  be
liberal in the use of flattery and take her to some place of amusement
at least once a week  and she will thank god on her knees for having
given you to her for a husband

giving children advantages


among my acquaintances is a woman who is always bemoaning the fact that
she cannot give her children  advantages   she sheds barrels of tears
over their not having the  advantages  that the children of the rich
have  she beats upon her breast and laments that she cannot send her
boys to college  and give them high powered motorcars  and when she
thinks of not being able to dress her daughters like fashion plates
and send them off to summer and winter resorts  she melts down into a
perfect pulp of self pity  after listening to this wail for a number of
years  i grew exasperated  and said to her 

 what are the advantages that you cannot give your children  let us
sit down and consider them dispassionately  and see if your children
really are so unfortunate  and so handicapped in life as you think
they are  let us begin with your not being able to send your boys off
to college  i grant you that we would all like to give our children
every possible opportunity to acquire a good education  but not all
knowledge comes put up in school book packages  furthermore  the
degree a man takes who graduates from the university of hard knocks
has a lot of practical  available information  and a working knowledge
of life that is worth a bushel of m a  s and ph d  s  and that it will
take the college graduate ten or fifteen years to acquire  many of the
best informed  best read men that i know never saw the inside of a
college  in these days of cheap books  and magazines  and newspapers 
if a man wants an education he will get it 

 nor is the lack of a college education any bar to success  the men
who are running things in america to day spent their formative years 
from    to     in learning about mines  and railroads  and stores  and
banking  instead of being grounded in greek and latin  and they are
hiring college graduates to work for them  moreover  while you can lead
a boy to the pierian spring  you cannot make him drink from it  and you
know well enough that the great majority of boys who are sent off to
college idle away their time  and come back with nothing but a college
yell  the latest thing in klassy kut kollege klothes  and a maddening
air of superiority  so comfort yourself with the knowledge that if your
son has it in him to take an education he will get it  if he yearns for
culture he will acquire it  but if he is just a boy who has good hard
horse sense  and is not intellectual  the sooner he gets to work after
his high school days the better for him  of course  mother like  you
want your children to have everything that multimillionaires have  but
in your heart you must know that money is a curse to a boy instead of
a blessing  to begin with  wealth paralyzes ambition  we are all poor 
weak creatures who take the line of least resistance  and when we don t
have to do things we become slackers  we have to have necessity to spur
us on to achievement 

 call over the roll of the rich men of to day  of the men who sit
in high places  from the president down  of the men who are famous
inventors  and writers  and artists  they were almost all poor boys 
there is scarcely the name of a millionaire s son in the whole list 
and riches lead a boy into temptation from which the poor boy is safe 
the boy who has to work for his daily bread has his mind and his
hands occupied  he has something interesting and exciting always to
do  the idle rich boy must make his own diversions  and find some way
of killing time  and he does it only too often by the booze and the
gambling route  and in the company of wild women  for adventuresses
and grafters fasten themselves like leeches on the man with a fat
pocketbook  there is nothing like lacking the price as a first aid to
virtue 

 as for not being able to give your girls advantages  do you really
think it is any advantage to a girl to be brought up to be nothing but
a fashion plate  to have no duties and responsibilities  to have no
object in life except amusing herself and to be taught merely to be
a waster and a spender  do you think that the woman who has a dozen
homes in this country and europe  between which she vibrates with no
more local attachments than a transient guest has in a hotel  gets the
pleasure out of them that the woman does out of her little bungalow 
whose every plank has been paid for by some sacrifice and where every
chair and plate is the result of weeks of saving and planning  do you
think the girl who buys herself a european title is as happy with the
 rou   husband she has purchased as the girl who marries some clean 
honest young chap she loves and works up with him to prosperity  do you
think that the woman who bears children and then turns them over to
nurses and governesses gets the benediction out of motherhood that the
woman does who cradles her children on her breast and rears them up at
her knee 

 you lament that you cannot give your daughters the chance to make fine
marriages  why  the working girl has ten times as good chance to make a
good marriage as the society girl has  because she is thrown with more
men  she works side by side with the go getters and the coming men 
and she has the pick of them all  so   i said to my lachrymose friend 
 stop whining because you aren t rich and can t give your children
 advantages   you are giving them the necessity of standing on their
own feet and fighting their own battles  of developing all that is best
in them  and that is the greatest advantage that you could possibly
give them

sell yourself to your children


did you ever contemplate trying to  sell  your children  as the
advertising experts say  the things you wish them to be and do  did you
ever try selling them yourself  of course  the old idea is that the
proper way to rear children is by forcing on them a system of do s and
don ts  we tell our children that they must do this  and they mustn t
do that  we try to coerce them along the straight and narrow road
because that is the proper path for them to travel  but we never take
the trouble to artfully entice them into it and make them think that
they have chosen it of their own free wills 

we want our children to love us  to admire us  to consider us their
best friends  but we expect them to do this because we believe it the
duty of children to honor their parents  not ten fathers and mothers
in a thousand ever deliberately try to make themselves attractive to
their children or win their confidence  perhaps this is why there are
so many boys and girls hurtling down the broad highway to destruction 
why parental influence amounts to so little  and why the average child
feels that it has less in common with its own father and mother than it
has with any other man and woman it knows 

we have just begun to realize that propaganda is one of the greatest
and most insidious forces on earth  we have seen it lift men up to the
skies and make gods of them  then turn and pull them down  and trample
them into the dust  we have seen it exalt a nation into sainthood
and turn it into a howling mob  crying for blood  and if it can thus
sway and move grown up people  what a weapon it is to use upon the
plastic mind of a child  this being the case  why should we not  sell 
our children the ideals we wish them to have  why should we not feed
them on the right propaganda from their cradle up  why should we not
advertise the good things of life until we make them so alluring that
the child will want them 

why should we not sell righteousness to our children  it is one thing
to preach and nag at them about drink  and gambling  and associating
with bad men and women until you bore them to tears and make them
wonder what is the fascination of the evil that they are so warned
against  and it is another thing to make clean living the symbol of
health  and strength  and length of days  the respect of one s fellow
men and  above all  the thing that sets one right with one s own soul 

why not sell our children education  we scourge them to school  which
most of them regard as a place of penance  and where  dull and bored 
they sit in stolid indifference  while the dull and bored teachers
go through the perfunctory routine of hearing them recite lessons in
which they do not pretend to take the slightest interest  but suppose
we could really sell these children the idea of education  suppose
we could get them as interested in history as they are in stories of
adventure  suppose we could make them see that spelling and arithmetic
are not tasks  that they are the tools with which they will work when
they get their first jobs as stenographers and bookkeepers  and that
the better they spell and the quicker they are at figures the bigger
their pay envelopes will be  suppose we could make them see that
knowledge is power  and that whether they stay at the foot of the
ladder or climb to the top is going to depend on how well their brains
are trained  why  if we could make children see the advantages of an
education we would not have to force them to go to school  they would
be eager and anxious to go 

suppose we sold our children good manners  we are always correcting
johnny at the table about the way he eats  and he is so used to our
don ts about walking in front of people and keeping his hat on that
he has long since ceased to listen when we speak  but suppose  from
his earliest infancy  johnny had heard boors ridiculed  and knife
swallowers  and cup cuddlers  and audible soup eaters held up to scorn
as figures of fun  do you not know that johnny would as soon think of
committing murder as one of these offenses  and suppose johnny has had
it impressed on him by precept and example that good manners are a
letter of credit that is honored the world over  that they will take
you farther than anything else on earth  don t you know that johnny
would be incapable of loutishness  because good manners had simply been
bred into him 

why should we not sell our children industry and thrift  propaganda
again  you can make work the most thrilling of all games  you can make
a child feel that his job is of great importance  you can form in
childhood an unbreakable habit of industry  you can teach the child how
to deny itself little things in order to save the money for big things 
you can make it feel the independence of having its own little bank
account  you can set a goal before it and light the fires of ambition
in its soul 

finally  why not sell yourself to your children  why not make as much
effort to ingratiate yourself with your children as you would with
a stranger  why not try to impress your children with your ability 
your wisdom  your up to dateness  as you would any man or woman with
whom you are trying to do business  if parents could only convince
their children that they are not back numbers and incarnate killjoys
it would do more than any other one thing to improve the family
relationship  believe me  it pays to advertise especially with your
children

taking husbands  as is 


i wish that i could make every young girl who gets married a present
of a handsomely framed motto to hang on the wall above the mirror of
her dressing table  where she would be compelled to see it every time
she put on or took off her complexion  or repaired the cupid s bow
of her lips  on this motto in gorgeously illumined letters would be
these sapient words of grover cleveland   it is a condition and not a
theory that confronts you   i can think of no other advice in the world
that would be such a lamp to guide the feet of any young woman who is
starting to blunder down the rough road of matrimony  as this cold 
hard  unimaginative assertion of a simple fact  it brushes away with
one gesture of common sense all the dreams and romances and fairy tales
of courtship  and leaves a woman facing the reality of matrimony  which
is never as she thought it would be  it just is as it is 

if women would only abandon their theories about what matrimony
should be  and how husbands should act  and deal with them as they
are  it would save floods of tears  innumerable broken hearts 
hundreds of cases of nervous prostration  and put the divorce courts
out of business  furthermore  that women are mostly right in their
contentions  and have logic and justice on their side  doesn t alter
this aspect of the situation at all  for instance  woman s perpetual
grievance against her husband is his indifference  she wails out that
he inveigled her into matrimony under false pretenses because from the
ardor with which he wooed her  he led her to believe and expect that
he would be an eternal lover and would spend a large part of his time
telling her how beautiful and wonderful she was  and how he adored
her  instead of making good on this antenuptial propaganda  however 
he stopped all of his love making at the altar with a suddenness that
jarred her wisdom teeth loose  and in place of being a ladylove  she
finds herself merely a household convenience 

millions of women make themselves miserable because their husbands
never make love to them  never pay them a compliment  never give them
any sign of appreciation  never take them to any place of amusement 
never give any indication that they still care for them and want them
to be happy  these suffering sisters could save themselves nearly
all of their woe if they would just throw their rosy dreams of how a
husband should treat a wife into the discard  and accept the truth
that very few men are sentimentalists  most of them feel like fools
when they are love making  and so they get the ordeal over with as
quickly as possible  they consider that when a man marries a woman 
and undertakes her board bill and shopping ticket  that he has given a
proof of devotion strong enough to draw money on at the bank  and there
is no use in saying anything more about it  also they feel that the
fact that they selected the women they did for wives showed that they
admired them above all other women  so why harp on that string  and  of
course  they want their wives to be happy  what else do they toil for
except to doll their wives up  and give them cars and houses and trips
to palm beach 

so the wife may be very happy and contented who has philosophy enough
to take her husband as he is  good  kind and generous  even if he is a
dumb lover  apparently more interested in his business than he is in
her  she realizes that he says it with checks instead of with flowery
phrases  and that if she is starved emotionally she is sure of her
daily roast beef and potatoes  then there is the matter of adjustment
between a man and a woman  every bride dreams an impossible dream of
a husband who is chilled steel to all the balance of the world  but
putty in her hands  experience blows this fair dream to the ends of the
earth  and she finds that she can no more alter her husband s habits
and prejudices than she can the laws of the medes and the persians  he
has his ways  and she can either give in to them or fight over them 
he has his set opinions  and she can sidestep them or fight with him
about them 

she can either use tact and diplomacy in handling him  or else be in a
perpetual quarrel with him  and she protests that this isn t fair or
just  she says that it is as much his place to give in to her as it is
hers to give in to him  that it is just as much his business to deal
subtly with her  as it is her business to deal subtly with him  of
course  the woman is right  but being right doesn t help her a bit in
getting along with her husband  it is a condition and not a theory that
confronts her  if any harmonious relations exist between her and her
husband  she has to furnish the harmony  if there is any adapting  it
is the wife who must do the adapting 

women likewise complain that it is unjust that they should have to do
practically all of the work of making a happy home  they say that it
is just as much a man s business to be a little ray of sunshine in
the home as it is a woman s  that it is just as much up to a husband
to wear the smile that won t come off as it is the wife s  they say
that there is no more reason why they should read up on subjects that
interest their husbands  so as to be able to hand out a good line of
conversation  than why their husbands shouldn t read up on fashion
journals so as to be able to discuss intelligently with them the length
of skirts and the latest hair bob  true  but again it is the condition
and not the theory of matrimony that confronts them  and unless the
wife makes the happy home it isn t made  it is when women forget what
matrimony should be  and deal with it as it is  that they make a
success of it

being a good wife


 i want to be a good wife  the kind of a wife like that lady in the
bible whose price was above rubies   said a little bride to me the
other day   what shall i do to be a real helpmeet to my husband  

 well  my dear   i replied   there are three general counts on which
every wife must make good in order to help her husband  and then
the job becomes the work of an expert  and varies according to the
temperament of the man  to begin with  every woman who is an asset
instead of a total loss to her husband  must make him a comfortable
home and feed him properly  when a man marries  he practically turns
over his stomach and his nerves and his brains to his wife s care 
and she can keep him at the peak of efficiency by giving him a quiet 
restful place to come to at night  and a good dinner to eat  or she can
sabotage the whole works by throwing in quarrels and heavy biscuit and
tough meat 

 there is practically no limit to the amount of work a man can do
whose wife takes care of him  and who has a happy home life  the men
who break down with nervous prostration are the men who  after the
struggle and anxiety and worries of a business day  go home to strife
and wrangles and recriminations and nagging and to food that would
kill an ostrich  no nerves and no digestion will stand it  a breakfast
of flabby cakes and muddy coffee  that make him take a dyspeptic and
despairing view of things  and see the world through blue spectacles 
has made many a man turn down a good proposition that would have
carried him on to fame and fortune  a spat with his wife that left his
nerves on edge  and his soul filled with bitterness  has made many a
man quarrel with his partner and insult his best client or customer 

 so  my dear  if you want to help your husband succeed  you must begin
by making him a home wherein his tired body and frazzled nerves may
refresh themselves  so that he may go forth with new strength to battle
with the world  you must make him happy  for there is nothing that
happy people may not achieve  the next item is to keep on cutting bait 
don t deceive yourself into thinking that because you have captured
your man he will stay captive  it is a job that has to be done over
again every morning 

 you know the arts and wiles with which you lured him into matrimony 
you recall the pretty dresses you wore  the glad  sweet smile with
which you met him  the pleasure you showed you took in his society  a
man doesn t put on blinders when he gets married  he still has an eye
out for a pretty woman in a gay frock  and he likes to feel that his
wife still cares enough for him to want to make herself attractive to
him and that his coming home is the big event of the day to her 

 item three in being a good wife is to be a loving wife  women are
always talking about being heart hungry and seem to think that it is an
exclusively feminine complaint  but there are just as many men starving
for affection as there are women  don t expect your husband to take
it for granted that you still love him because you haven t applied
for a divorce  tell him so  give him a kiss now and then that isn t
just a peck on the cheek  but love with discretion  don t smother your
husband with affection  don t surfeit him on it  keep your love as a
sweetener for matrimony  don t make it the whole diet  remember that
the most loved husband in the world said   feed me with apples  stay me
with flagons  for i am sick of love  

 the fourth item in being a good wife is not to expect the impossible
of your husband  don t demand that he be a demigod  accept him as a
poor  faulty human being  even as you are  don t have hysterics every
time he topples off of the pedestal on which you have placed him  help
him up  dust him off and give him a seat beside you  humor him in his
funny little ways  sidestep his little prejudices  don t argue with
him when your opinions clash  laugh at his blunders and sympathize with
him when he makes mistakes  and he will make you his confidant and tell
you the truth  which is the finest tribute that any man ever pays his
wife 

 item five in being a good wife is to be appreciative  when the average
man gets married he sells himself into bondage to his family  the
remainder of his life he spends toiling to keep his wife and children
soft and safe  and whether all this work and sacrifice is worth the
price and is a glorious reward depends altogether on his wife s
attitude  if she takes it as nothing but her due  it is slavery  but if
she lets him see every day in every way that she thinks that he is the
finest and noblest man that ever lived  and that no be medaled warrior
has anything on him in heroism  it makes it all worth while and causes
him to feel that being a husband and father is the finest career on
earth 

 item six in being a good wife is to keep yourself good natured  tho
you have all other virtues  yet are a high tempered virago or a nagger 
you will be a failure as a wife and your husband will curse the day he
married you 

 item seven is to be a good sport  to take the bad with the good of
matrimony without whining  not to welch on your part of the work and
sacrifices  to be willing to go where your husband s fortunes call
him  to fight the battle with him shoulder to shoulder and never to
give up the ship 

 the next way to help your husband is by keeping yourself cheerful and
optimistic  nothing breaks down a man s morale so quickly as having a
wife who is whining and complaining  who reproaches him with not making
as much money as other men do  and who lets him see that she does not
believe in him  now we can only do the things we think we can do  and
when we kill a man s faith in himself we have slain his ability to
succeed  ninety nine husbands out of a hundred live up to their wives 
expectations of them  if their wives are always knocking them and
discouraging them and wet blanketing their every plan and prophesying
failure  they fail  but if their wives are cheerful and optimistic  if
they encourage them  if they believe in them  and make them believe in
themselves  they succeed  they simply have to make good because their
wives expect it  most wives write their husbands  price tags  price
yours high  and your husband will deliver the goods 

 the next point in being a good wife is for the wife deliberately
to make herself her husband s best friend  that means that you must
interest yourself in whatever interests him  first and foremost  you
must take an interest in his business  practically all men like to talk
shop  but they can t do it to women who yawn in their faces and who
never take the trouble to learn the technique of the business out of
which they get their living  a woman can help her husband not only by
taking an interest in his business  but by making friends for him  many
a man is advertised into success by his charming wife  and many a man
is bankrupted by his disagreeable and ill mannered spouse  a woman can
help her husband by using a little common sense in her attitude toward
his business  and by being willing to make the sacrifices necessary to
his success 

 the woman who always speaks of her husband s office as  that old
office   and who resents his interest in his business and the time he
devotes to it  the woman who will not let her husband leave a poor job
with no future to it  to take a better one in which he could make his
fortune  because it would take her away from mother and the girls and
main street  the doctors  and dentists  wives who are jealous of their
husbands  patients  and the lawyer s wife who blabs  are all first aids
to their husbands  failure  only a man of superhuman talent can succeed
against the handicap of such a wife 

 then come the two specific ways in which a wife can help her husband 
and which depend on the individual man  some men have talent  but lack
backbone  they are brilliant but weak  they get easily discouraged and
need to be bucked up and flattered and admired continually  they are
prone to give up  and they need a wife who will hold them to their
purpose when they falter and waver  a wife can help this type of man
best by being a little hard and very ambitious  by bracing him up with
her own strength and literally pushing him on to success  the clinging
vine  helpless sort of women bring out the best that is in other men 
if their wives could stand on their own feet  their husbands would let
them do it  but because their wives can do nothing but hang around
their necks  they feel that they must fight to the death for them 

 this is the reason that for the wife to be thrifty and saving is not
always the best way to help a man  because many a man has had to hustle
to meet the demands of an extravagant wife he has made the effort that
turned him into a millionaire 

 but mostly  my dear  if you want to help your husband  just love him
enough  perhaps that is the best way of all

invalidism a graft


do you ever think that it is dishonest to be sick when you might be
well  it is just plain stealing  and it is the most despicable form
of petty larceny  because it is robbing those who love you  and trust
you and who are defenseless against you  they cannot lock up their
sympathies  their peace of mind  their personal service  their money 
safely away from your pilfering  of course  there are many people who
are really ill  through no fault of their own  they are smitten by some
terrible disease  and they deserve all that we can give of pity and
help as they go stumbling down the agonized way to the grave 

these words are not for them  but for that multitude of men and women
with whom sickness is merely a graft  a camouflage for selfishness  and
a blanket excuse with which they cover up all their sins of omission
and commission  and that furnishes them a perfect alibi for doing
everything they want to do  and leaving undone those things which they
do not wish to do 

ninety per cent of all the sickness in the world is voluntary  or at
least comes through contributory negligence  people are sick because
they are not willing to make the sacrifices to keep well 

and curiously enough they justify themselves by claiming that their
own health is a personal matter   if i make myself sick  i am the one
who has to suffer   they say  if this were true  far be it from the
rest of us to interfere with their pleasures  but it isn t true  no
man or woman is sick to himself or herself alone  we have to listen to
their groans  we have to minister to them  we have to do their work 
we have to pay their doctor s bills  we have to put up with their
irritability and unreason because sickness is supposed to give people
 carte blanche  to do and say all the things that well people do not
dare to do  when ill health is an act of god  as shipping manifests
say  and therefore beyond our control  it is one thing  when it is the
result of weak self indulgence it is another thing  our sympathies and
our assistance go out to the victim of tuberculosis or cancer  but we
have nothing but contempt for the glutton who keeps himself sick from
overeating 

in every business house where women are employed there is such a large
percentage of them absent from work on account of sickness  especially
during the winter  that the question is often raised whether the
delicate feminine constitution can stand the strain of commercial life 
stuff and nonsense  it isn t the work that is hurting the girls  it is
the way they dress and live 

they feel that they have a perfect right to risk bad colds and
pneumonia by coming to work on rainy  sloppy  sleety days in
paper soled satin pumps and chiffon stockings  and with not enough
clothes on to keep an icicle warm  they consider it their own affair
if they prefer to spend their money on an imported hat instead of on
nourishing food  they think if they come to the office with a nervous
headache that makes them blind and stupid with pain  and was brought on
by too many nights of successive jazzing  it is a matter between them
and the aspirin bottle alone  but it isn t  they are not giving their
employers a square deal  they are not giving them the services they
pay for  they are upsetting the routine of the office  and laying the
burden of their work on the shoulders of other people 

look at the invalid wives you know  dozens of them who have brought
nervous prostration on themselves by overwork  or too many clubs and
causes  or too much society  don t we all know women who go on orgies
of housecleaning  or dressmaking  though they know perfectly well that
every such debauch is going to end up in a spell of sickness which
will call for doctors and trained nurses  don t we know women who wear
themselves to tatters over church fairs and club campaigns  don t we
know women who play bridge every day until they are so nervous that
they become unbearable at home and their husbands have to send them off
to sanatoriums to get a little peace and rest themselves  we do 

we marvel that these women never stop to consider how they are
defrauding their families  they never consider what a wickedly
dishonest thing it is to deprive a husband and children of a healthy 
strong wife and mother  and give them a neurotic  irritable  cross 
nerve wrecked creature who makes the home about as cheerful as a
grave yard  and in which they have always to walk softly and speak in
whispers for fear of disturbing the lady who has just gone to bed with
a neuralgia headache 

then there is the large army of women who enjoy poor health  who are
professional invalids for the simple reason that they are too lazy and
indolent to make the effort to be well  they are quitters who literally
take life lying down  they cultivate small ailments  they acquire the
sanatorium habit  and they expect to be pitied and babied instead of
being ostracized as dishonest grafters who snatch the very bread out of
the mouths of their families to pay their unnecessary doctor s bills 
we all know dozens of these women who suffer from imaginary complaints 
and we have seen many of them cured by their husband s death  when they
had to quit being sick  and go to work and support themselves 

that is why i say that it is dishonest to be sick when you might be
well

selfishness made to order


 my daughter is so selfish toward me   wailed a mother to me the other
day   she never considers my comfort or happiness in any way whatever 
since the day she was born i have never had a thought except for her 
i have given her the best of everything  i have worn old clothes in
order that she might have fine new ones  i have done without the things
i wanted that she might indulge her every desire  i have gone to the
places that she wished to go to  instead of the places where i wished
to go  i have cooked and sewed and waited upon her like a slave  but
instead of appreciating all that i have done for her she takes it as
a matter of course  she thinks any old cast off is good enough for
mother and never dreams of doing anything she doesn t want to do for my
pleasure  and that is my reward for all the sacrifices i have made for
her  

 say rather that  as the result of all the sacrifices that you have
made for your daughter   i replied   your girl is just exactly what
you have made her  you have put in twenty two years of conscientious
work in erecting a monument of selfishness  and you have no right to
complain  you wouldn t build a house of mud and garbage cans and expect
it to be a white marble palace  how  then  can you expect to build up a
child s character with all the meanest characteristics of human nature
and expect it to be fine and noble  impossible  and that is the sort of
miracle that you parents expect from your children when you demand that
they shall be something totally different from the thing into which you
have made them 

 when your daughter was born  she was as plastic as clay in your hands 
it was your privilege to mold her into any shape you pleased  you
could have taught her to be unselfish  to be considerate  to think of
other people  to love and honor and respect you  instead of that  from
her first conscious moment  you taught her to despise you  to think
you of no account and not worth considering  you taught her to think
only of herself  of her own pleasures and desires  and to get what she
wanted at any cost to others  now you whine because your teaching has
borne fruit  you are unjust and unreasonable  what we sow  we reap
inevitably  if you make yourself a doormat before your children  they
will walk over you and kick you about  because they naturally think
that you know where you belong in the household and have taken your
proper place 

 they would just as naturally have looked up to you if you had placed
yourself on a pedestal above them and demanded to be worshiped 
children don t reason about their parents  they just accept them as
they are and hold them cheap  or dear  according to the way the mother
and father value themselves  i have no tears to shed over the sorrows
of mothers who have selfish and ungrateful daughters  because every
time it is the mother s own fault  she is to blame  not the girl 

 if she had spent part of the clothes money on getting herself some
pretty frocks  instead of lavishing it all on daughter  daughter would
be proud of mother instead of being ashamed of her  if she had made
daughter help with the housework and the sewing  instead of slaving
over the cookstove and the sewing machine so that daughter might go
free  daughter would think about saving mother and doing things for
her  if she had asserted her rights to her own personal tastes and
pleasures  instead of letting daughter s tastes and pleasures rule the
household  daughter would show her some consideration and remember
mother s likes and dislikes  and cater to them  there are mothers who
are queens in their families  just as there are mothers who are nothing
but the maid of all work in their homes  and it rests with every mother
to decide which she will be  it is the queen mothers who are loved and
appreciated  and who have dutiful  unselfish children  the drudge
mother gets only the wages of the drudge from her children 

 in reality  the mother who rears her children up to be monsters of
selfishness has no right to expect appreciation and gratitude from
them because she has done them as ill a turn as one human being can do
another  she has warped their characters  she has developed in them
traits that mar their happiness and are a handicap to success  she has
made them egotists  and they are never satisfied and continually at
variance with those about them  in particular is selfishness a blight
upon a woman s life  for the selfish woman finds it almost impossible
to make the sacrifices that wifehood and motherhood demand of her  one
of the main reasons why divorce is so prevalent is because when so many
selfish girls find that they can t treat their husbands as they did
their mothers  they throw up their hands and quit 

 and so   i said to the mother of the selfish daughter   you are unfair
to your daughter  don t blame her for being what you made her  what
else could you expect

self control


if i were to go to a mother who was cradling her babe on her breast 
and tell her that i knew a magic formula by which she could insure
power  and prosperity  and happiness to her child  she would impoverish
herself to purchase this knowledge from me  and fall on her knees and
bless me for having given it to her 

yet i know just such a bit of white magic  in her secret soul every
mother herself knows it  but ninety nine times out of a hundred she is
either too weak or too lazy to use it 

this charm that would have changed all life for innumerable people 
that would have kept men out of prisons  and women out of brothels 
that would have turned paupers into rich men  made the unsuccessful
successful and stopped the wheels of the divorce court consists simply
in teaching children self control 

almost every misfortune under which humanity suffers goes straight back
to that  there is hardly a derelict in the world who cannot say   i
would not be what i am if my mother had taught me to control myself  

for it is lack of self control that is at the bottom of most of our
sins of omission and commission 

look at the murderer going to the death chair  not once in a thousand
times is he a cold blooded murderer  but he was a high tempered child
whose mother never taught him to control himself  there came a day when
something irritated him more than usual and  aflame with anger  he took
a fellow creature s life  it is the supreme manifestation of the same
spirit that made him kick the chair against which he stumbled as a
child and beat with impotent little fists all who thwarted him 

look at the drunkard wallowing in the gutter  he is there because his
mother never taught him to control his appetites  he is the logical
outgrowth of the greedy little boy who was permitted to gorge himself
on cake and candy until it made him ill 

look at the poor  shabby  out at elbows man who has drifted from job to
job all his life  and has never been able to make a decent support for
himself and his family  he is his mother s handiwork  she put the curse
of incompetence on him when she let him give up every undertaking the
moment he struck the hard sledding in it 

he changed from one school to another because the lessons were too
difficult  or the teacher was too strict  when he started to work  he
left one place because the hours were too long  another because his
boss was too exacting  he tried a dozen different occupations that he
left because he found they had unpleasant features and involved doing
uncongenial tasks  he is a down and outer because his mother never
taught him the self control that makes a man set his teeth and go
through with the business to which he has put his hand 

look at the girls who go astray  not one of  the sorrowful sisterhood 
as the japanese pitifully call them  but who is what she is because her
mother did not teach her self control  did the girl sin because she was
so weak and so in love with some vicious libertine that she listened
to her heart instead of her head  her mother could have saved her from
a fate worse than death if she had taught her to control her emotions 
instead of being ruled by them 

did the girl sell her soul for fine clothes  and good times  again
the mother s fault for not teaching the girl self control  and to do
without the things that she could not honestly get 

look at the poor old people who are dependent on their children  or
the grudging charity of relatives and friends  in how many cases is
their unhappy fate simply the result of their lack of self control 
they have had their chance of fortune  as long as the man was able to
work he made plenty of money  and they lived luxuriously  but they
spent everything as they went along  they laid up nothing for their
rainy day  and when it came  it found them paupers and parasites  the
difference between dependence and independence  between comfort and
misery in your old age depends upon how much self control you have had
in your youth 

look at the ever increasing number of divorces  look at the forlorn
half orphan children  and broken up homes  look at the unhappy married
couples you know  what is the real cause of all this domestic trouble 
merely that mothers do not teach their children self control  they
raise up spoiled  selfish daughters who never consider a thing in life
but their own pleasure 

they raised up spoiled  selfish sons who have never considered another
human being but themselves  these two  with undisciplined wills 
unrestrained tempers  undirected impulses  marry each other  and they
fight like cats and dogs  observation shows that either a husband or
a wife who controls himself or herself can save almost any marriage 
and it takes no prophet to foretell that mothers could insure their
children s domestic happiness by teaching them iron bound self control 

you can teach a baby three weeks old self control by refusing to give
it the thing it howls for  say to the toddler that falls and bumps its
nose   mother s brave boy doesn t cry   and it will bite back the sobs 
it will yell the roof off if you pity it  a child of three will be
obedient  cheerful  respectful of the rights of others  or he will be
a little demon  according to the way his mother has brought him up 

if she has taught him self control  she has given him the magic that
works all the miracles of life  and if she hasn t  she has done him the
greatest wrong that any human being can possibly do to another human
being

young  i ve got the best daddy in the world  and i love him with all
my heart  but he is ruining my life trying to make me the sort of girl
that he says mother was  and i m not mother  i am myself  and i don t
live thirty years ago  i live now  and i have to be a model girl of
now or else a back number at whom nobody will look and whom nobody
wants  father says he is an old fashioned father  and he is trying
to make me an old fashioned girl  i never have any up to the minute
clothes because mother didn t wear short skirts and no corsets and bob
her hair  i can t go joy riding with a crowd because they didn t have
automobiles when father was young  i have to be home at    o clock when
i go out in the evening because he says that he never stayed out late
when he was young 

 i can t dance because father didn t jazz and he doesn t think the
modern dances respectable  he won t let me read any of the six best
sellers because he doesn t approve of modern literature  and he makes
me read old fashioned books that i almost yawn my head off over  and
he just simply loathes all the boys who come to see me  calls them
sapheads  and he wonders why i want to waste my time talking nonsense
with little jellybeans such as they are  he says it is just appalling
to see how youth has deteriorated since his day  and that when he was
young the boys and girls were all serious minded young people  who
cared only for rational amusements  and that instead of chasing around
to cabarets they spent the evening at home in intelligent conversation 

 i suppose we young ones are a poor lot compared to what our parents
were  but such as we are  we are  in rome you have to do as the romans
do or else you get left  i want to play with the other girls and boys 
but i can t unless i play the way they do  my father is always talking
about home being woman s proper sphere  and wifehood and motherhood
being a woman s noblest career  but how am i to get married if i am
never permitted to have any dates with boys  you might just as well
lock a girl up in a stone cell and throw away the key as not to let her
do what the other girls are doing  there are too many pretty girls 
with lots of fun and pep in them  that the boys can run around with 
for them to take the trouble to hunt up one that is laid up on the
shelf and labeled  old fashioned   and when i tell my father this he
gets angry and i cry  and i don t know what to do because i don t want
to disobey him and i don t want to waste my youth sticking around at
home and having no pleasure  

 alas  my dear   i said   your father is trying to foist his ideals
on you  just as his father tried to foist his ideals on him  each
generation tries to do it and each makes dark prophecies about what
the present generation is coming to  your grandfather thought bustles
just as dreadful as your father thinks rolled stockings are  your
grandfather disapproved of side bar buggies just as much as your father
does of automobiles  your grandfather considered the waltz just as
indecent as your father does shimmying  your grandfather thought your
father should only read shakespeare and richardson  and considered
dickens frivolous  just as your father thinks you ought to read dickens
instead of  the sheik   and your grandfather told your father how
superior the young men of his day were  and how they spent their time
in improving their minds and always went to bed with the chickens  and
how they doted on intellectual conversation  just as his father told
him and great great great great grandfather told his son 

 and it is all stuff and nonsense  not a word of it has ever been true 
each succeeding generation of young people have been pleasure loving
and laughter loving and foolish  and have danced and played and
skylarked  and all the difference is that their games have taken on
different phases in different ages  it is a pity that fathers and
mothers cannot remember this  if they did and would look on with
sympathy and understanding  they could keep close enough to their
children to know what they are doing and to stretch out a hand and hold
them steady when they start to go wild  and to snatch them back when
they get too near to the edge of the pit  for youth will be served 
youth must have its fling  high spirits must find a vent  suppress
these with the heavy hand of authority and something blows up 

 lock a girl in her room  and she will climb out of the window  forbid
her to see boys at home  and she will meet them on the street  refuse
to let her go to nice dances  and she will slip away to low dance
halls  the wildest and most reckless girls are invariably those with
the strictest parents  the young people of to day live in the world of
to day and must do as they do to day  parents must recognize that and
deal with them on that platform if they wish to do their duty by their
children

losing a wife s love


one of the most curious superstitions in the world is the childlike
belief that men have in the indestructibility of women s love 
they visualize the feminine heart as a sort of perpetual motion
machine that  once they press the button and set it to work  goes on
automatically pumping up affection for them as long as they live 
and they think that nothing they do or say ever interferes with its
functioning  in a word  they believe that if a man wins a woman s love
it is his for keeps  he can t lose it or mislay it  the poor thing
has no choice but to go on adoring him to the end  because she is
built that way  it is a comfortable and consoling theory  and men take
liberties with it  but the trouble is that it isn t true  in reality 
women are just as fickle as men are  and just as few women as men
are capable of a deep and abiding love  women s fancies are just as
unstable as men s  they are just as much lured by a handsome face and
fall as easily for a smooth line of soft talk  and there are just as
many wives who get tired of their husbands as there are husbands who
are weary of their wives 

the only difference between the sexes in the matter is that women face
the situation  while men shut their eyes to it and refuse to recognize
that it exists  every woman knows that because a man was in love with
her when he married her is no indication that he is going to remain in
love with her to the end of the chapter  she knows that if she keeps
her husband s affection she has to be up and doing  and on the job 
that is why there are millions of women undergoing all the agonies of
slow starvation trying to maintain a girlish figure  why millions are
boiled alive and thumped and scalped in beauty parlors  and why the
nation spends more a year for face paint than it does for house paint 
and why  wherever we go  we see fat  middle aged  bread and butter
wives attempting to look like flappers and acquire the technique of the
vamp in order to keep their husbands nailed to their own firesides 

apparently  however  it never occurs to a man that there is the
slightest necessity to make any effort to keep his wife fascinated and
to prevent her eyes from roaming around in search of a sheik  he may
be bay windowed and bald  but if he reduces it is only on his doctor s
orders  and not because he wants to look boyish to his wife  and he
never buys a toupee until after he becomes a widower and begins to take
notice again  the idea that his wife might cease to love him actually
never crosses the average man s mind  he is convinced that she couldn t
do it  it is some peculiarity of the feminine constitution that makes
a woman go on loving what has become unlovable  now  with a man it is
different  of course  he realizes that he couldn t stay very long in
love with a woman who was slouchy  and sloppy  and untidy looking  who
came to breakfast in a dirty kimono and run down at the heel slippers 
nor would he take much interest in kissing a cheek smeared with cold
cream 

but he doesn t see why his wife shouldn t still regard him as a
romantic figure when he goes around in a soiled shirt and a rumpled
collar  with grease spots on his coat and trousers that bag at the
knees  and offers to her lips a countenance with a two days  stubble of
beard on it 

a man knows well enough that  as far as he is concerned  the only way
to keep the love fires burning is to keep piling the fuel on it and
pouring over it the oil of flattery and praise  but he thinks that
you don t have to put any more fuel on the fire of a woman s heart 
because it is a flame that miraculously replenishes itself  so after he
marries he never bothers to show her any attention  or to pay her any
compliments  or to tell her that he loves her  or give any indication
that he regards her as anything but a piece of useful household
furniture  if any woman ever treated him that way his affection
would mighty soon starve to death  but he never has the slightest
apprehension that his wife s love will perish on the same meager
rations 

there are men who abuse their wives  who swear at them  and curse them 
and speak to them as if they were dogs  there are men whose wives live
in trembling fear of their tempers  there are men who are stingy and
who do not give to their wives  who spend their lives slaving for them 
the poorest wage of an ill paid servant  yet these men go on believing
that their wives still love them because they loved them in the days of
courtship  when they were handsome  gallant  and neat  and attractive 
and loving  and flattering  and generous  and considerate swains 

such men befool themselves by thinking that they cannot kill a woman s
love  never was there a greater mistake  a woman s love is as delicate
and as fragile a thing as a flower that you can crush with a finger 
and it takes never ending skill  and care  and cherishing to keep it
alive  you can kill it with disgust  you can kill it with unkindness 
you can kill it with injustice  you can kill it with neglect  and it
would surprise many a man who still believes that his wife loves him in
spite of the way he has treated her  in spite of his indifference to
her  to know that her love for him has been dead so long that she has
almost forgotten that she ever cared for him at all 

so i warn you  mr  man  not to put any faith in the theory that you
can t kill a woman s love  women are like men  they only love the
lovable  and if you wish to retain your wife s affections  you have got
to continue after marriage the same tactics you used in winning her

the lure of the married man


a man wants to know why married men have such a fascination for girls 
and wherein a benedict s wooing differs from that of a bachelor  the
first part of this double barreled question was answered by eve in the
garden of eden  and every girl takes after her greatest grandmother 
married men are forbidden fruit  and that alone whets the appetite of
the foolish little evelyns for them  and makes them seem the prize
pippins of the whole matrimonial orchard  the thing that a woman cannot
have  that she has no right to have  and especially the thing that some
other woman possesses  is always the thing that she wants most  if
you have ever watched women fight over a commonplace and unattractive
article on a bargain table  where each was determined to have it just
because the others desired it  you have the psychological explanation
of why a girl falls for a married man that she wouldn t look at if he
were single 

also  women are the adventurous sex  they love to play with danger as a
child plays with fire  and a large part of the lure of the married man
consists in the fact that a girl knows that when she has an affair with
one  she is risking every shred of her reputation  and gambling with
her happiness  and that any minute she may be cited as a corespondent 
and dragged into the slime of the divorce courts 

also  the average girl is simply slopping over with romance  and
somehow she gets more kick out of being wooed under the rose than she
does in an above board  honest to god courtship  there is something
about the secrecy of a love intrigue with a married man  about the
surreptitious letters  about the stolen rendezvous  that thrills her to
the core of her being  it makes her feel so desperately wicked  like
one of the grand passion heroines of her favorite novels  who cried
 all for love  and the world well lost  as she chucked her bonnet over
the windmill 

it is because the married man is the only man in the world who is out
of her reach  and whom she has no right to try to grab  it is because
some other woman has set her seal of approval on him by marrying him 
it is because an illicit love episode is a streak of lurid romance in
her drab days  that the little totties and flossies are able to see
the hero of their girlish dreams in the fat  bald headed  middle aged
men for whom they work  and the mauds and gwendolyns imagine that they
have found their affinities in some ordinary commonplace married man 
who would bore them to tears if his wedding ring had not given him a
fictitious value in their eyes 

add to this  vanity and cruelty  in the man hunt  women look on the
married man as big game  and when they bring one down they feel as if
they had captured an elephant instead of having shot a tame rabbit 
there are girls who boast of their conquests among married men  and
who have so little heart that they delight in watching the agonies of
jealousy that they inflict on the poor defenseless wife  many young
women are likewise gold diggers  and these virtually confine their
attentions to married men  as wealthy bachelors are few and well to do
middle aged married men are plentiful and easy 

why the married man who starts out as a lothario is an easy winner
of feminine hearts is perfectly obvious  to begin with  he has the
same advantage that the widower has over the single man  he is a
professional  so to speak  instead of an amateur lover  he has the
education in women that only marriage can give a man  for he has had a
wife and  like the wise man of kipling s poem  he  learned about women
from her   he has found out that all women are so hungry for love that
they will swallow any soft talk without examining its quality  he has
found out that you can jolly a woman into anything  he has found out
that women melt down into a mush that you can do with as you will 
under a little understanding and sympathy  he has found out that if you
remember an anniversary  and a woman s taste in two or three things 
she will believe it an absolute proof of undying devotion 

the married man knows that there is one sure short cut to virtually
every woman s heart  it is pity  and so he begins his love making by
telling the girl that his wife does not understand him  that she is
not his real soul mate  that they have nothing in common  and that his
home is bleak  and barren  and unhappy  generally he accuses his wife
of being a human iceberg  while he is a perfect geyser of love and
tenderness  and then he moans   oh  why did we not meet in time   and
the poor little idiot of a girl undertakes the consolation r le 

of course  all of this effective love play is more or less impossible
to the bachelor  he lacks the technique of the married man  he cannot
appeal to a woman s sympathies  or pose before her in the r le of a
martyr  he can only make love in the commonplace old way  and it cramps
his style  but the real reason that the married man is a devil among
women is just the same old reason that made eve listen to the serpent

forget it


every day some girl writes me that she is young  quite as pretty as the
other girls about her  that she dresses as well  and makes as good an
appearance as they do  and strives to please  but that no man ever pays
her the slightest attention  or asks her to step out with him of an
evening  then this girl goes on to say that she is a business girl  but
she doesn t make a very good salary  and she is discouraged  and blue 
and wants to know what to do 

my advice to a girl in this situation and there are millions of her is
to forget men  give up the struggle to attract them  quit trying to
catch one  renounce romance  throw away all thoughts of marriage  just
accept the fact that nature did not put you in the vamp class  and play
your game of life from that angle 

this counsel will be a bitter pill for the girl to swallow  but she
will find it good medicine that will work a speedy and permanent cure 
if she will try it on herself  why certain women are magnets that draw
every man they meet to them  and why nothing in trousers except upon
compulsion ever goes near other women just as good looking  just as
charming in every way  is one of the mysteries nobody has ever solved 
nor has anyone ever been able to suggest a remedy for this state of
affairs 

the fast steamship  the lightning express  the aeroplane  have
annihilated distance  but human ingenuity has failed to invent any
device to make a boy go to see the girl next door if he doesn t want
to go  science has torn its secrets from the earth  but it cannot find
out what quality it is in woman that attracts men  it has invented
chemicals that work magic in the physical world  but it has never
discovered a reliable love philter 

so that s that  and it is a wise girl who has the courage to look
herself in the face  and see whether she has the  come hither  look in
her eye  and if she hasn t  to recognize the fact  and devote herself
to a more promising occupation than chasing men  who  in the end 
always make their getaway  unless they desire to be caught 

therefore  i would urge the girl who does not make a spontaneous hit
with men  to quit wasting her time and her energies in the vain attempt
to decoy them into noticing her  and to put all that lost motion and
force into her work  where she will get better results 

believe me  if the girl who does not attract men  tried as hard to
sell herself to her job as she does to sell herself socially  she would
not have to complain long of holding a small position  she would be a
highly paid secretary  or buyer  or department manager 

if the girl who does not attract men  studied her employer s moods and
tenses as earnestly as she does those of some little jellybean  and
if she was as anxious to please her employer as she is to please the
jazz hounds and cakeaters she meets  she would find herself one of the
valued employees who are always spoken of reverentially as  our miss
so and so  

if the girl who never has a date would put in one hundredth part of
the intensive study on her work that she gives to the technique of the
popular girl  and to trying to find out something about the psychology
of customers or the history of the goods she handles  or the details of
the business she is employed in  she would have employers fighting over
her 

in a word  if the girl who is not popular with men would concentrate
her thoughts  her interests  and her ambitions  on getting ahead in the
occupation she has chosen  instead of wasting her time and energies in
a fruitless attempt to charm men  she would be a success instead of a
failure  she would be happy instead of miserable 

as it is now she falls between the stools  she is a poor makeshift in
her job  who gets nowhere  because her one desire  her one ambition 
her one aim in life is to attract men and catch a husband  and she is
miserable  and discouraged  and bitter  and disgruntled  because she
is balked in that attempt  and she is a siren without allure who never
arrives at the altar  so she fails both as a business woman  and in her
effort to catch a husband 

this is a great pity  because while love and marriage are highly
desirable blessings to come into a woman s life  they are not the whole
of life  the world is full of such a lot of things besides sentiment 
there is independence  the freedom to come and go as one pleases  there
is the exhilarating sport of climbing up the ladder of success  which
has a million thrills for every round  there is the solid satisfaction
of achievement  there is the good job that keeps one on one s tiptoes
so that one never has a dull moment  there is the happiness that comes
of being employed in constructive work  there is one s own home  with
one s own pots  and pans  and doilies  if one wants them 

take it from me  girls  the woman who espouses a career does not get
the worst husband there is  she has a life companion from whom she
never has to wheedle the pennies  she never has to listen to any back
talk or criticisms  she is never afraid of this companion getting tired
and running off after flappers  it is only the lucky women  who make
exceptional marriages  who are as well off as the business girls who do
not marry 

furthermore  there is this comfort to be given the girl who quits
trying to attract men  and gets busy with her job  men are contrary
creatures  pursue them  and they flee from you  lay traps  and
they walk wide of them  but let them alone  indicate that you are
indifferent to them  that you are concerned with your own affairs in
which they have no part  let them realize that you can get on quite
well without them  and it piques their interest  they come flocking
around of their own accord to see what manner of woman you are 

also the girl who makes something of herself  and who rises high in her
profession is thrown with the men at the top  the men of brains  and
they are often attracted to her while the silly little boys with whom
she used to play about were not 

so i say again to the girls who are not attractive to men  stop wasting
your time in the useless attempt to vamp men  put your heart and your
soul into your job  work is the consolation prize god gives us when we
miss getting the thing we wanted most

lost love


many women ask me how they can regain the love of some man which they
have lost  sometimes  a girl tells me  weeping  of a once ardent lover
who has become cold and neglectful  who no longer comes to see her  and
she wants to know how to bring him back  and make him once more crazy
about her 

oftenest  however  it is a wife who seeks desperately for some magic
whereby she can light again the love fires in the heart of a husband
who has ceased to care for her  who is tired of her  and who does not
even take the trouble to hide from her the fact that he regards her as
a burden  of which he would rid himself if he could 

it is the tragedy of these women that they are doomed to love men
after the men no longer love them  not even neglect  and insult  and
faithlessness  kill their affection for those on whom they have set
their foolish  doglike hearts  so they cling with desperate hands to
the men who are trying to break away from them  hoping against hope 
praying some miracle will happen that will give them back their lost
love 

but their prayers are never answered  the miracle never happens  no
sorcerer can teach a woman how to weave a spell a second time about
a man  the love potions that the credulous buy from fortune tellers 
never work  and though a woman conjure never so deftly  she cannot
bring back the heart that has slipped out of her keeping 

for of all dead things  nothing is so dead as dead love  no power can
breathe into it again the breath of life  and make it a vital thing
once more 

we do not know why we love  we do not know why some particular man or
woman makes a peculiar appeal that makes us prefer him or her to all
the other men and women in the world  we do not know why the touch
of certain hands thrill us  why the quirk of a smile  or the look in
an eye  draws us  why we have a sense of comradeship with certain
individuals  why some man or woman fascinates us  or why we desire
one man or woman more than another  who may be better looking  more
intelligent  more worthy in every way 

nor do we any more know why we cease to love than we know why we love 
we do not know why the touch of the hand that has thrilled us ceases
to thrill  nor why the charm that was once so potent vanishes into
thin air  nor why the fascination flees  and the one who once held us
enthralled becomes a bore who wearies us to tears  it just happens 
and we are as helpless before one situation as before the other 

there are not many men who are cruel enough to find sport in breaking
a woman s heart  and who deliberately win a girl s love  and play with
it  and fling it away  there are not many husbands who would not remain
their wives  eternal lovers  if it was in their power to control their
affections  that was their romantic dream when they married  that way
their happiness lay  and they would have kept their romance had it been
a matter of their own volition 

unfortunately  the disillusion came  the glory and the circling wings
departed  somehow their wives lost their allure for them  and strive
as they might  they could not see them again with the eyes of a lover 
or bring back their charm  many a man would be just as glad to fall in
love again with his wife as she would be to have him fall in love with
her once more  but he cannot do it  you cannot fan dead ashes into a
flame 

perhaps if wives realized how impossible it is to resurrect a dead
love  they would guard the living love more carefully  and run fewer
risks of killing it  they would not take the chance of disillusioning
their husbands by going about sloppy and slovenly at home  and thus
presenting a fatal contrast to the trimly dressed women in their
offices  and the beautified ladies they meet in society  they would
reflect that no man would have much appetite for domestic kisses when
flavored with cold cream  and that if a wife wishes to be regarded as
a ladylove  she must look the part instead of resembling a sack of
potatoes 

and they would see to it that love is not assassinated on their
hearthstones by ceaseless  senseless quarrels  by whining  and
complaining  and nagging  and petty tyrannies  nor would they permit
love to die of that commonest and most deadly ailment  boredom  for if
a woman can interest her husband enough before marriage to make him
pick her out from all the rest of the world for his life partner  she
can interest him enough to hold him until the end of the chapter if she
is willing to take the trouble and perform the labor necessary to do so 

if  though  a woman  through carelessness or ignorance  has lost the
love of the man she loves  there is absolutely no way in which she can
win it back  through duty or a sense of honor she may hold his body 
but his soul has gone from her forever  and she is wise if she accepts
the inevitable 

if she is a girl  she should let the sweetheart who is tired of her go 
instead of trying to hold him  some other man she may make love her 
but not the old one for whom she has lost her charm 

if she is a married woman whose husband has ceased to love her  let
her agonize no more over the impossible task of reviving his passion
for her  let her fill her life with other interests and thank god that
there are so many other pleasant things in the world besides love 

for of this she may rest assured  there is no reviving of dead love 
when once we have lost our taste for a person everything is over  it is
finished  as the french say

the show wedding


the turks have passed a law prohibiting elaborate and costly
marriage ceremonials  and forbidding the giving of expensive wedding
presents  what a pity that we cannot have such an edict issued in
this country  for there is no other one thing that would do more to
allay heartburnings and jealousies  prevent nervous prostration and
bankruptcy  and promote peace and thrift than to officially  can  the
show wedding 

in all fairness  we must admit that the display wedding is a feminine
vice  no man  probably  ever really yearned to make a public exhibition
of himself as he was being led as a lamb to the slaughter  but by the
time she is ten years old the average girl has begun planning her
wedding and deciding whether she will have a big church affair  with
ushers and flower girls and ring bearers and maids and matrons of honor
and bridesmaids and a white satin dress and a real lace veil  and
all the other flubdubs  or whether she will be married at home under
a floral canopy  with an admiring audience fenced off from her by
white ribbons  and to realize this ten minute splurge she is ready to
ruthlessly ruin her family and half kill herself  if she doesn t get
it  she goes through life feeling that she has missed her big moment 
it is from this silly  dopey daydream that women should be rescued by
law  since few of them have the common sense and good taste to put it
aside themselves 

to begin with  it would do away with the disgraceful  barefaced holdups
that precede weddings  these are camouflaged under the appropriate
name of  showers   for they cause every friend of an engaged girl to
shed salt and bitter tears at the realization of how much they will be
mulcted for in silk stocking showers  and handkerchief showers  and
towel showers  and kitchen showers  and all the other showers that
go to make up a bridal deluge  it would also prevent that sinking
feeling at the pit of the stomach with which we are attacked at sight
of a large  thick white envelope in the mail  we know that it means a
 stand and deliver  present  which somehow always comes just at a time
when the rent is overdue  or a doctor bill has to be paid  or we had
saved up a little money by pinching economies to buy a new hat or suit 

it isn t that we are stingy or mean  or that we begrudge a gift to a
friend  it is only that we would like to give when we can do so freely 
and enjoy the giving  instead of having to give at a time when it is
actually dishonest to bestow a present  why  i have known people who
had to put off needed dental work or taking a sick child to the country
when three or four wedding presents fell together  the wedding gift
was a debt of honor   they sent us a set of salad forks    she gave us
a clock when we were married   and it had to be returned in kind  the
abolition of the show wedding would prolong the days of many a poor 
old  hard worked father  whose daughter s trousseau is the straw that
breaks the camel s back 

it is not because she needs them  or has any use for them  that
sally ann  who is a poor girl marrying a poor young man  has to have
piles of orchid chiffon undergarments  hand embroidered and belaced
and beribboned  it is because they are to be displayed to her catty
friends  who will finger them  and appraise them  and criticize them 
and then go home wondering how her father is ever going to pay for
them  if her lingerie were not exhibit a at the wedding sally ann would
go along and provide herself with a reasonable amount of underwear that
would stand wear and washing  and not run papa into debt 

but sally ann has to have her show wedding  she has to trail up the
church aisle in her white satin and her tulle veil  and all the rest
of it  and by the time father has paid for the church and the flowers 
and the bridesmaid s presents  and the reception  and the automobiles 
he has had to borrow money at the bank and has saddled himself with a
debt that bends his back a little more  and puts new lines in his face 
and adds to his burden in work and worry  which was already more than
he could bear  and it has all been for a few minutes  flaunting of
herself in the face of an audience of people who smiled and nudged each
other  and said   did you ever see her look so homely  brides always
look their worst    wonder what he ever saw in her to make him pick her
out    is that the bridegroom  looks like a scared rabbit    how on
earth do you suppose her father will ever pay for this  everybody knows
he can t afford it   and so on  and so on  just what everybody says at
a wedding 

above all  the abolition of the show wedding and the saving of the
foolish expenditure it involved would enable many a young couple to set
up housekeeping out of debt  and  best of all  they would begin life
simply and honestly  and with the admiration and gratitude of all who
know them  getting married is the crucial act in a man s and woman s
life  it is the most awful and solemn thing they ever do  and why they
want to have a thousand curious eyes peering at them when they take the
step that is going to plunge them into hell or lift them into heaven
passes comprehension  it would not be more incongruous to send out
invitations to people to come and watch you die than it is to come and
see you married 

wise that young couple who simply slip around to the parson and make
their vows at the altar  with no one but god to look on

when your children are glad you die


parents seem to run to extremes  of the common  or garden  variety
of fathers and mothers there appears to be two types  one is the
overindulgent  which lavishes too much money  too many fine clothes 
too many motorcars on its offspring  and that brings up its children to
be idle and worthless wasters and spenders  the other type of parent is
the spartan one that is as hard as nails  unsympathetic  close fisted 
that denies its children every indulgence  and that holds to the theory
that the harder it makes life for the young the better it is for them 
both schools of thought are wrong 

undoubtedly  parents make a very great mistake when they sacrifice
everything to their children and make doormats of themselves for their
children to walk on  they weaken their sons and daughters by pampering
them too much and by standing between them and the struggle that alone
makes muscle of body and soul  and they do their children a cruel
injustice by cultivating in them extravagant tastes and habits that
perhaps they cannot later on give them the money to gratify  certainly
it is an unedifying spectacle to behold  as we often do  a mother in
patched  made over clothes  while her daughters fare forth in the
latest imported parisian models  or a seedy father riding on the street
car while son burns up the road in a speedy sports car and is decked
out like solomon in all his glory 

also we can but deplore the folly of parents who skimp  and slave  and
deny themselves every comfort in order that their daughters can make
a splurge in society  and that their sons may loaf through college
courses  where they acquire nothing but a college yell and a contempt
for their hump shouldered old dads  we could weep when we see tired
old women who are converted into unpaid nursemaids by their married
daughters who are always coming in and dumping their babies down on
mother when they want to go off on a trip or play bridge  and what
tears we have left we could shed over the men whose sons are always
getting into trouble and coming back to father for help when they know
that they are robbing him of the pittance he has saved up for his old
age 

but between doing everything for your children and doing nothing at all
for them is a long step  and the parents who do not help their children
to get a start in life fail just as much in doing their duty to them as
do the foolishly fond parents who kill their children s initiative by
swaddling them in cotton wool  of course  necessity is a grim teacher 
if you chuck a child into the water where it must sink or swim  it is
pretty apt to strike out and keep afloat somehow  and it is true that
a great many successful men and women are the children of parents who
were so poor that they could do nothing for them  and that they fought
their way to an education and battled their way to success against all
sorts of hardships  but there is a great difference between the parents
who cannot help their children and those who will not help their
children  between the fathers and mothers who would give their heart s
blood to their children and those who will not give them a few dollars 
and while the children may feel all love and reverence for the poor
parents who were powerless to assist them  they can but feel bitter
resentment toward the parents who stand callously by  watching their
struggles without holding out a helping hand 

a large number of parents have an idea that it does young people good
to be deprived of pleasures  to be reared to no indulgences  to know
hardships  and so even when they have plenty of money they deny their
children pretty clothes and the advantages of education and travel  and
when they get married they let them scuffle for themselves  they do not
give the girl a dowry nor set the boy up in business 

it seems to me that this is a cruel and an inhuman thing to do  and
that it serves no purpose but to kill in the child s breast every
particle of affection it had for its father and mother  for it dooms
the children to years of struggle and self sacrifice  pinching
economies and anxieties that it might so easily have escaped  and god
knows that life is not so easy for any of us that we can afford to have
any of the pleasure taken out of it 

it also often shuts the door of opportunity for the child or puts off
success for many weary years  the few thousands of dollars that father
might have invested in the firm which would have raised tom from being
a clerk to a partner might have carried him on to fortune  if father
would have financed the extra course of study in his profession for
john  he would have achieved success and begun big money making years
before he did  if father had given mary an allowance big enough to
hire servants  she would not have worked herself to death cooking  and
washing  and baby tending  but father wouldn t do it  he held on to
every penny and let his children fight it out the best way they could 
the daughter of such a man once said to me 

 my father is dead and i have inherited a large fortune  but it has
come to me too late to do me any real good  when i was a girl i never
had any pretty clothes  i never had a nice home to invite my friends
to  i never had any indulgences  i never could even go with the people
i was entitled to go with because i did not live in the style they did 
i married a poor man and my father never helped us  i wore my youth out
in housework that i was not strong enough to do  if he had given me
        when i needed it  it would have done me more good than all that
i have inherited does me now  

the moral of all of which is  do not sacrifice yourself to your
children  do not impoverish yourself for them  but help than all you
can while they are young and while they need it  if you do not wish
them to be glad when you are dead and your will is read

what price pleasure 


do you ever ask yourself if you are not paying too high a price for
many of the things in which you indulge yourself  so far as material
things go  most of us are keen enough about seeing that we get our
money s worth  we do not pay a thousand dollars for a string of glass
beads  we do not buy a battered flivver at rolls royce figures  nor
will we stand being charged banquet prices for a corned beef and
cabbage dinner 

when it comes to spiritual values  however  we lose all sense of
proportion  we become spendthrifts  who throw our priceless treasures
away  and we literally sell our birthrights for a mess of pottage  one
thinks of this particularly just now when one watches so many young
persons making such bad and losing bargains with fate  there are the
boys scarcely out of their teens who think it is such a sporting thing 
so dashing  and that it shows that they are such men of the world to
carry flasks on their hips and drink the vile poison that bootleggers
sell  for the sake of the kick they get out of this and for a few
minutes  exhilaration  they are risking not only death itself  but what
is far  far worse  blindness and imbecility and every sort of nervous
ailment 

look at the pasty faced  blear eyed youths with shaking hands that you
see all about you  their minds dulled  their energies paralyzed  their
ambitions killed by drink  who are done with life before they have ever
begun to live  what a price they have paid for booze  can any boy look
at a drunken sot  dirty  poor  despised  and think that the pleasure
that he has got out of drink has paid for what it cost him 

and the girls  the girls who are mad for gaiety  crazy for the
admiration of men  the girls who go on drinking parties  who indulge
in petting parties  who joy ride until all hours of the night  who let
men kiss and fondle them because that is the price that men demand
for taking them out  how cheaply they sell themselves  many a girl
pays with shame and disgrace that follow her to the longest day she
lives for a single wild party  they buy their fun high  these girls
who exchange for it their self respect  their modesty  their maidenly
innocence and their good names 

the family quarrel  that is a domestic luxury for which we have to
pay so dearly that it is never worth the cost  undoubtedly  when one
is feeling cross  and irritable  and disgruntled  there is a certain
luxury in letting go all of one s self control  and turning one s
temper loose  and stabbing right and left with cruel words that wound
like dagger thrusts  also it salves one s own conscience to lay the
blame for everything that goes wrong on some one else  therefore  many
husbands and wives go on a daily orgy of nerves and temper  they vent
their spleen against life on each other  they say to each other all the
mean and hateful things that they are too politic to say to strangers 

but the price they pay  it bankrupts them  for they kill each other s
love  they slay each other s respect  they inevitably come to hate each
other and to cherish secret grudges  born of insult and injustice 
there is no peace nor tenderness in their homes and their marriages
either end in divorce or become long drawn out misery  what a price to
pay for the lack of a little self control 

extravagance  the price of indulging yourself in your youth in the
things that you cannot afford is poverty and dependence in your old
age  the woman who cannot resist pretty clothes  the woman who is
bitten by the society bug and who tries to keep up with people better
off than she is  the man who belongs to lodges  when he can t pay the
rent collector  the man who buys an automobile and a radio on the
instalment plan  they will pay  as sure as fate  for gratifying the
desire of the moment by long years of bitter dependence  twenty or
thirty years from now they will be down and out  and they will either
be in almshouses or the hangers on of relatives  who resent having to
take care of poor uncle john or cousin susan  or they will be burdens
on their children  who are having all they can do to take care of their
own families 

the highest priced cars in the world are not the gold plated 
satin lined jewel boxes made for millionaires  they are the cheap
little cars bought by the people who cannot afford them and who have to
go into debt for them 

and there is the price the lazy pay for shiftlessness  and the price
the mother pays who lets her children roam the streets while she plays
bridge or goes to clubs  and the price the sarcastic pay who alienate
a friend for the sake of making a witty speech  there are a thousand
other little gratifications of a mood or inclination  the desire of a
moment  that we pay for with tears  with loneliness  with failure  with
our very heart s blood  what a pity we don t count the cost of things
before we indulge ourselves in them

the ideal mother


a woman asks   what qualities should the ideal mother possess  

to begin with  a mother should have love  and tenderness  and sympathy 
and be willing to sacrifice herself for her children  these are the
stock virtues of motherhood  and virtually all mothers possess them 
but they alone do not make a woman a good mother  often they do as
much harm as good  for you can ruin a child by blind devotion  you
can enfeeble it by too much tenderness  you can make it a selfish
egotist and an overbearing brute by making yourself a doormat for it
to walk over  so to love  tenderness  sympathy and unselfishness the
ideal mother must add other qualities  and the most important of these
is the ability to see her job as a whole and to realize that she is
responsible for the finished goods that she turns out 

not many mothers have this vision  or  rather  they shut their eyes
and refuse to see that the molding of their children s characters 
the settling of their destinies  is in their own hands  they let a
high tempered child grow up undisciplined and without teaching it any
self control  they let a slothful  lazy one grow up without forming
habits of industry  they never teach a self indulgent  greedy child to
curb its appetite  they spoil and pamper their children  and then they
say that they  hope  their children will turn out all right 

the ideal mother knows that you form children s characters in the
cradle  and so she does not trust to luck with her youngsters  she
begins when they are babies to teach them self control  and thrift 
and industry  and all the principles of right living  the ideal mother
must have a backbone  unfortunately  most mothers permit their hearts
to crowd out their spinal column until they have no more backbone than
a fishing worm  this is why you hear women say despairingly that they
can t do a thing with their    year old child 

it takes nerve  and grit  and determination  and courage to fight
self willed youngsters  and mother is too soft to do it  so she gives
in rather than listen to her baby s howls of rage or go through the
struggle of conquering a disobedient child  and the inevitable result
is that her children have a contempt for her as a weakling  and ride
roughshod over her  and become the outbreaking young hoodlums who fill
our jails and brothels 

the ideal mother is a human being  she doesn t pose before her children
as a plaster saint or an oracle on a pedestal  one of the reasons why
children do not confide in their parents is because the average father
and mother pretend that they were such models of all the virtues when
they were young that their children feel they have nothing in common
with them and that they wouldn t understand how a boy or girl feels who
wants to do all sorts of foolish things 

how can a girl tell her mother that a boy kissed her  if mother
represents herself as miss prunes and prisms  and says that when  she 
was young girls never skylarked  and never went on joy rides or to
cabarets  or held hands in the movies  but spent a pleasant evening
sitting up in the parlor in the presence of their elders discussing
improving topics 

it is the human mothers who can sympathize with their children s desire
for good times and help them to them  who will stretch a point to get
a girl a new frock or a boy the fraternity pin he craves  who get well
enough acquainted with their children to really help them and guard
them 

the ideal mother has a sense of proportion  she doesn t see her
ducklings as swans  her love doesn t blind her to her children s faults
and blemishes  rather it sharpens her vision  so that she gets a line
on them as they really are  thereby she is enabled to help them make
the most of such gifts as they have  she sees that tom is brilliant
but unstable and lacking in purpose  and she holds him to whatever he
undertakes to do until she forms the habit of steadfastness in him 
she sees that john is dull but a plodder  and she trains him for some
occupation in which quickness of mind is not demanded and in which
the prizes go to faithfulness and hard work  she sees that mary is
intelligent but homely  and lacking the charms that allure men  so
she gives her some occupation by which she can make a good living for
herself and which will fill her life with interest  and this sense of
proportion keeps her from making her children ridiculous by bragging
about them  and boring every one with whom she comes in contact with
endless stories of what wonderful and marvelous creatures they are 
and how  wherever they go  they are the cynosure of all eyes and the
admiration of all beholders 

finally  the ideal mother should have a sense of humor that will enable
her to laugh instead of cry over many of her children s peccadilloes
and keep her from taking them too seriously  for the thing that ails
young people is chiefly youth  and they will get over that if you
will give them a little time  because they are idle  irresponsible 
pleasure loving  dance mad  girl and boy crazy is no reason for
prophesying dismal things about them and wringing your hands in
despair  it is a passing phase of life at which we elders may well
grin  remembering the time when we also were young and foolish  an old
woman who had raised up a remarkable family of sons and daughters once
gave me this as her recipe for bringing up children   kiss them when
they are good  spank them when they re bad and teach them to obey you  
that is the whole of the law and the prophets

how to catch a wife


 you are always telling girls how to catch husbands   says a young man 
 why don t you give us chaps a few tips about how to get wives  

well  son  perhaps i unconsciously favor women because i belong to
their lodge  also  it is more difficult for a woman to catch a husband
than it is for a man to get a wife  not only because women are more
inclined to matrimony than men are  but because a woman s pursuit of
a man has to be stealthy and secret and under cover  with all of her
tracks carefully hidden and her purposes veiled  whereas a man can go
after a woman openly and aboveboard  with everybody looking on and
applauding the chase  therefore  the woman is more in need of any stray
hints that may improve her technique than the man is  still  far be it
from me to withhold from my brothers any information i may have about
the short cuts to the feminine heart  so to the really earnest seeker
after knowledge on this subject i would say 

first  study your girl  catalogue her  find out to what type she
belongs and adapt your tactics to the situation  for all women no more
rise to the same line of courtship than all fish bite at the same bait 
there are some feminine hearts that can only be taken by assault and
battery and others that surrender to patient siege  there are women
whose love is for sale to the highest bidder and others who bestow it
in pity  there are women who like a business proposition and women who
fall only for the romantic wooing  so there you are  and your success
will depend upon your ability to psychoanalyze the particular woman and
upon the skill with which you suggest to her that you are the great
unsatisfied need of her soul 

if the girl is of the clear eyed  upstanding  competent business
type  your best method of winning her is by the good  old  well tried
platonic friendship method  she isn t anxious to exchange a mahogany
desk for a kitchen range nor to give up a good pay envelope and an easy
job to toil for some man for nothing  likewise  she has worked with men
too long for her to see any rosy halo around the masculine brow  so
she is pretty apt to shy off at any suggestion of marriage and balk at
the thought of the altar  but life lacks savor to every woman without
masculine society  and so this particular type of woman is especially
allured by the idea of a beautiful and satisfying friendship with some
man  and when a chap has got his toe that far into the door to a
woman s heart it is his own fault if he does not open it all the way 

only there is this word of warning  never pop the question to the
business girl in the morning of a sunshiny day when she has on a new
frock and a good hat and everything is going swimmingly at the office
and she feels fit and fine and ready to buck the world  instead  choose
a rainy evening  when she is sitting alone at home  dejected and
forlorn  when she is tired and the boss has been grumpy  then the thing
she wants most on earth is just a nice  strong masculine shoulder to
cry on 

if the girl you want is a flapper  your best ally is your bankbook  all
you need to look good to her is to be a good spender and a fast worker 
hold not your hand and count not the cost of jewelry and trinketry and
candy and flowers and cabarets and eats and joy rides  and remember
that the man with the longest purse wins  some day she will jazz with
you to the preacher  and you will live scrappily ever afterward 

if the girl upon whom your affections are set is a demure little
puritan  make her your mother confessor  confide to her all your sins 
real and imaginary  invent a dark past for her benefit  make her
believe that but for her sacred influence you would become an abandoned
character and that she alone can lead you up to the higher life  all
women have the reformation complex  and the better they are and the
less they know of the world the harder they fall for the belief that a
grown man s character is like a piece of dough that they can mold into
any shape they please  once let a girl get the idea into her head that
she is responsible for your soul  and she is yours for the taking 

if the girl you want is one that you made mud pies with in childhood
and went to school with  and who refuses to see you in a sentimental
light  don t be discouraged by her telling you that she will be a
sister to you  just keep right on strutting your rachel and jacob
stuff  mighty few women can resist that  make yourself a habit with the
girl  make yourself necessary to her happiness and comfort by always
paying her the little attentions that women like  fetch and carry for
her  be the one person in the world she can always depend upon to make
life pleasant and agreeable for her 

then suddenly drop her cold  begin paying furious attentions to some
woman she always accuses of being made up and older than she looks and
an artful hussy  and it is a hundred to one bet that she will call you
back and let you see that her feelings toward you were not at all what
she had supposed they were  for when she thinks you are about to marry
another woman she will wake up to the fact that life will be cinders 
ashes and dust without you 

if the girl you desire is one of the morbid sort who hangs between  i
will  and  i won t   who is always vivisecting her heart and taking
her emotional temperature  what you need to use is caveman methods 
she is just dying to have you drag her to the altar by the hair of her
head  and if you are half a man you will do it  don t ever ask that
kind of a woman to marry you  tell her you are going to marry her and
that you have the license and the ring in your pocket and are on the
way to the chapel with her  and you will give her a thrill that will
last a lifetime 

these are only a few of the many ways to win a wife  it is dead easy 
and any man can do it who has gumption enough to work out a cross word
puzzle

dangerous girls


chief among the women from whom a young man should pray his guardian
angel to deliver him is the hinting girl  she is a gentle grafter who
holds up every man she meets with a pair of innocent looking blue eyes
that bid him stand and deliver just as effectually and efficiently as
if he were looking down the barrels of a couple of blue nosed revolvers
in the hands of a highway robber  you will find these cheerful
workers  son  where you least expect them  the very highest society is
filled with girls of undisputed position and unquestioned morals  who
ruthlessly plunder every man they meet  and you will never encounter an
individual more to be feared than these bandits of the parlor 

did you ever wonder why one girl receives so many more presents than
another  and why every man who passes lays some offering on her shrine 
take it from me  this is the result of science and not mere chance 
observe  closely  and you will see  when you call  that she steers the
conversation artfully around to the latest play  and before you know it
you have offered to take her to it 

also  she has let you know that violets are her favorite flower  and
the date of her birthday  before christmas she artlessly confides
in you where there is the jeweled vanity  or the hand painted fan 
that she has set her heart upon  and she couldn t shout it at you any
plainer if she bawled it to you through a megaphone that she expects
you to come across  and will think you a piker if you don t 

beware the hinting girl  son  she is the woman who is accessory before
the crime of half of the embezzlements of trusted clerks who go wrong 
and who  if she got her deserts  would stand in the prisoners  dock
by the side of the poor  weak  trembling boy who has stolen to buy
her jewels or to give her a good time  and she makes the sort of wife
whose husband rises up and sits down to a never ending chant of  gimme 
gimme  gimme  

then there s the girl with a past  very often she has been more sinned
against than sinning  probably her morals are just as good as your
own  son  but  even so  such marriages rarely turn out happily  for we
have to face the naked fact that  while a man may love a woman well
enough to forget and forgive her indiscretions  society  which is not
in love with her  remembers them all  and it reminds her husband that
it recalls them  the man who marries a woman with a past is pretty
much in the same fix as the man who hires a reformed embezzler to be
his cashier  he hopes he will run straight  but he keeps an eye on
the cash box a situation which doesn t make for domestic felicity  of
course  there are women who reform and gather in their wild oats crops
and ever after raise nothing but garden truck around their doorstep 
but even while their husbands are devouring their domestic cabbages
and onions there rarely comes a family spat in which they do not throw
in their wives  teeth the kind of farmers they have been  the truth
is that it takes a big man and woman to defy the conventions  that is
what makes it safest for those of us who are little people to play the
game according to the rules laid down by hoyle  and one of these rules
is that women must keep their skirts clean  by and large it is a good
rule  son  for it means the purity of race  the integrity of society
and a lot of other things that keep this old world going 

then there s the weeping girl  whenever you meet with a gentle 
sweet  soft  babyish looking little girl  with a chin that trembles
and big eyes that overflow with tears at the slightest provocation 
and who can cry without her nose getting red  fly  son  fly  she will
fasten herself upon you  and when you try to make a getaway she will
cling to you and weep  and no man can behold unmoved a woman crying
for him  because he is such a good thing  you will stop to wipe her
eyes  and all will be over with you except the long  long years of
rainy matrimony when you will have to deal with a wife who cannot be
reasoned with or cajoled or coerced into doing anything she doesn t
want to do  because you will be so afraid of starting another freshet
of tears 

then there s the domestic girl  who baits her hook with angels  food 
you might go farther and do worse than marry the domestic girl  for
while romance is transient one s appetite remains  and after one s
illusions are gone it is a comfortable thing to have a good dinner to
fall back upon  still  one must confess  the domestic girl is apt to
have only a bread and butter conversation  of which a man might tire
in time  so  unless your stomach is developed in excess of your heart 
walk warily when the domestic girl begins to inveigle you into little
meals for two that she cooks for you under a pink shaded lamp 

lastly  there is the girl who is just near you the girl you work with 
or who lives in the same boarding house with you  or who comes to visit
your sister  men who have escaped the dangers of all other women are
the victims of propinquity which unites them to ladies they couldn t
otherwise have seen through a telescope  somehow our very nearness to
the people with whom we are thrown every day keeps us from getting a
perspective on their faults and disabilities  and habit deceives us
into thinking that they are more necessary to us than they are  and so
we drift into the mismated marriages that keep the divorce courts busy
and the world salted down with the brine of our tears 

therefore  if you perceive that mamie  whom you thought vulgar at
first  no longer gets on your nerves  if you observe that sadie  who
bored you when you first met her  is beginning to interest you with her
chatter about what  he said  and  i said   and you discover that you
have quit being shocked by carrie s gum chewing and mabel s grammar 
then  son  pack your trunk and leave while the leaving is good 
otherwise  the girl next to you will get you sure 

but why amplify the list  some day a girl will tag you  and you will
know you are  it   and a million warnings could not save you from your
fate

when a girl loves a man


a youth asks me how he can tell whether a girl loves him or not  well 
son  you can t always tell  there are times when all signs fail  and
there is no man so clever  so discerning  so sophisticated that a
woman cannot fool him if she set her mind to doing so  for the many
generations in which women were entirely subservient to men  and in
which they had to get everything they had out of men  and in which
all their pleasures and perquisites depended on their wheedling and
cajoling men  have made them gifted liars and adept at befooling men 

however  the modern girl  being able to make her own living  and stand
upon her own feet  and therefore being to a large degree independent of
men  has less need to simulate emotions which she does not feel  and
so she has lost the fine technique of her mother and her grandmother
and her great great great grandmother  flirting has become a lost
art  and the methods of the gold digger are so crude and raw that any
man who is taken in by one deserves all he gets  the average girl is
almost brutally frank about the state of her feelings  she hasn t even
subtlety enough about her to keep a man guessing 

but there is  of course  a sort of no man s land that lies between
liking and loving in which the girl wanders  herself as uncertain and
bewildered as you are  and  i take it  it is across this dangerous
terrain that you wish to be guided  sally is dear and sweet to you 
she apparently enjoys your society  and you never have any trouble in
making dates with her  she is the best little pal ever  but what you
want to know is whether she cares for you just as she does for half a
dozen other chaps  or whether you are the only one 

first  is she willing to sit at home of an evening with you or not 
if she comes down with her hat on to receive you  or if she always
wants to step out somewhere  you have not touched her heart  she
regards you merely as a purveyor of good times  a theater ticket and
a dancing partner  and any other youth who had the price would do as
well  but things have got serious with her when she proposes to spend
the evening at home under a pink shaded lamp  that shows that she has
begun to live a romance with more thrills to it than anything she can
see depicted on the stage  and that she thinks that valentino is a poor
dub at love making compared to you  also it indicates that she desires
to isolate you  to cut you out from the herd and put her brand upon
you  cupid is essentially a monopolist  especially the lady cupid  the
first thing that a woman does when she falls in love with a man is to
try to shut him away from all other women  so long as a girl wants to
go in crowds there is nothing doing with her in the love line  if she
really cares for you  she will maneuver to get you off to herself 

next  observe how a girl treats your pocketbook  if she gets everything
out of you that she can  if  when you go out  she has to have a taxi
to convey her three blocks  although she can walk ten miles around a
department store without turning a hair  if she always suggests orchids
when flowers are mentioned  and invariably picks out the most expensive
places to dance and the highest priced dishes on the menu  you may be
certain that she has no serious intentions concerning you  you are
merely the good thing that a merciful providence has brought forward
for her sustenance  but when a girl begins to talk economy to a boy 
when she suggests going to the movies instead of to the theatre  when
she orders a ham sandwich instead of a chicken breast and mushrooms
under glass  it is an unmistakable sign that she is regarding his
bankroll as her own and is commencing to save up for furniture for her
future home 

next and this is an acid test talk to the girl about yourself and
observe her reaction to it  monologue along to her by the hour about
what you are doing  about what you have done in the past and what you
expect to do in the future  tell her all about what you said to the
boss and what the boss said to you  explain to her all the details of
the grocery business  regale her with reminiscences of your childhood 
when you were a fat little boy with green freckles on your hands 

if she yawns in your face or if she listens with the expression of a
martyr being nailed to the cross  if she gets up and walks around the
room or turns on the radio or interrupts you to ask what you think
of the president s foreign policy  you may as well abandon hope  her
affection is merely gold plated  not the real thing  but if she laps up
your talk about yourself and asks for more  if she begs you to repeat
that darling story of how naughty you were to your nurse  and if she
sits  goggle eyed with excitement  on the edge of her chair while you
relate how you sold a bill of goods to a hard customer  rest assured
that her heart is yours for keeps  for there are only two women in the
world  a man s mother and the woman who is his wife or hopes to be his
wife  who want to hear him talk about himself 

take note also of a girl s attitude toward you  as long as she regards
you as an intelligent  husky  able bodied man  capable of taking care
of yourself and with sense enough to come in out of the rain  her
regard for you is merely platonic  but when a girl suddenly becomes
anxious about the state of your health  when she worries over your
getting your feet wet and is afraid you are not getting enough
vitamines in your diet  when she warns you not to forget to put on your
overcoat if it is cold and to look out for automobiles when you cross
the street  then it is safe to begin pricing engagement rings 

of course  there are other signs of love  such as a girl developing an
acute attack of domesticity and passing up the display of french frocks
in a window for that of aluminum pots and pans  and especially when she
begins dragging a man to church with her  which are not to be ignored 
but when a maiden begins to mother a chap and indicates that her idea
of spending a perfectly hilarious evening is just to be alone with him 
listening to him talk about himself  she is his for the taking

marriage lessons


what has marriage taught you 

 the chief thing that marriage has taught me   said a man who has
had forty years of experience in matrimony   is that women are human
beings  when a man acquires that piece of information it always gives
him a bit of a jolt  for most men never really think of women as
human beings at all  they think  according to their kind  of women
as angels  above all earthly passions  with no nerves or tempers  or
selfish cravings for pleasure and who find their joy in life in loving
the unlovable and forgiving the unforgivable and being a sweet  gooey 
sticky mass of gentleness and patience and unselfishness  or they think
of women as being baby dolls to be dressed up and played with and put
on the shelf when they are tired of them  or they think of women as
pieces of household machinery sort of automatic  self starting cooks
and carpet sweepers and washers and menders  who run on their own power
and who don t even have to be oiled up with a few lubricating words of
praise now and then 

 and so husbands treat their wives according to their conception of
what women are  and that is why marriage is so often a failure and why
there are so many divorces  women don t want to be regarded either
as saints or toys or domestic conveniences  they want to be treated
as human beings and have their husbands give them the same sort of a
square deal a man gives his business partner 

 about nine tenths of the spats that married people have are over
money  it gets on the husband s nerves to have the woman eternally
dunning him for money  it seems to him that before he gets his hat
off in the evening she begins asking for a few dollars for this and
for that  then the bills come in  and they are always bigger than he
expected  and he rows about it  and she thinks that he is stingy 

 the trouble is that the man isn t treating his wife like a rational
human being  he is expecting her to be a miracle worker and run a house
on air  he is humiliating her and making her feel that he is a tyrant
by making her come like a beggar to him for every penny because he
has got an idea that women don t mind panhandling  furthermore  he is
expecting her to gauge her expenditures wisely  when she hasn t the
faintest idea of what her resources are 

 i have found out that it saves friction over money to make my wife
as liberal an allowance as i can  i have found out that if you will
explain to a woman just exactly how the financial situation stands
in the family and why you can t afford the thing she wants she will
not only do without it gladly but cut down her expenses in other ways
and help you to save  it is believing that their husbands are holding
out on them and not splitting fifty fifty with them that makes women
reckless spenders 

 and i have found that a man is a fool who lies to his wife  in the
end she always catches up with him  and then she imagines things ten
times worse than they were  if a man telephones his wife that he is
going to stay downtown and meet a customer from oshkosh and she learns
that he really played poker with the boys she pictures a scene of wild
debauchery and leaps to the conclusion that he is leading the double
life and he never hears the last of it  but if he tells her just what
he is going to do she is so flattered at being trusted and thought
broadminded enough not to begrudge her husband an evening s pleasure
that she goes to bed and goes to sleep instead of waiting up for him
with a curtain lecture sizzling in her mind 

 marriage has taught me that women think more of words than they do of
deeds and that a woman would rather have her husband tell her that he
loves her than to have him work his fingers to the bone for her and
never make her a soft speech  as long as a husband tells his wife how
beautiful she is and how he would like to deck her out in diamonds
and sables she is perfectly content to do without them and wear
hand me downs  it is only when she thinks that he doesn t care whether
she has fine clothes or not that she gets peevish over not having the
finery that other women have 

 marriage has taught me that in the family circle the hammer is a
boomerang that returns and annihilates the hammerer  if you knock your
wife s cooking she says   what s the use of trying to please you   and
makes no effort to improve  but if you praise her dinners she breaks
her neck trying to make them better and better  if you criticize the
size of the bills she revenges herself by buying something that really
cost money  but if you tell her what a help she is to you and what a
marvelous manager  she becomes a nickel nurser 

 if you find fault with her hat or her dress  you have to buy her a new
one  but if you tell her how becoming her last year s costume is and
how it brings out her lines  she will wear it into shreds  marriage
has taught me that if you let your wife know that you admire her and
appreciate her  that you are grateful to her for all that she does for
you and that you try to do all in your power to make her happy  she
will repay you a thousandfold and there is nothing she won t do for you
and no fault she won t overlook in you

the superior business woman


the other day a man killed his beautiful young wife because she was a
better  business man  than he was and made more money  the woman loved
her husband and was good to him  she was ambitious for him  she got
him a job with the people for whom she worked and tried to push him
along and help him in every way  but it simply was not in him to be the
go getter that she was  she was a success and he was a failure  and in
the frenzy of morbid jealousy that this engendered in him  he slew her 

thus vividly do we have brought to our attention one of the new
difficulties that the advent of women into the business world has
injected into the already complicated matrimonial proposition  it
makes the question of how the modern wife can best be a helpmeet to
her husband one that takes a solomon in petticoats to answer  in olden
times the matter was perfectly simple  the woman who wanted to help
her husband along had only to be a good and thrifty manager  to pare
the potatoes thin enough and squeeze the nickels  she did her part in
building up the family fortunes by saving  but  in many cases to day 
the old woman s granddaughter is a crackerjack business woman who
sees that she can help her husband more by earning than by scrimping 
and that she can make more money in one year in business than she
could save in ten years by doing her own housework and wearing shabby
clothes  so  as long as she is working for their common good  the woman
cannot understand why her husband shouldn t be just as willing for her
to help him by working in an office as in a kitchen  or why the wife
who does brain labor isn t as good a wife as the one who does manual
labor 

but the great majority of women who continue to follow any gainful
pursuit after marriage find out that  while there is a new woman who
looks at everything in life from a new angle  there is no new man 
women have changed in their relationship to man  but men stand pat just
where adam did when it comes to dealing with women 

if you will notice  it is only women who prate about equality between
the sexes  men take no stock in any such heresy  when a man tells a
woman that she is an angel and that he looks up to her and worships
her  it is one of the lover s perjuries at which jove laughs  in
reality he doesn t mean a word of it  the very basic thing on which a
man s love for a woman is built is his sense of superiority to her 
he wants to feel stronger than she is  wiser than she is  to be more
successful than she is  she must look up to him  revere him  ask his
opinion  be guided by his advice 

that is why the clinging vine type of woman is so appealing to men 
and it is why intelligent  big brained men so often marry morons and
are happy and contented with them  their silly little wives do not
understand one word in five they say and are no companions to them  but
they satisfy the masculine demand to dominate the woman  when the case
is reversed  as it often is  and when the wife is the more intelligent 
the stronger character when the gray mare is the better horse and
pulls most of the load the marriage is invariably unhappy  and the
husband almost invariably either openly or secretly hates his wife 
his love for her is never strong enough to survive the hurt to his
vanity  his sense of inferiority to her keeps his nerves raw  and if
he is dependent upon her it turns his very soul to wormwood and gall 
i have never known a woman who supported her husband who received any
gratitude for it  he would eat her bread  but he did it as a snapping
dog that bites the hand that feeds it 

there is nothing that fills a woman s cup of happiness so full and
overflowing as for her husband to achieve a notable success and be
great and famous  she glories in being mrs  explorer or mrs  engineer
or mrs  banker or mrs  author  and loves to shine in the reflected
glory  but the deadliest insult you can offer any man is to speak
of him as his wife s husband and call him mr  mary smith  although
mary may have written the book of the year or have performed some
achievement that has made the world sit up and take notice of her 

perhaps all of this is natural  perhaps this cosmic urge that the male
has to dominate the female is something instinctive for which he is not
responsible 

but it makes the woman s course a hard one to steer  for  curiously
enough  the weak man is often attracted to the strong woman  and there
is something maternal in the strong woman that wants to mother the weak
man and makes her feel that he only needs her to take care of him and
boost him and show him the way to success 

so the girl who is making a big salary marries the man who is making a
small one  and she tries to supply for him the business sense he lacks
and to galvanize him into a hustle of which he is incapable  and they
live scrappily ever afterward  yet there is nothing we can do about
it as long as nature goes blundering along putting the brains and
talents of merchants and bankers and trust presidents into a lot of
women s heads and making plenty of men who would have been wonderful
housekeepers and done perfectly lovely embroidery work if only they
hadn t got the wrong sex

new ideals for old


the strangest thing in this age of strange things is the new
relationship that is growing up between the sexes  so many of the
ideals that have ruled us for centuries have been scrapped and swept
into the discard that the boy and girl babies of to day are virtually
born into a new world where few of the conventions that ruled their
parents survive  take the matter of financial independence  for
instance  since the caveman days it has been held that the proper
attitude of woman was one of dependence on her lord and master  the
woman bore the children and kept the house  and the husband provided
the wherewithal to support the family  when a woman had property her
husband took possession of it on the day they were married  virtually
every lucrative occupation was barred to women  when a man and a woman
went to any place of amusement the man would have been highly insulted
if she had offered to pay any part of the cost of the entertainment 
man was the purse bearer  and his lordly gesture indicated that he had
the checking account of mr  rockefeller and that woman was a dear
little sweetie who was not to bother her poor little foolish head over
the cost of anything 

to day the majority of women earn their living before they are married 
financial independence has become so necessary to their happiness that
one of the potent sources of domestic discord is the inability of the
woman who has had her own pay envelope to do without it and reconcile
herself to taking whatever her husband gives her as recompense for her
hard work as a poor man s wife  also husbands are coming more and more
to begrudge spending money on their wives and are demanding oftener
and oftener that the wage earning girls they marry shall keep on with
their jobs  likewise  it is a common thing for the young women who go
out with young men to places of amusement to pay their own way and go
fifty fifty on all expenses 

this may be fair enough  certainly  when men and women work side by
side and the woman gets the same salary as the man there is no more
reason why he should feed her and buy her theater tickets than why she
should buy his  perhaps it is only logical that when woman fought for
and won financial independence she should have to pay the price of her
victory  but what i am trying to show is that man s attitude toward
woman as regards money has changed  she has shown that she can make her
own living and he lets her do it  even fathers have now no such sense
of responsibility about providing for their daughters as they used to
have  men no longer adopt the gallant  i ll pay your way  pose  they
treat women about money as they would treat another man  of course  the
occupation of wifehood and motherhood is a strenuous one and is all
that any woman can be expected to do properly  but it is becoming more
and more evident that men are less willing to support their families
and that in the future women are going to have to continue to be
wage earners even after they are married 

another curious shift of masculine thought is about feminine modesty 
in the past  no matter what a man s own life might have been  he
demanded unsullied innocence in the woman he married  his ideal was the
shrinking violet  the bud with the dew upon it  in these days there are
few peaches with the down still left upon them  they have nearly all
been manhandled  girls display their bodies with an abandon that would
have made the most hardened woman blush fifty years ago  debutantes
tell stories that would paralyze their grandmothers if they could hear
them  young women think no more of kissing every tom  dick and harry
who comes along and in indulging in petting parties and  necking   than
their mothers would have thought of shaking hands and holding a casual
conversation  girls excuse themselves for indulging in these dangerous
and degrading practises by saying that unless they do they receive no
attention from men  they speak the truth  men may still theoretically
admire what they call  the old fashioned girl   but they leave her to
spend her evenings with her parents  few men in these days can hope
to marry a girl who has not been kissed and pawed over  and so it is
obvious that men are changing their opinions about the desirability of
modesty in women and establishing a single standard of conduct for both
sexes  that is just  but it does not make for morality or the uplift of
humanity 

men and women both approach marriage in a different spirit  in the back
of most young people s heads as they march to the altar is the thought
that if they don t like it they won t stick to it  it is an experiment 
and they will try anything once  and if it doesn t come up to what
the novelists and poets have press agented it to be they can always
fly to the divorce court  that is one reason why marriage is so often
a failure  neither husband nor wife makes an honest effort to make a
success of it  of course  there are exceptions to all rules  there are
husbands who gladly support their families  there are girls who have
kept themselves unsullied and their lips virginal  there are men and
women who still hold marriage a sacrament  but for the great majority
of men and women there are new ideals and a new attitude toward each
other  and whether these are better or worse than the old only time can
tell

why divorce is common


when we hear about a couple getting a divorce on the grounds of
incompatibility of temper we instinctively feel that it is too trivial
a reason for breaking up a home and we condemn them as poor sports
who did not have enough grit to carry on and make the best of their
bargain  if it had been something big  now drunkenness  the drug habit 
infidelity if the husband had been a brute who beat his wife  or the
wife a virago  we could have sympathized with them  but just to get a
divorce because they didn t think alike on politics and religion and
hadn t the same taste in pie  pooh  quitters  a yellow streak  we ve no
pity for them 

yet when you come to think of it  is there really anything else in
the whole wide world that comes so near to justifying divorce as
incompatibility of temper  is there any other such good reason for a
man and woman parting and going their separate ways as the fact that
they have not one thought or desire or interest in common  and is there
any other torture comparable with having to live in intimate daily
contact with a person who continually rubs your fur the wrong way  who
gets on your nerves  who rasps your sensibilities and keeps you in a
perpetual bad humor  it is a lot easier to forgive an occasional big
fault than it is to put up with never ending petty irritations  the big
sinners at least take a day off from their vices now and then  but the
little sinners who sin against our habits and ideals and conventions
are always on the job  so when you think of this and consider the
difficulties there are in the way of every man and woman who get
married adjusting themselves to each other  you are not surprised that
divorce is so common  you only wonder that it isn t universal 

here are two persons of different sexes  doomed by nature to look at
everything from different standpoints and to react differently to every
situation  back of them is a different heredity  often a different
race  in their veins flow alien currents of blood  they have been
brought up with different standards  in different schools of thought 
different habits have been bred in them  they worship different gods
and at different altars and eat different dishes 

what marvel that such a couple come to grief on the rocks of
incompatibility of temper  the miracle of it is that any of them have
the wit and wisdom to steer around it  but the terrible and pathetic
thing about it is that in hundreds of these cases in which husbands and
wives live a cat and dog life and make each other perfectly miserable 
or else break their marriage vows  nobody is really to blame  each is
perfectly right from his or her standpoint  only they can t agree  they
can t adjust themselves to each other  the woman who has been brought
up in a happy go lucky household  where the only use any one saw for a
dollar was to spend it as quickly as possible  where meals were movable
feasts that were as likely to happen at one hour as another  is a thorn
in the side of a husband who has been trained from his youth up to make
a fetich of thrift  order and promptness 

on the other hand  the woman whose mother has brought her up to make
a sacred rite of cleanliness and who scrubs the back of every kitchen
shelf and regards a chair out of place or ashes on the rug as a high
crime and misdemeanor  is fretted into nervous prostration by a husband
who never can be taught to wipe his feet on the doormat or kept from
mussing up the best sofa cushion 

there are women who die of broken hearts  frozen to death by the
coldness of their husbands  they have come from warm hearted 
demonstrative families  they have been accustomed to having a fuss made
over them and to seeing their father s loverlike attentions to their
mother  and they think that their husbands do not love them  because
they never tell them so  they cannot understand the dumb  repressed
temperament that is utterly incapable of showing what it feels  then
there is the gay  pleasure loving man who likes to dance and dine in
restaurants and jazz  the good fellow whom everybody likes and who
has holes in his pockets that no wife s economy can ever sew up  what
superhuman wisdom and patience it takes in a woman to keep from nagging
him if she has been brought up in an austere family that frowned on all
frivolous amusements and whose watchword was duty instead of good times 

then there is the eternal conflict over little trivial personal habits
and ways  over things as small as cooking  irvin cobb said once that
the civil war was fought not over secession or slavery but over hot
bread and cold bread  certainly many thirty or forty year family wars
are waged over what strength the breakfast coffee shall be and the
use of onions in the soup  and certainly it is no trivial matter for
one accustomed to a sophisticated  highly cultured cuisine to have
to insult your palate with plain  ignorant  boiled food because the
partner of your bosom has had his or her early education in eating
neglected  probably no woman who has been reared in the belief that
one s good clothes should be kept for company and that any sort of
old messy duds were good enough for home consumption can realize the
disgust she inspires in her husband s breast when she comes down to
breakfast in a boudoir cap and a soiled kimono and no complexion if he
is of the fastidious sort to whom slovenliness is a mortal sin 

these little things the niceties of life that one has been taught to
observe and the other hasn t  the order and thrift one has been bred
to and the other hasn t  the difference in point of view  in taste  in
habit make the inevitable friction between husbands and wives which is
at the bottom of almost every divorce  and when you think how hard it
is to give up our old opinions and ways of doing things  the wonder
is that so many persons are able to do it and that so many couples do
adjust themselves to each other and get along in reasonable peace and
harmony

the children pay


no disinterested outsider ever observes the spats in which so many
husbands and wives continually engage without realizing that they
quarrel because they enjoy doing so  it is an indoor sport out of which
they get a morbid thrill  domestic life has become dull and monotonous
to them  they have nothing new and interesting to say to each other 
and so one or the other starts something by making a remark that he
or she knows is the fighting word that will inevitably precipitate a
scrimmage  and then they go to it  hammer and tongs  it is their way
of putting pep into a pepless day  for they know the danger they are
running  and the very fact that they are risking their whole life s
happiness crisps their nerves  as going over the top did the soldiers
in the war  besides which they get a strange and savage joy out of
stabbing with cruel words and in wounding and being wounded by the ones
they love and who love them 

it is because married couples love a fight for the fight s sake that so
many homes are nothing but a battlefield on which a perpetual warfare
goes on  otherwise the dove of peace would roost on the roof of many
a household to which the black flag is now nailed  for it is folly to
say that the average husband and wife who are forever engaged in an
acrimonious debate over every trifle that comes up could not get along
with each other if they desired to do so  they get along with other
persons  they make allowance for the prejudices and faults of others 
they permit other persons to differ from them on matters of opinion and
taste  they sidestep other persons  peculiarities  they control their
tempers and their tongues when they are dealing with others  they are
tactful and diplomatic in handling other persons  no doctor would ever
have another patient  no merchant another customer  no man could hold
his job if he was as irritable  as grouchy  as high tempered abroad as
many a man is at home  and if he said the insulting things to other
persons that he says to his wife  no woman would ever be invited to
another bridge party or elected president of the sewing society if she
were as much of a spitfire in public as many a woman is in private  and
if she said the nasty things to others that she says to her husband 

now  the rules for keeping the peace are the same everywhere  and both
men and women are familiar with them  every man knows that there isn t
a woman living that he can t make eat out of his hand by showing her a
few attentions  a little tenderness and consideration and paying her
a few compliments  every woman knows that there isn t a man that she
can t jolly along the way she wants him to go and who does not respond
to judiciously applied salve  so when husbands and wives  who know
perfectly well how to work each other without friction  deliberately
and with malice aforethought rub each other the wrong way  it is
obviously because they enjoy their daily dozen fracases and find fun
in seeing the fur fly  if that were the end of it  we might well shrug
our shoulders and  while wondering at their taste  leave them to
take their pleasure as they saw fit in the cruel pastime of baiting
each other  but  unfortunately  the family spat is not the innocent
diversion that husbands and wives appear to think it is  nor does it
end when the husband puts on his hat and bangs the door behind him and
goes downtown  and the wife wipes away a tear or two and goes about her
daily tasks 

the children are the real victims in these family fights  it is they
who stumble from the domestic battleground with shattered nerves 
with torn and bleeding spirits and souls  with maimed and deformed
characters  all of us have known children who have taken to the streets
almost as soon as they could walk to escape homes that were full of
bickering and discord  we have seen how little control the fathers
and mothers who could not control their own tempers had over their
children  and we have not wondered when truant officers tell us that
nine tenths of the wayward girls and hoodlum boys are the children of
divorced parents  or else  of parents who did not get along together 
now comes a great psychiatrist who asserts that he has never known
an instance of nervous breakdown in the children of happily married
parents who were brought up in a peaceful home 

read that over again  memorize it  you fathers and mothers who begin
the day by having a row at the breakfast table because the coffee isn t
just as you like it or the toast is burnt or you neglected to send up
the coal yesterday and forgot to leave the money for the milkman  you
think it is of no consequence because your wife knows you don t mean
half of what you say and she is fighting back more from force of habit
than anything else  but neither one of you gives a thought to the
children who are listening to it all  to the children who are learning
to regard you with contempt  who are having all their illusions
shattered  whom you are teaching to be bitter and misanthropic  with
no faith in anything beautiful or fine  you do not realize that you
may not only be giving them a warp in character that will bar them
from success in life  but that you may be actually dooming them to a
breakdown that will make them wrecks in body and mind 

isn t that a pretty high price to pay for the pleasure of quarreling 
and isn t it a cruelly unfair thing to force your children to settle
your score  for the sake of the children you brought into the world
and for whom you are responsible  isn t it worth while to deny yourself
the pleasure of finding fault with your husband or wife and saying all
the mean  acrimonious things you can think of  no use in saying that
you can t get along together  you can  if you want to  you get along
with other persons

the learned profession of home making


no complaint is more general possibly no belief is more prevalent among
women than that a woman of intelligence wastes her energies and her
abilities in being merely a housekeeper  following the domestic arts is
a despised calling  held in such contempt by the majority of women that
they never take the trouble to achieve success in it  and yet there is
no other occupation under the sun that requires so many and such varied
talents as does the learned profession of home making  did you ever
think what a woman must be in order to create and carry on a happy and
prosperous home 

she must be a financier  there can be no peace and pleasure in a
home where the wolf is always howling under the window and the bill
collector hammering on the door  there are  of course  a few men in
every community who are such gifted money makers that they can annex
more coin than any woman can spend  but for the great mass of ordinary 
industrious  hard working humanity the wife settles the financial
status of the family  it is her ability to handle money  her knowledge
of where to spend and where to economize  her knack of making a dollar
buy a hundred and five cents  worth and get a blue trading stamp thrown
in to boot  that is at the foundation of every prosperous home  we
don t hear anything about it  because the woman doesn t know herself
how awfully clever she is  but the majority of women in this country
are doing marvels of financiering in the way they make both ends meet
in their housekeeping allowance  and keep up appearances  that entitle
them to qualify in the rockefeller class 

she must be a general 

she must know how to command  she must know how to set all the
multitudinous wheels of household machinery in motion and be able
to keep them moving without friction  she must be able to enforce
obedience  inspire enthusiasm  plan campaigns  forestall her enemy  be
fertile in expedient and subtle in strategy  any woman who maintains a
comfortable and well ordered home  the kind of a house that we like to
visit  and who raises a nice family and marries her daughters off well
could give the commander in chief of the army points on generalship 

she must be a diplomat  the husband question  the children question and
the servant question are not to be handled without gloves  there is no
hour of the day that she is not called upon to deal with some problem
that requires the finesse of a talleyrand  she must be able  if the
white winged dove of peace is to brood over the home nest  to deal
with her husband s prejudices and circumvent them so delicately that
he will never know that he is being induced to do the thing that he
swore he would never  never do  she must assert her authority over the
growing boy with such cunning that he does not perceive that her fine
italian hand is on the check rein holding him tight and steady  she
must be able  without the girls dreaming that she does it  to insinuate
a doubt  drop a word of ridicule  imply an impossibility that will keep
her daughters out of entangling alliances and steer them toward the
reciprocally profitable permanent treaties they should make 

above all  she must be able to see most when she is apparently stone
blind  hear everything when she seems to be as deaf as the adder of the
scriptures  to be most on guard when she looks to be sleeping at her
post  and to be most chaperoning her daughters when the onlooker and
the girls themselves would swear that she was most giving them their
liberty 

she must know how to tread very softly if she keeps off the corns of
her servants  for whether a woman is agreeable or disagreeable in the
home her children are bound to stay there with her  but it is the
blessed privilege of mary ann and bridget and eke of hulda and dinah
that they can pack their trunks and go  only the very quintessence
of diplomacy renders a mistress  persona grata  to the kitchen  and
the woman who preserves friendly relations with that must understand
the alpha and omega of how to make a jolly cover the discipline of a
martinet  any woman who  when she is fifty years old  has a husband who
thinks her a solomon in petticoats  grown children who quote mother s
opinion  and a cook who has been with her five years is fitted to be
ambassador extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary at the court of
st  james s  and nothing but the stupidity of a nation that believes
that breeches and brains are synonymous terms keeps her out of the job 

she must be an artist 

it is the woman s province to create the beauty of the home  this is
true whether it is the palace of the millionaire or the three room flat
of the day laborer  every room that she arranges is a picture  just as
much as if she painted a dutch interior on canvas 

she must be a poet 

a home is not merely a place of shelter and food it is a thing no less
of the spirit and soul and a woman must put into it the passion of her
heart and the joy of creating just as truly as a poet must put them
into his song  to make a home that is beautiful  that breathes the
spirit of home  that is a haven of peace and rest to those who live in
it and that is a glimpse of paradise to the stranger who is bidden
within its gates is a profession the most exacting in which any woman
can engage and the one that calls for the greatest number of talents 
also it is the most profitable  for within it are made the men and
women who go forth to bless the world  and the wonder of wonders is
that so many just plain ordinary women are doing it  and the greatest
marvel of all is that they do not realize what a glorious thing they
are doing

a father s influence


there is no subject under the sun of which men take such a distorted
view as they do of a mother s influence  romancers have glorified it 
poets have idealized it  musicians have sung it until men have honestly
come to think that mothers have a practical monopoly of their children
and the sole duty and privilege of shaping their lives  even fathers
seem to think that fathers count for nothing and that all they are good
for is paying the bills  in the family circle they take a back seat
and let mother run the show  it is mother s day that is celebrated
with pomp and flowers and beating the cymbals  nobody notices father s
day perhaps because the first of the month is always father s day and
it comes around so often 

no one would belittle mother s influence  for good or evil it is all
powerful  but it is all powerful because father is so often too stupid
or too lazy or too careless or too much absorbed in his business to
do his duty to his children by helping to mold their characters  he
dodges his responsibility  he passes the buck to mother and salves his
conscience with a platitude about a mother s sacred influence  which
in his innermost self he recognizes for the hokum it is  for mother s
influence does not always work for righteousness  motherhood works no
miracles  bearing a baby does not put brains and wisdom in a hen minded
woman s head  it does not give a shallow woman depth  it does not make
a narrow  prejudiced woman broad and tolerant  it does not make a fool
woman wise 

yet all around us we see men who would not trust their wives  judgment
about anything else on earth  turning over to them their children s
immortal souls  they know their wives to be silly and ignorant without
vision  without the ability to see or understand anything beyond their
own little circle yet they let these morons shape their children s
lives  they let them form their children s ideals and set their
standards  they let them decide on the schools their children shall
attend  the churches they shall join  the people with whom they
associate 

yet the very men who trust their children to weak and incompetent and
unintelligent wives to rear would not dream of permitting a weak 
incompetent  unintelligent partner to run their business  they are too
well aware of the value of their personal advice and supervision and
of the need of their strong and expert hands on the wheel  men blindly
subscribe to the faith that a mother s influence is bound to be good 
especially upon her daughters  yet a moment s thought would show them
how fallacious such a belief is 

a woman can only give out what she has  she can only try to make her
daughters what she is  and unless a man wants his daughters to be just
the sort of woman their mother is  he cannot safely leave them in her
hands 

it is true that there are not many women who deliberately bring up
their girls to be immoral and start their feet on the downward path 
but there are thousands upon thousands of mothers whose influence
upon their daughters is vicious  because they inculcate in them their
own low ideals of honor and honesty  they teach them by precept and
example to evade every duty of wifehood and motherhood  and from their
very infancy up they instil into them a greed and selfishness that
wrecks the happiness of all who come in contact with them  such are
the mothers who teach their daughters how to lie and cheat  how to buy
on credit the finery they cannot afford  how to kill a man with their
extravagance  such mothers are those whose favorite maxim is that what
a husband doesn t know doesn t hurt him  such a mother is the one
who  not long ago  i heard say to her young daughter who was getting
married   don t tie yourself down with babies  go about and amuse
yourself and have a good time  and if your husband doesn t like it he
can lump it  

when a man has that kind of a wife and no man can be so afflicted
without knowing it he does a criminal thing when he leaves his girls to
their mother s influence  it is his bounden duty to use his influence
to correct hers as far as possible  little as men seem to realize it 
children nearly always listen with far more respect to what their
fathers say than they do to what their mothers say  for the child knows
intuitively that the father has had a broader experience of life than
the mother has  it knows that the father goes out into the world and
does battle with it every day and that he knows from experience the
things about which mother vaguely theorizes  it knows that father knows
the rules and how to play the game 

hence when a man really makes any attempt to develop his children s
characters he finds them as clay in his hands  ready to respond to his
slightest touch  it is only when father merely uses his influence as a
veto power that it is negligible  that a boy needs his father s hand
in directing and controlling him at the critical time of his life and
a father s wisdom to steer him along the right course is universally
recognized  but i often think that a girl needs it even more  for a
girl needs to be taught the things that life teaches a man  she needs
to be taught to be straightforward and honest and to live up to her
contracts  that she must give as well as take in life and that she must
have the courage and the grit to carry on when things are hard instead
of turning quitter and to make the best of a bad bargain  many a
divorce would have been avoided and many a home that is now broken up 
kept intact if a father s influence over his little girl had made her a
good sport  instead of mother s influence developing a yellow streak in
her 

a mother s influence is a great thing  but it needs to be backed up by
father s  that is why god gave every child two parents instead of one

the riches of poor children


the bitterest cry of poor people is that they have nothing to give
their children  the fathers and mothers who cannot buy imported finery
for their girls or sports model cars for their boys and send them off
to expensive colleges and fill their pockets with money feel that they
have come empty handed to their children and have nothing to give them 
yet the poorest man and woman who bend above a cradle have it in their
power to bestow upon their babe treasures so great that their worth
cannot be computed in dollars and cents  and that will bring the child
more pleasure and happiness in life than they could purchase with all
the wealth of the rothschilds  for there is no price tag on the most
precious things in the world  they are equally free to prince and
pauper  and more often the beggar gets them than the millionaire does 

for example  there is love a close  intimate  personal association and
tenderness and understanding  poor parents can more easily give to
their children than the wealthy can  and the child that has them is
rich beyond the dreams of avarice  and the child that has them not
is poverty stricken  although it has all else besides  the mother who
rocks her baby to sleep on her breast  whose tender arms are always
outstretched to gather her youngsters to her heart  who is never too
tired or too busy to listen to childish confidences  who surrounds
her little ones with a brooding atmosphere of affection  gives to her
children far more than does the rich mother who gives her children
nurses and governesses and pony carts and fine clothes and costly
playthings but who does not give them herself  who bestows on them
everything but the things that a child wants most and needs most mother
love and tenderness  the real mother touch 

not long ago a very rich young man figured in a disgraceful scandal 
and the one excuse offered in his defense was that his mother was dead
and his father had never given him anything except money  he had never
had any affection bestowed upon him  he had had no parental guidance 
when a little lad he had been put in a school and kept there without
even being visited by any one who loved him  without even going home
for vacations  he had been just a pitiful little millionaire waif for
whom nobody cared  the lot of such a child is infinitely worse than
that of the one whose parents are in such humble circumstances that
they can give it perhaps only the plainest of food and clothes  but who
do give it a real home that is full of close  warm family life  the
fathers and mothers to whom children are grateful and whose memories
they revere are not those who bequeath them great fortunes  but those
who leave them the memory of a love and understanding that never failed
and of a childhood that was made sweet by their parents  cherishing 

no matter how poor you are  you can give your children love and
companionship and the privilege of growing up in a peaceful and
cheerful home  and that is something that few rich parents can give
their children 

another gift that you can make your children is that of teaching them
how to read  when you do that you really don t need to do much more
for them  because you have put a magic coin in their hands that will
buy them entrance into all the doors of delight and open to them all
of the portals of romance  no one who loves to read can ever be bored
or lonely  he or she has only to open a book  and  presto  he or she
has for company all of the wit and wisdom of the ages  gay adventures 
beautiful ladies and gallant gentlemen beckon  and one has only to
follow them into realms of enchantment  all of interest  all that
informs  that thrills  that amuses  is the property of the reader 
but  reading does not always come by nature  as dogberry thought it
did  often it has to be acquired by art  but any child can be taught
to like to read  it can be given the reading habit  and no other gift
can possibly be bestowed upon it that is half so valuable or that will
bring it in such happiness or that will be such an ark of refuge to it
in times of trouble 

another gift that the poorest parents can make to their children is to
teach them how to see  most persons go through the world as blind as
bats  they never see anything that isn t directly under their noses 
and thereby they miss half of the fun and pleasure in living  there
are men and women to whom a sunset is just a phenomenon of nature that
happens every day  to whom a crowd is just a jam of people  who get
nothing out of travel but inconvenience and missing the particular kind
of breakfast food they prefer  and who loathe rain because they get
their feet wet and hate snow because it is messy  and there are other
men and women who see the glory of god in every flaming sunset  who
thrill to the finger tips at the drama they see enacted in every crowd 
to whom travel opens up a new world  to whom every rain is a symphony
and every snowstorm a poem 

which of these get the most out of life those who see or those who are
blind  those who can get pleasure out of little things or those who are
too dull and dumb to amuse themselves  those who are sensitive to every
beauty in nature  who appreciate music and art and literature  who get
the last flavor out of good cooking  or those who find everything flat
and stale and uninteresting because they have never been taught to see
the under side of things 

finally  the poorest parents can teach their children that brave
attitude toward life without which all the balance is cinders  ashes 
and dust  for disappointments and trouble come to us all  and it is
only those who have been taught how to make the best of their bad
bargains  how to laugh at misfortune and mock at fate  who achieve any
real happiness in life  so cheer up  you parents who complain that you
have nothing to give your children  you can give them love  you can
teach them to read and to see things  you can give them a brave heart 
these gifts are worth more than money  and nobody can take them away
from those who have them

a man s right to his home


it is a matter of continual wonder to me that women do not realize
how unjustly they treat their husbands about their homes  of course 
a woman s home is her castle and all that  and it is right and proper
that she should be the ruler of it  moreover  inasmuch as the average
man is in his home only a very few of his waking hours  while his wife
spends practically all of her time in it  it is more important that it
should come up to her ideal and fire her fancy than his  she should
have the right of choice in selecting the neighborhood she desires to
live in  because she has to know the people next door and look across
the street all day  and he doesn t  nor should any mere husband presume
to dictate about the number  size  and arrangements of the closets
in a house that is going to be his wife s workshop  nor should a man
interfere with his wife s taste in decoration  no matter how much it
runs to putting ruffled petticoats on the furniture and installing
forests of floor lamps  for having a home dolled up as she wants it 
fills a woman with a great and exceeding peace and joy  and no good
husband should withhold this pleasure from his wife 

but all that does not give the wife the right to monopolize the home
and use it for her sole behoof and benefit  as so many women think it
does  the man who pays the freight  the man who buys the house and who
supports it  should have a few poor  simple privileges in it which even
a wife should recognize and respect  he should at least  in all common
fairness  have the status of a star boarder in the home his money keeps
a going concern  he seldom does  however  there is not one home in a
thousand where the man of the house has even a room of his own which
he can furnish in accordance with his own taste and where he can mess
around as much as he likes 

i have known many men who tried to establish dens for themselves
in their houses  but before they got fairly settled  with their
collections of stamps or fishing rods or stuffed animals or what not
disposed around them  their wives decided that it would be just the
place for a sewing room or the nursery  three hooks in a closet and a
couple of drawers in a chiffonier are about all most men get for their
private use in their homes  and at that they generally find that their
wives and daughters have superimposed feminine fripperies over their
best suits and parked their silk stockings on top of their shirts  so
universal is the feeling among women they have a right to the entire
house that when a wife does concede an easy chair and a reading lamp
to her husband she boasts of it loudly and calls everybody s attention
to her unusual and generous gesture  whereat all marvel  and even her
husband himself puffs out his chest and feels that he is a pampered
household pet 

why women should feel that they have an exclusive right to exercise
the hospitality of the home nobody knows  but they do  if you will
observe you will see that in most homes it is the wife s family who are
perpetually billeted in the spare bedroom  while the husband s family
makes few and occasional visits  you will also observe that there are
ten men who have their mothers in law living with them to one man whose
mother resides under his roof  any wife would think it very mean in
him if her husband did not extend a cordial welcome to aunt sally and
cousin sue when they were invited for a visit and if he wasn t willing
to have her pretty young sister come and stay indefinitely in town with
them so as to have the benefits of the city  and she expects him to
register great joy when her mother telegraphs that she is coming for a
month or two 

but it is another pair of sleeves when it comes to a husband s
relatives  and there are precious few men who would dare to dump a
bunch of their kinspeople on their wives  many a man is afraid to ask
even his own mother to come to see him  the average husband would
fall dead with surprise if his wife ever intimated to him that she
considered the fact that he paid for the rent and food and light and
heat and general upkeep of the home gave him just as much right to have
his family stay with them as she had to have hers 

as to the friends who come to the house  the wife considers it her
prerogative to settle that little matter by herself and thinks that her
husband has nothing to do with it  she spreads the mat with  welcome 
on it for those she likes and slams and bolts the door in the faces
of those she doesn t fancy  and she practically never fancies her
husband s old friends  so the man who had looked forward to having
his old friends in his new home  who had dreamed of long talks with
tom by his fireside and to having bob  who was closer than a brother 
drop in at any time for pot luck finds  somehow  not only that they
do not come  but that he is afraid to ask them to come  wives are
always complaining that their husbands are not willing to stay at
home  perhaps the remedy is making the home a democracy instead of an
autocracy  if men had more rights and privileges at home they might
like staying in it better

devouring friends


 one of the greatest pests in the world is what i call the devouring
friend   said a woman the other day   she is a bloodthirsty cannibal
who gobbles you up alive  and you have no way of protecting yourself
against her  because the sacred name of friendship bars the use of all
the lethal weapons that you can use in defending yourself against other
bores and social nuisances 

 of course  the common or garden variety of devouring friend is the one
who literally eats you out of house and home  she is a self invited
guest who drops you a little note saying that she is passing through
your city or that she has to have a little dental work done or wants
to consult a doctor or do some shopping  and she does so pine to see
her darling susan and talk over old times  and will it be convenient
for her to come and spend a few days with you  all of which being
translated simply means that she desires to graft a hotel bill off you 

 anyway  she comes and camps in your spare room by the week  because
she always manages to string out the dental work or the appointments
with the doctor or the milliner  she should worry  for she is having
a good time at no expense  furthermore  by hints and insinuations she
inveigles your husband into taking her to places of amusement that you
have not felt that you could afford even when there were only two of
you to pay for  and she runs your grocery bill up to the skies because
she develops a taste for the most expensive food  and as you see her
calmly consuming the price of your new dress you know exactly how a
cornfield feels when a swarm of seven year locusts settles down on it
and goes into action 

 then there are the devouring friends who eat up your time  i am a busy
woman  i cannot afford to waste a minute  unfortunately for me  i have
a number of women friends who are rich and whose principal occupation
in life is killing time  now  these women know perfectly well that
i not only do all of my own housework but that i make my children s
clothes and that if they kill a morning for me they upset my whole
schedule and make my work pile up upon me so that my labor is twice as
hard 

 but does that keep them from interrupting me  lord  no  every time
maud has a spat with her mother in law she will drop over and spend a
whole morning giving me all the harrowing details  every time lulu s
husband gives her a new limousine i have to waste hours of my valuable
time listening to a minute description of all its splendor  every time
sallie and susie want to be sympathized with or want to brag about
their children they ruin the heart of a day s work for me by backing me
up against a wall and making me listen  and a dozen times a day i am
interrupted by women who call me up over the telephone to hold long and
fruitless conversations about nothing 

 yet there is no possible way to protect my precious time against
these friends who eat it up  they are all charming women  they like me
and i like them  i want to retain their friendship  so i cannot shut
my door in their faces when they come to see me  i can t ask them to
leave when they stay too long  i can t ring off when they call me over
the telephone  i can t even say  damn  aloud  no matter how much i
am thinking it  but i know what the cynic meant when he said that if
god would save him from his friends he would protect himself from his
enemies 

 then there are the devouring friends who swallow up all of your
home life  my husband s business is such that he has only one or two
evenings at home a week  we would like to have these to ourselves to
keep up our acquaintance or to go out on a little spree together  we
have proclaimed this fact loudly and long to our friends and we refuse
every invitation that it is possible to get out of for those two sacred
occasions  but it doesn t do a particle of good 

 being an unusually charming and entertaining individual  my husband is
regarded by my friends as a social tidbit a particularly savory  hors
d  uvre   as it were and they gobble up our evenings together without
the slightest compunction  if we won t go to them  all right  they will
come to us  so just about the time we are settling down for a real
heart to heart talk  here come the smiths to pass a pleasant evening
with us  or the joneses descend upon us and bear us off  shrieking and
protesting  to listen to their new radio  or the thompsons telephone
that they are just coming over for a game of bridge 

 and there are the other devouring friends who nibble away at our
independence like a mouse at a cheese  until some day we suddenly wake
up to the fact that our freedom is all gone  we haven t a vestige of
liberty left  we dare not give a party and leave them out  we have
to explain to them everything we do and tag meekly along in their
footsteps  and there are other devouring friends who gnaw constantly
on our sympathies by telling us all of their troubles and making us
bear their burdens for them  they are ghouls who make us feed them our
hearts to satisfy their morbid appetite for pity  perhaps there is no
way to get rid of devouring friends  but it certainly would add to
the pleasures of life if we could swat them as we do other household
pests

the secret of happiness


what is the secret of happiness  i once asked mary anderson this
question and she replied   to find out what you want of life  and then
to have the courage to take it  i wanted quiet  seclusion  home and
husband and children  the ordinary domestic life of woman   she went
on   i had the courage to leave the stage at the very height of my
career  and i have had the courage to refuse every offer to go back 
no matter how dazzling it was  i have also had the courage to stay in
my sleepy little village and refuse to let myself be drawn into the
brilliant whirl of london society  i have been happy because i knew
what i wanted  and i have been brave enough to take it in spite of all
temptations to be led into doing the things that i did not want to do  

undoubtedly this is one of the answers to the great riddle that we
are always asking and that so few solve  a great many people are
unhappy because they do not really know what they want  they have no
clear vision of the thing they are seeking  they are torn between
conflicting desires and never settle down to any one thing  and find
contentment and peace in that  you see this exemplified in the men who
are always changing from one occupation to another  and who work with
their minds on their golf and play golf with their minds on their work 
you see it in the women who are fretful and peevish wives and mothers 
complaining of the burdens of domesticity and feeling that they have
missed happiness in not following some career  and in the women who
have followed careers and who are always bemoaning their loneliness
because they have no families  yet how seldom do the disgruntled  who
lament their fate in life so loudly  have the courage to face about and
take the road that they at least believe leads to happiness  we behold
so many idle tears that we are inclined to believe there are vast
numbers of human beings who get a kind of morbid pleasure out of misery 

but what is the secret of happiness  i give four guesses at the
conundrum  the first is work  to keep so busy that we do not have
leisure to think whether we are happy or not  there is no other
pleasure comparable to the clean joy of being swallowed up in some
useful  constructive work that calls forth every power of mind
and body  your own job  that you do competently  has for you a
never failing interest  a perpetual thrill that nothing else in
the world can give  only brainless idiots are content to loaf 
intelligent  thinking men and women must keep busy in order to be happy 

my second guess is that happiness is the bird in the hand and not the
bird in the bush  if we are ever to be happy we must be happy now at
the present moment  we cannot put it off until to morrow  you are
always hearing people say that they are going to do this and that when
they get rich  that they are going to travel when they are old  they
are going to play  they are going to take up old acquaintances  they
are going to enjoy themselves five  ten  twenty years hence  but when
the time comes that they have set to be happy in  they find that they
have lost their capacity for enjoyment  those who have inched and
pinched and sweated every penny trying to accumulate a fortune have
formed such a habit of parsimony that it is agony to them to spend
money  those who have denied themselves too much have lost all desire 
those who have stayed at home too long have become such a fixture on
main street that they are lonesome and homesick everywhere else 

so the happy men and women are those who take the goods the gods
provide each hour  they make a reasonable provision against the rainy
day  and then they indulge themselves in the good clothes  the pretty
home  the comfortable car  the palatable food  the little trips that
are within their reach  they do not put off every pleasure until some
mythical  problematic day  when they will be able to live in a palace
and have a rolls royce and paris clothes and when they will be too
old and rheumatic and set in their ways to want to do anything but
sit by the fire in their own familiar chair  never was there sounder
philosophy conveyed than in the old comic opera ditty which said   i
want what i want when i want it   and if we don t take it then  it is
dust and ashes in our teeth 

happiness consists in simple things  we are always envying the rich and
great  and think how happy they must be  but we might well pity them 
for they have far more sources of sorrow than we have  beyond a modest
competence  riches are a burden  and money can become a curse that
blights every natural joy  the millionaire is cut off from the greatest
of all happiness that of knowing himself loved for himself alone  he
suspects the motive of every friend  he does not even trust the woman
he marries  and he knows his wealth to be a blight upon his children 
the real source of happiness is in enjoying simple things a gorgeous
sunset  a beautiful landscape  a clever book  a good dinner  the talk
of a friend  the unfaltering love of husband or wife  a baby s arms
around your neck  a fine son and daughter filling you with pride and
joy  these have no price tag on them  they may belong just as much to
the poor man as the rich man  indeed  they oftener do 

finally  remember the song   i want to be happy  but i can t be
happy till i make you happy  too   in unselfishness  in doing good to
others that is the real answer to the secret of how to be happy

preparedness for old age


what are you storing up for your old age  are you laying up any money
against the time when you will be old and feeble and no longer able to
work  the hour will strike for you  as it does for others  when your
earning powers will be gone  your hands will be too stiff and clumsy
to keep on with their accustomed task  your mind will be too slow to
go the pace in the fierce competition in the commercial world  if you
are an employee  you will lose your job  if you are a business man  you
will find that your trade has somehow drifted away from you  if you are
a professional man  you will be superseded by the new men whose stars
are just rising on the horizon 

nothing that you can do will alter these conditions  no miracle will
save you from the common fate of all who grow old  but if you have
saved up enough money to make you independent  it will be merely a
matter of mild regret to you  if  however  you have laid up nothing for
the rainy day that is bound to come to you  it will be a tragedy that
you will pray death to end 

for in all the world there are no people so piteous and forlorn as
those who are forced to eat the bitter bread of dependence in their old
age  and find how steep are the stairs of another man s house  wherever
they go they know themselves unwelcome  wherever they are  they feel
themselves a burden  there is no humiliation of the spirit they are not
forced to endure  their hearts are scarred all over with the stabs from
cruel and callous speeches 

in youth money is a convenience  an aid to pleasure  in age it is
an absolute necessity  for when we are old we have to buy even
consideration and politeness from those about us  this is true even in
the households of our own children  for between the father and mother
who are able to pay their own way and are the source of a never ending
flow of gifts and treats  and the father and mother who must be
supported is a great gulf fixed  it is the difference between having
the place of honor and the back seat  between being listened to with
respect and having one s opinions derided  between having one s little
peculiarities catered to as interesting characteristics and being
snubbed for one s old fashioned ways 

nor is this as unfeeling and hard boiled as it seems  the average young
couple has all it can do  in these times of the high cost of living  to
provide for itself and the children  and it makes the burden crushing
to have to add the extra weight of the support of the old people of the
families 

the fate of the dependent old is so terrible that it is a marvel that
it does not frighten every one into trying to provide against it  yet
it was recently stated in a journal of statistics that    per cent of
the men and women more than sixty years of age were dependent either
upon their children or upon public charity  don t let this misfortune
befall you  guard against it  begin systematic saving while you are
young  so that when you are old you will at least have the comfort of
being independent 

are you laying up affection for your old age  most of us have a curious
and na ve belief in what we call  natural affection   we befool
ourselves into thinking that people must love us because they stand in
a certain relationship to us and because there are blood ties between
us  never was there a more fallacious theory  there is  to be sure 
the mother s passion for the child she has borne and the instinctive
clinging of the child to its mother while it is young and helpless  but
that is all  it doesn t follow as a matter of course that grown up men
and women love their parents just because they are their parents  as a
matter of fact  they don t  unless the father and mother have won their
love by years of tenderness and understanding and sympathy  you can t
be hard and tyrannical and selfish and stingy with your children and
expect them to love you because it is their duty to do so  if you want
your children to love you when you are old  you have to begin winning
their hearts when they are in the cradle 

have you laid up a good supply of friendship for your old age  no
complaint is heard more often from the old than that they are lonely 
few come to see them  they are seldom asked out  no one sends them
flowers when they are sick  they are neglected and they crave the
little attentions that we all like and yearn for the society of their
fellow creatures  now  when old people are lonely  it is always their
own fault  it is because they have neglected to lay up any friendships
for the sere and yellow days when they have no longer the power to
attract people to them 

they have gone their selfish way through life  sufficient unto
themselves in their youth  they have never held out a helping hand to
those in need  they have never wept with those who wept and rejoiced
with those who rejoiced  they have not bothered to write notes of
condolence or congratulation  they have never visited the sick and
afflicted  they have never spent an hour listening to an old person s
garrulous talk  and so  when they get old  they are repaid in the same
coin 

are you laying up any mental riches for your old age  i know an old
lady so feeble that she cannot stir from her chair  and whose eyes have
failed so that she cannot tell day from night  and who is so deaf that
she cannot be read to  but who passes her days delightfully reciting
to herself whole cantos of scott and byron and recalling word for word
chapters of dickens and thackeray and miss austen  her mind to her a
kingdom is  in which she finds entertainment and amusement  will you be
amused or bored when you are in your nineties and have nothing but your
own society  i know another woman  middle aged  who is deliberately
laying up a treasure of memories of travel to solace her in her old
age  she will never know a dull moment  for she will have something to
think about besides her rheumatism and her diet when she sits alone in
the twilight of life 

old age comes to us all  don t let it find you empty handed or
empty minded  thus shall you make it a time of happiness instead of
torment
