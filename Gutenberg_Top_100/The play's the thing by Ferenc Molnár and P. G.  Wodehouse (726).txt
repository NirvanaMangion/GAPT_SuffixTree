on a saturday in summer act i a m act ii a m act iii p m the play s the thing act one as the curtain rises a distant orchestra is heard playing leoncavallo s mattinata the stage is almost dark the only light comes through two large french windows at the back through them we see the moonlit mediterranean far below the vague outlines of the precipitous coast twinkling lights along quays and esplanades and here and there the faint glow from some lighted window a lighthouse blinks intermittently in the far distance within the dark room three darker shadows loom against the moonlit windows the lighted ends of three cigarettes prick the blackness there is a long pause it is almost embarrassingly long just before one wonders if anything is ever going to happen a man s voice breaks the silence the man s voice when you stop talking sandor for sixty consecutive seconds there s something wrong one of the shadowy forms is seen to rise and cross to the right wall we hear the click of an electric switch and instantly the stage is flooded with the warm glow of several electric sconces and candelabra lamps the light reveals a room beautifully furnished in italian renaissance at the back one shallow step leads up to a raised portion which runs the whole width of the room behind it are the french windows now closed with a balcony beyond them to the right a short flight of steps leads to a landing and a door to a bedroom suite to the left one step leads up to a door to the hall and the remainder of the castle occupying the right wall of the lower portion of the room is a great fireplace with a corbelled chimney a long table stands near it at the left is a grand piano below the piano in the left wall is a door to another bedroom all these doors are closed above the piano toward the center is a small stand with a telephone on it there are comfortable chairs here and there the ceiling is beamed and carved the whole room reflects wealth and beauty the speaker who has just lighted the room is a large and portly man of middle age his name is mansky he is in a dinner jacket as are his two companions sandor turai seated in the center and albert adam near the piano turai is also middle aged but younger looking and less portly than mansky a glance shows him to be a man of consequence and dynamic personality he is wearing a monocle albert adam is a dreamy handsome boy just over the threshold of manhood the distant orchestra has stopped playing mansky reseats himself to the right of turai and speaks again what s on your mind sandor turai i was just thinking how extraordinarily difficult it is to begin a play the eternal problem of how to introduce your principal characters adam i suppose it must be hard turai it is devilish hard up goes the curtain there is a hush all over the theatre people come on the stage then what it s an eternity sometimes as much as a quarter of an hour before the audience finds out who s who and what they are all up to mansky i never saw such a fellow can t you forget the theatre for a single minute turai no that s why i m such a great dramatist mansky you can t be happy for half an hour unless you re talking shop life isn t all theatre turai yes it is if you write plays you know what alphonse daudet says in his memoirs when he stood by his father s death bed all he could think of was what a wonderful scene it would make for the stage mansky it s silly to let your job become an obsession turai well that s the theatre either you master it or it masters you and of all the brain racking things in the world beginning a play is the worst that s where your technique comes in my boy take this scene here for instance we three curtain goes up on three ordinary men in ordinary dinner jackets how is anybody to know even that this room we re sitting in is a room in a castle and how are they to know who we are if this were a play we would have to start jabbering about a lot of thoroughly uninteresting things until the audience gradually found out who we were mansky well why not turai think how much simpler it would be if we were to cut out all that stuff and just introduce ourselves he rises and addresses the audience ladies and gentlemen good evening we three arrived to night to spend a couple of weeks at this castle we ve just left the dining room where we did ourselves remarkably well with some excellent champagne my name is sandor turai i am a playwright i have been a playwright for thirty years i make a very good thing of it i bow and step back leaving the stage to you turai steps back and mansky steps forward and addresses the audience mansky ladies and gentlemen my name is mansky i too am a playwright and this gentleman s life long collaborator we are probably the best known firm in the business turai come to mansky and turai for all comedies farces and operettas satisfaction guaranteed mansky i too make a very good thing out of it turai which brings us mansky to the remaining member of the trio they indicate adam who rises and addresses the audience in similar fashion but with more diffidence and none of their assurance adam the last and least i ladies and gentlemen am albert adam i am twenty five years old and i compose music turai very good music too adam i have done the score for the latest operetta by these two kind gentlemen my first effort they discovered me they got me invited to this castle regardless of expense they bought me a complete wardrobe without them i am a complete nonentity i have no parents no reputation and no money turai but you re young mansky and gifted adam and in love with the prima donna turai don t bother to tell them that an audience takes it for granted that the young composer is in love with the prima donna it s tradition adam thank heaven turai again addressing the audience isn t that the simplest way to begin a play mansky very crude if that were all there was to it any fool could write plays turai a great many do but you see how absurdly easy it is all you have to do is mansky all right all right all right for heaven s sake stop talking shop i ve had enough save it for to morrow turai perhaps you re right yes it s a treat to get a couple of hours off for a change wonderful that trip in the car italy and here we are free at last from the stuffy world of behind the scenes out of the reach of thin skinned actors and thick skinned managers all the year i ve looked forward to these two weeks a princely host and a house full of smart people just what men like ourselves need to inspire us and mark this my friends nothing to worry about for our job is done he goes to the window opens it steps on to the balcony and speaks from there the operetta is finished and off our minds and moreover it is summer the weather is perfect the night is gorgeous the sea is the sea and the dinner was good he comes back into the room yes we must remember it it s been a great day august the th mansky friday turai what of it mansky i wish it wasn t turai don t be such an old woman mansky no one ought to arrive anywhere on a friday adam dreamily what difference does it make friday saturday sunday spring summer autumn winter life s always wonderful turai crosses to adam my unlucky day is tuesday among other things to mansky you were born on a tuesday mansky well look at it for yourself here s to day s little bag of bad luck san martino mid day violent thunderstorm followed by blow out set us back an hour fiero early afternoon ran over dog surrounded by angry multitude had to scatter money to every one in sight to keep from getting mobbed more delay and we reach here at ten instead of eight friday and when we arrive who is out our princely host who else everybody all gone off on a picnic friday and the beautiful the one and only the most vitally important member of the whole house party our adorable prima donna where is she also off on a picnic is she expected home to night no when is she expected no one knows friday turai oh she ll be back mansky well that won t spoil friday s record because it s saturday now adam and i ve got to wait a whole night before i see her it s cruel mansky just friday turai well now listen to me i ll give you my version of the day s proceedings friday san martino mid day capital luncheon including some really drinkable coffee during the meal a few passing drops of rain result perfect roads no dust fiero early afternoon injured a dog and for a while it looked as though the populace were about to injure us but our friday good luck held the dog made a miraculous recovery and when last seen was sitting up and taking nourishment and a few insignificant coins judiciously distributed made the populace our friends for life to resume we arrived here some hours late but what a bit of luck that was everybody away nobody in the house to expect tired men to make conversation furthermore we dine on a picturesque terrace of a wonderful old italian castle and are given as fine a curried chicken as i ever tasted mansky i loathe curry turai and in conclusion let me tell you the crowning piece of good fortune of this magical friday he indicates the door to the bedroom at left the next room to this is ilona s adam what turai yes through that door is the room of the beautiful the one and only and having a pull with the butler i managed to get this suite for ourselves there s luck for you mansky for him turai and for us we profit indirectly when a composer is happy he writes song hits when a prima donna is happy she stops singing off the key and the librettists gather royalties from the resulting triumph mansky sordid brute you ve no poetry in your soul turai but i have a balance in my bank much more satisfactory as for ilona being away that s good luck too think of the pleasant surprise she will get it is night the little darling comes home from her picnic all unsuspecting she goes to her little room sinks upon her little bed mansky why on earth must everything always be so little turai why not mansky damned sentimentalism i know the house well she has a huge room and an enormous bed turai immaterial quite immaterial the point is that she comes home all unsuspecting she doesn t know we re here adam who has been sitting dreamily at the piano begins playing softly she doesn t know we ve brought the finished operetta with us she doesn t know i m going to sing her the waltz song from act two mansky god help her turai the world famous waltz mansky looks at him skeptically at least it s not world famous yet but it s bound to become so anyway the ravishing theme waltz upon which this infant genius has poured out all the treasure of his love bewitched soul adam stops playing mansky be quiet never praise a composer it unsettles him rises looks at watch do you know it s after three i have been thinking and i ve got an idea turai beginner s luck mansky let s go to bed you can do any singing you want to morrow if they re not home yet it means they re staying out all night i know the ways of this house we ve been up since five and i m all in three hundred miles are chasing themselves through my head as for your infant genius with the love bewitched soul he s asleep already adam who has been nodding over the piano awakens with a start i m not turai i ve no objection to postponing the surprise party suppose we wake her with the waltz adam if only she doesn t find out before turai that s all right i particularly told my friend the butler that nobody must know of our arrival till to morrow morning the butler is a very important man he practically runs this house adam rising then i m going to take a bath turai i don t follow your logic what has the importance of the butler to do with taking baths adam i hate logic starts toward the door at right but stops to gaze out of the window turai do you really intend to bathe at this hour adam yes turai in the sea adam stands by balcony door no in the tub the sound of a distant orchestra is heard playing toselli s serenade when you re tired and sleepy and looking forward to something particularly nice it s wonderful to lie in luke warm water with your eyes closed turai hear hear sits in large armchair well do as you please infant when an artist is working he must pamper himself to mansky you have to humor these composers did you ever know his grandmother mansky i had not that pleasure turai adam comes down the steps and sits down again she brought him up when his parents died she was about so high the littlest old woman i ever saw in my life adam tiny wasn t she turai and the very opposite of this dreamy boy always hustling always on the go it s her fault that our young friend here has always remained such an unsophisticated babe she not only mothered him she smothered him with her love she was like a little witch in a fairy tale guarding hidden treasure i ll never forget the day she brought him to me for the first time adam my goodness i was scared that day turai so was i this little half portion of a woman fixed me with blazing eyes and fairly hissed this boy is a genius you must hear his work pensively his mother was a gentle beautiful woman adam i hardly remember her turai i can see her very clearly still he rises and goes to adam whom he pats affectionately on the shoulder ah well you re going to escape the struggles most young artists have before they reach the top no wasting of time and brain and nerve energy for you you ve got a very clever man behind you pushing you on music stops mansky significantly two clever men turai two laughs ah yes of course two to adam so run away and have your bath and sleep and dream and love and enjoy this beautiful world and all that there is in it happiness will make your music all the sweeter mansky you ought to be ashamed of yourself encouraging him to be a dreamer he should be learning by this time that life isn t all music and roses and happiness turai why be in such a hurry to teach him that mansky i m not in a hurry turai then why must he be in a hurry to learn it adam who has run up the steps at right pauses at the door this is my room eh turai whose else could it be have you forgotten who is sleeping or about to be sleeping on the other side of that wall he indicates the left wall adam i should say i haven t turai it s rather a good situation lovers and separated by a wall like pyramus and thisbe what is that speech of pyramus s speaking to the left wall and thou oh wall oh sweet oh lovely wall oh wicked wall through whom i see no bliss mansky impatiently shop again always shop adam and what about you two turai we re all right our room is on the other side of yours adam are you sharing a room turai we have to real collaborators never separate for a moment or the most priceless ideas might be lost forever besides i talk in my sleep i m told that s when i say some of my best things mansky is a light sleeper and he wakes up and jots them down mansky rises indignantly adam i think i m going to like this place well gentlemen before i go one last word i am very fond of both of you i am finding life very beautiful and i am very happy adam goes out once again the distant orchestra is heard this time playing the brise argentine turai which startling utterance seems to call for a glass of very old brandy he crosses to the bell rope on left wall and pulls it mansky make it two turai it s nice to see the boy so happy now i m on the shady side of fifty i find myself full of parental affection and nobody to lavish it on reflectively yes his mother was a gentle beautiful woman he goes up to window and looks down the cliff they re still dancing down there on the hotel terrace with spot lights on the dancers with that dark blue sky in the background and the coloured lights on the water that wouldn t make a bad setting for a first act finale mansky who has just taken a cigarette from his case snaps it shut with irritation yes i m coming to think the boy s right and life is beautiful mansky sandor turai yes mansky i didn t like to tell you before though it really belongs to friday too turai tell me what mansky sits on bench with the unconscious relish of the confirmed pessimist something rather unpleasant a little piece of news rather unpleasant the music has stopped turai who has been at the window turns toward mansky turai you re a queer chap just when a man s feeling happy for five minutes you have to come along and take the joy out of life mansky it concerns you too it s rather unpleasant turai going to mansky speaks ironically well come on old friend ruin my evening what is it mansky i was looking in the visitors book downstairs and i saw a certain name puffs cigarette yes it s rather unpleasant turai don t sit there making my flesh creep what name did you see in the visitors book mansky almady turai the actor mansky yes turai he s here mansky he is turai h m this is as you say rather unpleasant mansky you realize what this means turai it means that you re thoroughly happy mansky not at all i may be a pessimist but unfortunately i m a tender hearted pessimist when i am proved right i do not enjoy the fact the fact is that mr almady is here turai but how why he hasn t been invited here for ten years i always understood he spent his summers with his wife and children at lake balaton mansky i suppose he fished for an invitation he probably had his reasons turai does our young friend know anything about that business mansky he hasn t an inkling of the part mr almady has played in his fianc e s life turai well hang it all it wasn t so much of a part what does it amount to when she was starting on the stage he gave her lessons in voice production and then well it was just the usual business the romantic leading actor and the little pupil the sort of thing that lasts a couple of months at the outside and besides it was all over and done with long ago mansky apparently it is not over and done with turai rot because by pure chance he happens to be in the same house mansky it isn t pure chance it s impure intention use your intelligence man ilona was almady s discovery he taught her all she knows turai that s a thing of the past ilona s intelligent she s in love and she s engaged to be married and you know how whole heartedly how passionately an actress can be engaged when she is engaged to be married i m bound to say i m not remarkably enthusiastic about this match but if it makes the boy happy that s the main thing my dear chap you re crazy she wouldn t be such a fool with a worn out elderly actor a father of a family with four children she s got too much sense mansky i never said a word about that i merely said i had seen his name in the visitors book that means he is staying here is that pleasant no it is unpleasant that was all i said i now say something more we ought to have wired ilona that we were coming to night turai i admit it you re right again so be happy never surprise a woman always wire her in plenty of time on several occasions in a longish life i have prepared a joyful surprise for a woman and every time i was the one surprised the telegraph was invented for no other purpose than that women should not get surprises there is a knock at the door left come in a footman enters from the hall he is an elderly man in blue livery what do you want footman what do you want sir you rang sir turai oh yes cognac footman any particular brand sir turai to mansky do me a favor old man and go up and keep albert talking for a few minutes i want to have a few words with this fellow mansky don t drink both the brandies mansky goes out through door at right turai what s your name footman mine sir turai yes yours

to bedroom dwornitschek yes sir turai has she been gone long dwornitschek i have not seen her come in sir turai did you see her go out dwornitschek yes sir they left at six o clock this afternoon turai they who dwornitschek the entire house party sir including the master they were going to san pietro i think sir turai is that far dwornitschek the yacht would take them there in about an hour and a half twenty six persons in all sir supper served on board a nice cold collation sir turai when do you expect them back dwornitschek well sir they took a considerable quantity of liquor with them turai the question i asked was when do you expect them back dwornitschek that is the question i m answering sir hardly before to morrow morning at the earliest turai i see who s in the party dwornitschek the core or center of it if i may use the expression sir turai certainly you may use the expression it s a beautiful expression dwornitschek thank you sir the core or center of it is an american family distant relatives of the master every time a holiday comes around they insist on a picnic turai what holiday is to day dwornitschek i don t know sir they have two every week here they always go off at night in the big yacht they re quite wild about the young lady she sings for them on the yacht with the gypsy band turai oh they have gypsies too dwornitschek yes sir four pieces from the hotel but they re not much good no a gypsy s not at his best sir on the water gypsies need solid ground turai solid ground yes of course well passing over the subject of gypsies for a moment if

will that be all sir turai yes that will be all dwornitschek excuse me sir but you said that i would find out later on turai why i began by asking you all those personal questions dwornitschek exactly sir turai quite simple it s a little matter of psychology when you want a man to speak the truth begin by making him tell you all about himself it gives him a feeling of responsibility and makes him afraid to lie later on that s from a detective play by mansky and turai you can take the tip as some slight return for your trouble dwornitschek thank you very much sir turai don t mention it dwornitschek and which shall i bring you sir turai which what which dwornitschek which brand of cognac turai which brands have you dwornitschek all the best brands sir hennessey three star martel

young lady coming back now they listen from the adjoining room at the left a soprano voice is heard singing casually but clearly a well known aria from an operetta yes sir that s the young lady all

you she is she s in her room do be quick i ve ordered champagne here i ll help you dress the door at the right is closed from the outside from inside the adjoining room on the left the singing continues until interrupted by almady s voice raised in protest almady s voice what do you mean by this singing i believe you re doing it just to annoy me she trills a few notes you re trying to torture me ilona s voice well it s pretty cool to come walking into my bedroom at this hour almady s voice i came with you ilona s voice now listen everything s over and ended i ve put you out of my life forever i m engaged to be married and i intend to be a good little wife you ve no right to behave like this almady s voice no right i who made you i with whom you have lived so many hours of

in the ante room take the whole bottle if you want to but go pause shouting look on the sideboard and stay where you are till i ve got my nightie on don t come in and don t look there is a silence during which the door right is opened and turai adam and mansky tiptoe in like three mischievous boys they speak in whispers as they cross to the door to ilona s bedroom turai hush she s gone to bed adam do you think she s asleep already turai i doubt it come on faces to the wall as close as you can get they group themselves in a row as near the wall as the furniture will permit turai whispers ready now ilona ilona ilona take the time from me raises his hand like a conductor at the same moment almady s voice is heard almady s voice i worship you i adore you the three are riveted where they stand transfixed with amazement ilona s voice are you starting all over again almady s voice yes i am all over again i love you as the church steeple loves the cloud that settles above it and floats away with the first passing breeze i can t go on living without you not a week not a day not an hour the three men turn simultaneously ilona s voice contemptuously just words almady s voice it s the truth i m crazy about you and you you ve used me up and squeezed me like a lemon and now you want to throw me away ilona s voice i don t want to throw you away silly where s the sense in raving like this oh come on then come here and let me kiss your beautiful classic brow adam she said did you hear what she said almady s voice that s not a kiss that s a tip nothing but a paltry tip mansky sinks into chair ilona s voice don t shout like that almady s voice i will shout i m a squeezed lemon that s what i am sobs a lemon the whole world shall know that i m a lemon ilona s voice get off your knees and oh please do stop crying i can t bear it you know how fond i am of you turai and mansky clap their hands to their heads adam collapses on the piano stool almady s voice those nights of love those flaming wonderful nights have you forgotten them so completely adam looking up that s almady mansky you can t be sure turai turns to mansky don t be an ass don t try to deceive a musician about a voice there s no use talking the thing s a tragedy and we ve got to face it mansky friday ilona s voice stop control yourself almady s voice you ask me to control myself when i look at that at that perfect shape the rose flush of that skin ilona s voice hands off almady s voice my god how round it is how smooth how velvety and how fragrant a pause ilona s voice don t bite almady s voice i must i am so hungry turai to adam and patting him on the shoulder i think you had better go old man go and turn in in our room adam bitterly and i thought she was a madonna holding her in his arms stroking rising in sudden fury and rushing to the door god i could kill him turai restraining him steady old man steady adam covers his ears with his hands almady s voice ah well i see i am nothing to you any more ilona s voice oh for goodness sake i swear that no man has ever meant so much to me as you from the top of your head to the soles of your feet you are a man who should know that better than i turai come come my boy let s get out of this mansky goes to adam come on old chap you re going to sleep in our room turai and mansky lead him to stairway adam sleep he goes out at right turai and mansky are on the landing ilona s voice oh don t look so pathetic well come here kiss me mansky i was right we ought to have sent a telegram he goes out at right turai comes down to table lights a cigarette and sits on edge of table almady s voice i want you to remember that kiss forever ilona s voice it was your old kiss sweet and burning like hot punch but do be a dear and go away now it was mad of you to come here if my fianc ever hears of this i ll kill myself oh damn my idiotic sentimentality for getting me into this mess you must leave here to morrow on the first train he ll be here any day now turai shifts uneasily every day i ve been expecting a telegram turai groans get out i tell you get out almady s voice if you insist dear heart so be it your word is law i am going to bed now farewell dear heart but grant me one last kiss turai to himself damn all fools who don t know when they ve had enough ilona s voice go now almady s voice so be it good night dear heart ilona s voice good night you baby silence a door is heard closing turai to himself at last good night dear heart after a moment he sits down in armchair pause mansky re enters mansky with a gesture of inquiry toward ilona s room this silence what does it mean turai this silence is a highly moral silence the baritone hero has departed and the fair heroine has deposited herself in bed mansky after depositing us in the worst mess in my whole experience wasn t it awful turai awful mansky smooth round fragrant and he wanted to bi oh my god he sits turai ten minutes ago we were three happy men that poor boy how is he mansky i got him to bed poor little pyramus a jolly wall that isn t it church steeple lemon the damned fool turai i can t look him in the face that little old grandmother of his she d let me have it with her broomstick if she were here mansky it s certainly the most appalling mess you got it through your pull with the butler marvelous luck pyramus and thisbe oh sweet wall well i hope you re satisfied turai oh go to the devil mansky i don t want to be unkind but whichever way you look at it you re to blame for this catastrophe why the deuce was it necessary to put the boy next door to his lady love friendship is friendship but there are limits turai i was merely trying to be sympathetic and helpful i meant well mansky never mean well it s fatal see what s happened as a result bride gone love gone waltz gone operetta gone all a total loss on the other hand the dog didn t die and the coffee was good well friday has certainly made a nice clean efficient job of it this time turai i m only thinking about that boy mansky and i m also thinking about our operetta the lady kissed the lemon s classic brow after this can you see her playing the part turai do stop jabbering about that side of it i m only interested in the boy did he say anything mansky plenty i wish i hadn t heard it turai what did he say mansky one of his remarks was i ll tear up the score and kill ilona the round and fragrant one and the problem that presents itself to me is this if he tears up his music and kills the prima donna what sort of a first night shall we have turai thinks a moment then with emphasis we ll have a first night i promise you that mansky what after all this turai yes after all this don t worry we ll have a first night all right mansky with that music turai with that music and that composer and that prima donna and i ll tell you some other things we ll have a hit a wedding and a happy ending mansky well of all the optimists it s just a suggestion but wouldn t it be a good idea if you were to mention just what you propose to do this is where sandor turai famous for his happy endings had better try to surpass himself turns toward stairs get busy my play writing genius and let s see how good you are turai one can but do one s best mansky goes out at right a clock in the hall is heard to strike four turai takes a blank sheet of music from the piano he paces up and down in deep thought occasionally glancing toward ilona s room he jots down a few words mansky re enters well how is he mansky lying in bed staring at the ceiling that s bad he didn t even answer my question turai what did you ask him mansky i said plaintively feeling better now turai what did you expect him to answer to a damn fool question like that mansky well have you solved the problem turai if i have i m not going to tell you you ve ruined enough good ideas of mine already with your collaboration this time i mean to work alone without a partner goes to table sits on bench all i ask of you is a little information there are a few facts i require mansky huffily that s all i m good for is it turai that s all where are almady s wife and family now mansky at lake balaton i believe turai lake

god mrs a szabo what s her address mansky elizabeth avenue fured turai would she be there now mansky petulantly oh god how should i know but listen points to ilona s room my own humble suggestion would be to wake her up now and have a little chat turai what about mansky starting across i ll rout her out goes left turai excitedly for heaven s sake no the only thing a woman can do is deny everything what could she deny could she unsay those words of hers gloss over that mad sensual outburst explain her half hearted resistance of course she might point out that it was nice of her to forbid the man to bite no i can t quite see where denials come in mansky women have lots of other tricks falling on their knees fainting bursting into tears laughing hysterically or just going rigid all over turai that might be good enough for you or me when you re a middle aged dramatist you welcome a chance to do the noble forgiving business it s good theatre but that boy in there is twenty five and he isn t a dramatist so think again mansky collapsing hopelessly in armchair then there s no solution to the problem turai there s a solution to everything one has only to find it mansky by jove rather a good line that turai not bad jot it down mansky does so on his cuff and now the most important thing is be very tactful and understanding with the boy sit by his bed till he falls asleep mansky he won t sleep to night turai give him something to make him he must have sleep to morrow s going to be a big day one false move and he will be the center of a record scandal it would break his heart and on his peace of mind depends mansky our success capacity business a year s run turai beastly words mansky and yet only yesterday how beautiful they sounded turai go away i ll take on this job rises leave everything to me and base your confidence on past experience which shows the moment you stop trying to help me i can solve anything mansky bows stiffly and turns toward stairs thank

turai three more than sufficient dwornitschek leaves one glass on the tray before turai he places the other three on the table there is a pause turai stares at him dwornitschek something in the expression of your eye sir tells me that you are trying to remember my name turai quite right what is it dwornitschek dwornitschek sir turai still dwornitschek well well all right dwornitschek you can

ilona s room sighs and then goes out at left as the curtain falls act two as the curtain rises a clock in the hall is heard to strike six golden sunlight pours in the windows the mediterranean is as blue as tradition has painted it sandor turai now jauntily attired in white flannels is seated in the armchair at the center with the loose leaves of a manuscript before him as the clock stops striking the door at left to the hall is opened by dwornitschek who comes down to turai bringing a newspaper on a salver dwornitschek is followed by two lackeys in livery each carrying an enormous silver tray piled high with turai s breakfast during the dialogue that follows the lackeys place the breakfast upon the long table at the right this done one of them stands at attention while the other goes up to the window opens it steps out on the balcony and lowers an awning which shuts off some of the now too brilliant sunlight dwornitschek good morning sir turai good morning what s this dwornitschek morning paper sir turai you ve read it of course dwornitschek oh yes sir turai anything about me in it dwornitschek no sir turai then take it away dwornitschek gives salver with the

sir many people do i had an aunt turai suppose we don t talk about your aunt just for the moment dwornitschek very good sir turai later on perhaps dwornitschek at any time that suits you sir turai you must make allowances for the artistic temperament when i have been sitting up all night writing i somehow don t feel in the vein for discussing other people s aunts you understand don t you dwornitschek i quite understand sir turai has risen and crossed to the table upon which he has put the manuscript he now goes round to the right side where his place is set he examines the breakfast with evident satisfaction he lifts the covers from several silver dishes looks at their contents with pleasure and smiles at dwornitschek with approval turai you re really a wonderful fellow how on earth did you manage not to forget anything dwornitschek it was a labour of love sir my heart is in that breakfast turai sitting down your heart too after he has taken a sip of tea ah that puts new life into a man dwornitschek you must have had very little sleep sir turai not much dwornitschek i hadn t any turai yes i remember you told me you were essentially a hibernating animal dwornitschek nobody else is stirring as yet this is the time when i sometimes manage to lie down myself for a few moments turai then you will get some sleep after all dwornitschek just forty winks sir that s the advantage of being by the sea gentlemen stay in bed till noon very different from the mountains turai who throughout this dialogue is eating and drinking with relish and satisfaction they get up early in the mountains eh dwornitschek at about five or four thirty they like to go climbing but there s always a bright side sir they go to bed at nine turai you know you re broadening my mind tremendously every time i see you i learn something new dwornitschek if it s not a liberty sir i should like to say something turai i ll bet it s something good go on dwornitschek you ought to take more care of your health sir you don t get enough sleep turai i don t dwornitschek and you smoke too much sir i found at least fifty cigarette butts in the ashtray in the library turai wrong thirty seven dwornitschek too many sir turai what s your daily allowance dwornitschek fifteen sir turai you ll live to be a hundred dwornitschek thank you is that a medical opinion sir turai no just a hope this weary world needs men like you dwornitschek no no sir like you turai well shall we say like both of us dwornitschek would it be a liberty sir if i expressed the opinion that you have a heart of gold turai not at all thank you very much dwornitschek thank you sir turai no no thank you dwornitschek it s the way you take an interest that touches a man sir i wish there was something i could do for you turai at the moment i think the best thing you can do for me is to leave me alone and if anyone asks for me tell them i m sleeping and must not be disturbed understand dwornitschek oh yes indeed sir dwornitschek starts to exit turai stops him turai pantomimes wait a minute i must remember your name he registers despair dwornitschek smiles indulgently and whispers dwornitschek turai thank you dwornitschek thank you sir he goes out at the left to hall turai rises listens at staircase then goes to the telephone and takes up the receiver turai hello will you give me miss ilona szabo s room he waits telephone bell rings loudly in the room at the left after a pause it rings again ilona s voice sleepily yes turai speaks into telephone very mildly hello ilona s voice hello turai softly hello ilona s voice who s that turai the unfeeling brute who has aroused you from your slumber is known to the police as sandor turai ilona s voice changing in a flash delighted sandor dear old sandor turai

better now ilona s voice yes i can hear beautifully now turai good ilona s voice i ll be right in turai goes back to the telephone and hangs up the receiver there is a short pause then the door at left to bedroom is thrown open and ilona szabo enters she is an extraordinarily beautiful blonde young woman having just got out of bed and slipped a flimsy alluring negligee over her nightie she is somewhat dishevelled her golden hair is awry moreover she is at the moment more than anxious her apprehension and fright are close to panic sandor what is it i feel something terrible has happened what s the matter when did you get here turai calmly sit down my dear you and i have got to do some quick talking ilona but what s happened for heaven s sake tell me turai sit down ilona why turai because if you don t sit down now you ll sit down later on when you hear what i ve got to say and you ll sit down hard better do it gracefully while you can he pushes her gently into the armchair at center ilona i don t understand turai you will my dear little ilona in spite of the fact that you are engaged to my young friend adam you are still carrying on an affair with mr almady ilona with indignation it s an outrageous lie turai good i thought you were going to say it was none of my business ilona i couldn t say that because you re albert s guardian guide philosopher and friend and god knows what else and you re a friend of mine and write plays for me so i simply say that it s a lie turai i m glad you do because it s an observation which i can answer i ve been in this room since last night and the walls in this new wing are as thin as paper ilona looks at walls as the truth dawns upon her she is horrified good god turai lemon ilona hides her face lemon church steeple well dear ilona suppose we talk this over something s got to be done and done quickly ilona if you heard you heard what i said too turai every word ilona then you know that i told him to get out and he s getting out to day at twelve o clock so if you don t say anything and of course you won t turai not quite so fast please if the thing were as simple as that you would never have known from me that i had overheard you i regret to say matters are much more unpleasant ilona sinking back in chair my god you don t mean turai i see you ve guessed ilona did did i can t say it turai i will say it for you yes the boy did hear it too ilona looks at turai god he s here then turai he is here ilona where turai sh he s up in mansky s room asleep and last night he was in this room awake ilona rises goes toward her room i ll take veronal all there is in my bottle turai that s not enough ilona turns ten ounces turai i was not referring to the veronal i mean suicide is no solution ilona there isn t any solution that i could survive dramatically there are only two things i can possibly do kill myself or deny the whole story turai deny the whole story do you suppose if it were just a question of telling lies i would have troubled you i d have told them myself long ago ilona then we come back to the veronal turai exactly we come back to the veronal and find it safely tucked away in its bottle ilona well what do you suggest turai i have my plan and all i ask of you is not to hinder it ilona almost crying you know i worship albert if anybody knows that you do i ve been a different woman since i met him he looks on me as a saint turai gives her a quick ironic glance and he s right i have turned into a saint since i began to love him it was the only thing i wanted to do in life to keep straight for his sake i was so happy she sinks into armchair crying i love him so turai and yet you can t be true to him ilona indignantly you ve no right to say that it was nothing but my damned sentimentality you know very well that affair with that beast almady didn t last a couple of months first he gave me breathing lessons and taught me how to throw my voice turai with a significant glance yes he taught you that all right ilona i m just a victim of my kind heart i thought i was rid of him but he got himself invited here and he s always bursting into tears a woman hates to see a man cry he stuck to me like a leech rises and stalks about hysterically but why on earth would i want to start in with him again i give you my word sandor that last night was simply like the last dying vibrations of a high note turai you d have done better to stop vibrating a little earlier still there it is what we ve got to do now is get you out of the mess ilona runs across to turai and throws herself on her knees clasping him beseechingly sandor sandor darling do you really think you can turai yes i can but don t think i m doing it for your sake my dear not for the sake of your beautiful eyes you deserve to be drawn and quartered i m doing it for that poor decent boy who still retains a few ideals in this unpleasant world yes my dear ilona i think i must ask you to be a little ashamed of yourself ilona bitterly don t worry rises i am what can i do turai goes to telephone i am just going to tell you and you won t enjoy it still good medicine s rarely pleasant picks up receiver hello to ilona what s the number of almady s room ilona apprehensively what do you want with him turai into the telephone give me mr almady s room please pause never mind about all that my good man i don t care what instructions he left call him and go on ringing till he answers it s a matter of life and death ilona what are you doing turai in telephone mr almady yes yes i know you gave instructions will you please be quiet for a moment this is sandor turai speaking here in the new wing last night by car good morning you were awake already capital would you mind coming here at once room number four yes i mean now right away yes matter of life and death was what i said but i made a slight error i should have said a matter of death yes yes this very minute right he hangs up the receiver ilona starts to go where are you off to ilona if almady is coming here turai you will kindly stay just where you were ilona looking toward albert s bedroom at right crying he looked on me as a saint he thought i was everything that was fine and pure he called me his madonna turai you should have thought of that a long time ago ilona tell me what did albert say turai i wouldn t ask that if i were you ilona god what was the plan you said you had can t you speak turai patience ilona it s too cruel just because i hate hurting people s feelings she breaks off as a knock sounds on the door left to hall turai come in almady who enters is also in a state of nervous apprehension he is attired in elaborate not to say loud house pajamas a tall and but recently handsome man now well into middle age almady is first last and always the actor he dramatizes every moment of his existence he does not walk he struts he does not talk he declaims almady good morning sees ilona surprised hullo you here turai yes she s here almady but what s the matter has something happened ilona oh do sit down turai grimly he ll sit down quite soon enough i m not afraid of his not sitting down almady to turai you ll forgive me if i seem nervous turai glass of brandy almady thank you deliberately never in the morning turai mr almady you are a married man and the father of a family and you are forcing your attentions on another man s fianc e almady indignantly it s an outrageous lie turai good i thought you were going to say it was none of my business you would have been quite right but a lie no i m afraid that won t do almady aggressively mr turai i would have you know turai shut up almady outraged shut up turai significantly lemon almady sits down abruptly i told you he d sit down almady looks at the left wall yes quite right it s as thin as paper almady rises now come mr turai between two gentlemen turai i beg your pardon almady as one gentleman to another i ask your discretion turai sit down almady sitting down anxiously why is there something else coming turai crosses to right and listens at staircase yes there is something else coming are you sitting down almady yes turai then listen i wasn t the only one who heard everything her fianc was in this room with me at the time and his hearing is excellent almady strangling brandy turai pouring it out in the morning gives almady the brandy almady i always take it in the morning he gulps it down ilona well what are you going to do now you miserable idiot you you see what you ve done you ve driven me to suicide oh god i shall die i shall die almady rising melodramatically i ll die with you ilona i don t want you i m going to die alone almady pompously i am ready to give him satisfaction turai that s the last straw as almady starts to speak i ll tell you what you are going to do you are going to do just as i order almady starting up order turai sit down almady sits down ilona yes order to turai rapidly tell us please never mind how much he rants almady indignantly rants you dare to criticise my diction turai oh damn your diction just thank your stars that i m going to get you out of this a married man father of a family with four children at home four little lemons almady rises one word from you and this telegram all ready and written goes off to your wife almady looks again at wall and groans ilona look at him don t look at the wall last night was the time to have done that turai in that room next door last night something occurred ilona ashamed yes yes please we know what occurred turai that is just what you don t know you are now going to hear what occurred was the rehearsal of a play do you grasp my meaning ilona in the middle of the night turai in the middle of the night almady how do you mean the rehearsal of a play turai your very loud remarks so loud that they actually penetrated the wall were dialogue from a play now do you understand ilona i do to almady don t you idiot rises it s the most marvelous wonderful idea you old darling she is just about to embrace turai when she stops in consternation turai what s the matter ilona it s no good he d never believe it turai why wouldn t he believe it ilona where on earth is there a play with lines in it like those turai where picking up pile of papers from the table here ilona what do you mean turai pointing here you are here s the play this is it ilona who wrote it turai i did don t stare at me my dear child with those starry eyes of blue sits on bench rather ask when i wrote it ilona when could you have written it turai this morning between four and six after all one is either a playwright or one isn t half of it i heard through the wall the other half i wrote to fit in this life everyone has to fight with his own weapons my weapon is the pen and on this occasion i hope it will prove considerably mightier than the sword i am feeling this morning like an acrobat who for once has the chance to use his skill to save a life i don t suppose any play has ever yet been written with such purely altruistic motives well there you are there s the play read it learn it and play it he gives her the manuscript ilona play it turai naturally you must play it how else can you make him believe without a shadow of doubt that what you were saying last night was just dialogue off you go dress rehearsal early this evening opening to night almady to night but where turai at the concert of course after dinner in the ballroom to ilona you re down on the programme already for something or other ilona a couple of songs contemptuously he s to recite some poems turai then there ll be a slight change in the programme he ll act with you instead a one act play ilona looking at script but how on earth can i learn all this by to night almady goes to window turai well really last night you knew it well enough almady sighs deeply what s the matter with you almady comes down mr turai that was a sigh of relief do you know my wife turai i do didn t i tell you that it was a matter of death almady how can i ever thank you he holds out his hand turai ignores it turai don t bother to try if you think i m doing this for your sake my good man you re greatly mistaken unfortunately my life saving apparatus is so constructed that you automatically have to be rescued too ilona oh but listen turai now what is it ilona what earthly reason could we have had for rehearsing at three in the morning turai that s what i ask myself but i answer myself quite simple you had to play the thing to night you d lost a lot of time on a picnic every moment was precious you were so conscientious that when you came home you insisted on rehearsing even though it was three o clock in the morning ilona well we d better go and start studying at once i m a very slow study turai one minute don t get excited who s supposed to be running this concert ilona the count s secretary mr mell turai we must notify him of this change in the programme goes to telephone hello give me mr mell s room please ilona but he ll be asleep turai oh no my dear not after this telephone bell has rung once or twice he hands ilona the receiver there you are ladies first ilona taking telephone but what am i to say turai keep calm i ll prompt you ilona hello is that mr mell yes it is early isn t it she looks at turai for directions turai good morning ilona into the telephone good morning turai how did you sleep ilona her hand over the receiver i can t say that the poor man is furious turai shrugging use your own judgment then ilona into the telephone in her most seductive manner dear mr mell coos i m so dreadfully sorry to wake you up at this hour but i wanted to tell you that there will be a little change in the programme to night i m sure the count will be pleased i m sure you will be pleased i m sure the audience will be pleased turai unanimous ilona into the telephone instead of working alone i m going to appear with mr almady yes mr almady in an extremely witty charming brilliant little duologue turai bows ilona listens at the telephone for a moment then she turns to turai and asks as if she were still speaking to mell what kind of a play is it turai french ilona into the telephone french as before who wrote it turai geraldy ilona geraldy i believe pause oh isn t that nice turai apprehensive what s nice ilona hand over receiver he says he knows every line that geraldy ever wrote turai then it s by sardou ilona into the telephone no i m sorry i ve just been looking at the script again it s not by geraldy it s by sardou turai the great sardou ilona into the telephone the great sardou indeed turai how is he up on sardou ilona covering receiver he says the only thing of sardou s he knows is hedda gabbler turai delighted that s the man for us ilona into the telephone that s the man for us turai no no no that last remark was supposed to be confidential ilona good bye and thank you so much mr mell you ve been so sweet oh of course as if we d dream of having anybody but you as a prompter the title turai a tooth for a tooth ilona into the telephone a truth turai tooth tooth ilona a tooth for a tooth yes isn t it quite snappy coos good bye she hangs up receiver and turns to turai why a french piece turai merely to ensure that nobody will know who wrote it that s the beauty of french literature there s such a lot of it besides one has one s conscience i ve stolen so much from the french in my time that it s only fair i should give them something for a change and now that everything seems to be working out all right let me say with all the emphasis at my disposal get out go and study to almady and so that no one will recognize my handwriting you have got to copy out the script almady all of it turai from beginning to end almady you think of everything turai unlike a certain southern fruit ilona who has been looking through the script oh but this isn t right turai what isn t ilona this line you make me say your kiss is revolting to me what i really said was turai that was your old kiss sweet and burning like hot punch i know my memory is excellent but fortunately we got the boy out of the room before you got that far almady and may i be permitted to inquire why my kiss should be described as revolting turai the line occurs in the second part of the play where i was relying on my native inspiration almady you call my kiss revolting i wish to know why turai that is how i see it i am the author of this play and that is my opinion of your kiss almady goes up stage in a huff ilona i do think you might have made some noise to warn us why couldn t you have coughed or something turai suppose i had what should i have been able to do now you overlook the fact that your very first words my dear ilona left no room for misunderstanding if i had stopped you then nothing could have averted the tragedy almady coming down mollified what a brain turai you flatter me ilona no he doesn t he s right for once did this idea come to you the moment you heard us turai no i got it from you ilona from us turai yes stupid of me i admit you see i always assume the best of my fellowmen and just for a minute i did think that you really were acting later on i realized my mistake ilona you thought we were acting why turai because it all sounded so artificial no ring of conviction i refer particularly to the more erotic passages ilona i don t wonder considering i don t care one little bit for the man almady what s that ilona you heard almady you don t love me ilona no almady furious so you were lying ilona yes almady just to get rid of me ilona with loathing vehemently yes i hate the sight of you almady bitterly serpent ilona i d like to murder you almady bursts into ludicrous sobs ilona my god this is the limit turai if you want to cry all over anyone cry all over me i like it it s like a tonic to me almady what made you realize that we were not acting turai the disgusting sloppy way you began carrying on no author living would dare put slush like that in the mouth of an actor who was supposed to be making love almady sloppy turai beyond words almady with indignation allow me to inform you turai shut up almady his dignity collapsing oh very well turai my friends may be here any minute now please go and study your parts to ilona who has been turning over the leaves of the script that s a bit you ll have to learn particularly well ilona which turai pointing to manuscript these lines here this loathsome series of speeches the ones we overheard last night points from there to there almady looks at script ilona reads odd i hardly remember turai i do nor is your fianc likely to have forgotten ilona reading i worship you i adore you i love you as the church steeple loves the cloud that settles on its summit almady turns away embarrassed just words almady takes script you have used me up and squeezed me like a lemon ilona takes script yes now i remember almady it s all down word for word turai takes script turai yes the passage is underlined in red ink three pages here from page sixteen it goes on come here and let me kiss that beautiful classic brow and then this is the worst bit here this mad outburst of sensuality reads rapidly when i look at that at the perfect shape the rose flush of that skin just to stroke it ilona yes but i turai i know i know reads hands off you said but he couldn t have obeyed you for he goes on my god how round it is how smooth how velvety and then i m afraid he must have got very close indeed for he adds and how fragrant that s right isn t it almady quite right it was fragrant ilona but i turai no my dear you did not there was a complete silence until you exclaimed you mustn t bite both turn away yes i should think you would be ashamed of yourselves he gives ilona the script all right then copy it out and learn it if you ever studied parts in your lives study these we ll have the dress rehearsal at seven thirty sharp here in this room i ll give you a run through and after dinner first performance and now ilona out we go eh turai you took the words out of my mouth and don t forget we ve not seen each other for three months ilona all right three months almady going out a colossal brain they bow turai i thank you almady and ilona go into her room turai sits down and resumes his interrupted breakfast throughout the following scene he goes on eating quietly deliberately and with a good appetite mansky enters at right also in white flannels but looking more doleful and dejected than ever mansky have you been up long turai i couldn t sleep he goes on eating how s our infant mansky woke up a moment ago i left him dressing turai you had breakfast yet mansky not a mouthful couldn t touch it you seem to have no difficulty in putting it away turai with mock sadness one must keep up one s strength mansky i m amazed and if i may say so a little shocked sitting there gorging as if nothing had happened can t you realize we re absolutely ruined i m positively ill thinking about it turai mysteriously shall i let you into a secret mansky mansky with excited anticipation yes tell me turai with great deliberation i am a man who weighs his words i do not speak lightly and i say to you solemnly my friend dramatic pause that this is the best bit of ham i ve ever tasted mansky furious bah crosses left to a mirror turai continuing as before juicy nutty positively good solicitously did the boy sleep at all mansky he dropped off about daylight out of sheer exhaustion looks in the glass i m pale turai say anything mansky not a word just stared at the ceiling you know that s bad turai ceilings aren t so bad walls are much worse mansky what i can t understand is why a magnificent place like this should have walls like tissue paper turai ah these are deep waters mansky irritated do stop eating turai but i haven t finished mansky gobble gobble gobble looks in the glass my god i am pale turai suits you intellectual pallor mansky crosses to turai what about that solution you were hinting at last night turai there were several possibilities i considered them all thoroughly in the night watches while you lay snoring in your bed oh yes i heard you while i was changing my clothes points to the table telegrams letters all ready finally i hit on the best and simplest plan mansky which is turai i m going to do everything possible to make him break with her mansky what for turai because that s the surest way of bringing them together if he casts her off forever in two weeks he ll be rushing after her and falling at her feet the lady after a little coaxing will allow herself to melt he will coax a little more she will melt a little more finally she will melt altogether and the curtain will fall on the lovers slow embrace mansky with cumulative contempt you thought of that in the night did you turai i did mansky all by yourself turai all by myself mansky well i ve noticed

the morning we will go to her and pay our respects and stay on here another day or two and we will not breathe a word of what happened last night you will behave towards her quite nicely and naturally i know it will hurt it s a bitter pill to swallow but to day you are a man adam yes you re right turai up with the head and out with the chin and damn everybody that s the stuff the day after to morrow when we leave you shall write her a letter and let yourself go as much as you like and no matter how it may hurt you have finished with that woman forever adam with an effort very well and if it should hurt too much don t be afraid that i ll go back to her i ll always have pluck enough to put a bullet through my head mansky there see where you have got us to with your psychology turai to adam you ought to be ashamed of yourself adam smilingly it s all right it was silly of me to talk nonsense like that i won t let you down you shall be satisfied with me mansky to adam good then you won t er tear anything up adam no turai you ll behave towards ilona as if nothing had happened adam yes honour bright he holds out his hand turai rises i am satisfied mansky sitting down to breakfast a completely changed man it s an enormous relief to me to see you getting hold of yourself again so capitally eats rapidly bless my soul yes an enormous relief i really feel a little better turai i m proud of you to mansky haven t you finished breakfast yet mansky delighted i can swallow turai so i notice mansky to adam come and join me my boy you ll find your appetite steals back little by little

mansky well a slice of chicken then and some nice hot tea with a drop of brandy adam oh all right sits down mansky to turai who is sitting deep in thought well what s on your mind adam after trying to cheer me up are you going to be depressed yourself mansky do you know what i think s the matter with him he s got another turai you win another problem mansky theatre turai as always mansky oh my god turai last night when we came into this room i was saying how hard it was to begin a play i m now thinking how hard it is to end a second act mansky oh come and end your breakfast turai no i mean it it s worrying me take this situation of ours for instance just as we did yesterday we have had a curious experience we arrived perfectly happy and immediately got a terrible shock a ghastly disillusionment we ve managed to survive it and we ve got ourselves in hand again but suppose these things had happened not in real life but on the stage suppose this were not a real room but a painted set suppose we three were characters in a play who had just passed through the experiences we have passed through mansky well turai well how would you end the act mansky impatiently my dear fellow it s ended already turai in a way yes but don t forget that at the last moment before the curtain actually falls you need something more a new note of suspense a punch both if you can manage it in fact just what is implied in that word curtain curtain curtain the act must end and yet it must not quite end the audience s interest must be snapped up given a jolt so my distinguished collaborator how about it you ve often told me how good you are try your hand at ending the second act of this dismal adventure of ours mansky my dear chap simplicity itself come here sit down turai sits at table now then i m all for the quiet curtain one of those charming delicate things the french do so well you know sophisticated lightly sentimental the smile behind the tear the three friends sit down to breakfast audiences always like to see actors eating the storm has passed the skies are still a little dark but there is sunshine in the heart and all that sort of thing let this sink in for a bit everything very cozy and pleasant business of eating we each have a glass of wine they all take up their glasses for a moment silence their thoughts are busy with what has passed pause capital and then he raises his glass you want a couple of smart lines spoken with something of a flourish thinks oh well then as if he had thought of what he wanted to say to adam my young friend to day you have become a man turai pointing to where he was sitting at the time i said that mansky for always remember turai yes that shows em it s coming mansky not heeding him always remember that in affairs of the heart it is not the first victory that makes us men but the first defeat lifts his glass to woman s treachery which has made our child a man raises his hand toward the curtain curtain curtain starts to come down they put their glasses down on the table simultaneously untasted mansky smiles complacently how s that turai rotten curtain slowly goes up again gets up tame feeble nothing in the nature of a high spot i m not saying it isn t pretty and graceful charming even but it lacks suspense pause to adam how would you do it adam i feeling as i do now turai give us your idea adam with tremendous intensity very well i ll give you my idea we start from where mansky gave that toast mansky to woman s adam rises treachery that s it i d say no i won t drink any toast throws glass against the wall smashing it to bits mansky approvingly effective adam rapidly losing control of himself and becoming hysterical that woman was not just an incident in my life she was my first great passion i promised to act as if nothing had happened i meant to keep that promise but when i remember that i gave her my life and that she whispers words of love to another man and and kisses another man that s such unbearable burning torture that the only right solution grabs small game carving knife from table turai leaping forward hey stop that adam struggling with him no no mansky rushing forward my god you weren t really adam struggling let me go i want to die turai has got knife away from him he looks at it intently adam stands pale and defiant turai what the devil do you think you re doing adam bitterly just finishing the act he sits down mansky follows him and sits down too smiles wanly curtain curtain starts to come down turai putting the knife away very bad curtain goes up slowly again quite impossible death s all right for the end of a play but absolutely no good for a second act besides the scene was too crude i don t say the gallery might not like it but think what the critics would say they despise melodrama suspense is what you want suspense and then a quick curtain mansky and now i suppose you could show us how it really ought to be done turai goes to telephone hello will you give me miss ilona szabo s room please bell sounds in ilona s room mansky starting what on earth ilona s voice hello turai hello ilona ilona s voice yes who is that speaking turai don t you recognize my voice this is sandor turai ilona s voice oh how wonderful are you here then where are you speaking from turai yes i m right here in the castle next door to you number four ilona s voice what a perfectly delightful surprise turai we came by car last night all three of us ilona s voice you don t mean albert too turai yes and mansky if you think that worth mentioning we re

particularly wanted to see you about something can you come in here for a minute replaces receiver and goes to door adam and mansky stand where they are enter ilona with assumed joy and excitement ilona well this is wonderful of you all she kisses turai lightly and crosses quickly to adam who kisses her hands what a surprise albert darling this is a surprise she hangs onto adam s arm sandor to think that it s turai three whole months ilona three whole months since i ve seen you how brown you re looking and younger than ever let me look at you wonderful she crosses to mansky and kisses him on each cheek and mansky how are you mansky dear i think this is too sweet of you all you don t know how i ve been longing to see you when did you get here she returns to adam turai very gravely just a minute ilona he looks through door into her room why mr almady of all people won t you come in enter almady almady nervously good morning turai fancy finding you here after all these years almady pompously passing through just passing through i only wanted to say how d you do to the count but they wouldn t let me go the er the shooting party you know and the concert they insisted on my staying ilona i was so surprised to see him turai pardon me for disturbing you and possibly casting a slight gloom on what must have been a joyful reunion but i have something rather important to say ilona drops adam s arm ilona crosses to turai what do you mean nothing nothing unpleasant i hope turai yes extremely unpleasant ilona sits down terrified to almady please he motions them to sit down well then we arrived here last night long pause and just now we were sitting having breakfast we three to mansky weren t we adam puzzled yes mansky well turai keep quite calm please we were sitting here having breakfast all three of us he lowers his voice and speaks very earnestly i must entreat you all to hear what i am about to say quite calmly don t lose your heads ilona for god s sake almady uneasily well what is it turai holds up his hand please dead silence what i am about to say and i shall not detain you long now must almost inevitably have a shattering effect on the lives both the private and the professional lives of all us five people i have asked myself is it wise to speak and i have answered myself wise or not it is unavoidable ilona ilona rises gasping i have a question to ask you breaks off dead silence then very simply to mansky how s that for suspense mansky yes yes well what now turai nothing that s all smiles curtain curtain comes down quickly and rises immediately he offers ilona his arm as the rest of the group breathe again and relax their tension we ve just been having an argument about the proper way to end a second act leads ilona slowly to door left to hall the others following i couldn t resist the temptation to show these colleagues of mine how by the most simple methods you can make an act end on a note of suspense you see he goes out talking followed first by almady then by adam and mansky mansky going out to adam crazy absolutely crazy thinks of nothing in the world but the theatre the curtain falls again act three as the curtain rises it reveals the room lighted up by the electric sconces and candelabra a large and elaborately painted screen in silver and green has been placed in front of the window it is painted to suggest an orchard the screen shuts out the view of the mediterranean but to the left and right of it we glimpse the lighted esplanade and many more twinkling lights than in the first act for it is early evening there are two garden chairs in front of the screen in the raised portion of the room otherwise the scene is unchanged mr mell the count s secretary and the master of ceremonies enters at left from the hall he is a fussy pale young man with high pitched voice he wears glasses and is in evening clothes he is carrying a wicker table and carrying it with difficulty and discomfort he places it between the two wicker chairs in front of the screen and stands caressing his hands where the table has cut into them mell calls dwornitschek to himself where is that man calls dwornitschek dwornitschek s voice coming sir coming dwornitschek enters from the hall followed by a lackey they are both in formal full dress livery of white with knee breeches and powdered wigs dwornitschek carries a book two letters a scarf and a woman s hat the lackey carries a tall brown hunting hat whip gauntlets and a large luscious peach mell oh there you are at last why are you so late dwornitschek i fell downstairs

the responsibility there is on my shoulders dwornitschek what i always say is never worry too much to day things may be worse to morrow and then you can worry twice as hard mell it does make me so nervous when people want to alter the programme at the last moment first miss szabo says she s going to sing then she says she s going to act he breaks off as almady enters goes to almady good evening sir good evening you are first in the field almady grouchily good evening the others will be here directly they re dressing mell a wonderful shooting party to day sir capital sport capital there is

till night and never a word of thanks almady takes no notice you are very silent mr almady almady i sometimes find it soothing to be silent try it yourself one of these days i take it the concert begins directly after dinner mell immediately following the serving of coffee almady and when does this this play of ours come on mell it is the last item on the programme the place of honour almady bah walks away upstage mell sir follows him almady absorbed in his part which he is studying nothing mell miss szabo tells me that no scenery is required but two elegant chairs and one elegant table almady is that an elegant table mell well really no but what can one expect in a garden oh if only the scene had been an interior there s some perfectly lovely furniture in the count s room genuine louis the fifteenth a very elegant period louis the fifteenth almady i don t care a damn they re all the same to me louis the fifteenth or louis the fourteenth or louis the seventeenth mell but there isn t a louis the seventeenth and i ve often wondered why why i ve wondered should there be a louis the sixteenth and a louis the eighteenth but not a louis the seventeenth almady exasperated oh god ask a furniture dealer mell i did i m always asking furniture dealers but they only know as far as louis the sixteenth that s where the louis stop for furniture dealers whenever i say louis the seventeenth they say you mean the sixteenth and i say no i don t mean louis the sixteenth i mean louis the seventeenth and breaks off and mops his brow i m afraid i m talking a great deal sir almady

man and prompter i turn the music show the ladies to their seats hand bouquets onto the stage and i m expected always to applaud at the right moment i assure you i have often gone to bed after one of these entertainments with my hands so tender i could scarcely hold my toothbrush almady does not answer you will pardon me for mentioning it sir but you don t seem quite your merry old self to night

part by writing it out mell what energy what enthusiasm have you a nice part almady no rotten mell dear dear dear you ll feel better when you hear the applause we re great applauders here we don t

yawning what can i do to kill the time the count is always out riding paris seems very far away amidst these sleepy fields of normandy adam hoof beats heard off mell imitates hoof beats by beating his thighs with his hands ilona hark i hear him coming can this be my husband surely he went off on his horse to visit our old tenant honest jacques benoit mell makes the hoof beats louder and louder almady comes into the scene dramatically ominously but his entrance is completely ruined by mell continuing the hoof beats almady stamps his feet impatiently and at last mell stops almady so madame ilona why what is the matter why do you frown my dear count almady why do i frown that madame you will learn and speedily as sure as my name is count count he can t remember his name adam prompting maurice du veyrier almady as sure as my name is count maurice du veyrier de la grande contumace saint emilion ilona you frighten me maurice almady it is your guilty conscience that frightens you madame adam traitress ilona starts and looks at him nervously adam rises traitress no doubt you supposed me a credulous imbecile whom it was simple to hoodwink enter turai and mansky both in evening dress from the right ilona and almady confused by their guilt for the moment believe that adam is accusing them almady very embarrassed no doubt you i adam still prompting you thought that any story would do for me you imagined that i was fool enough to swallow anything turai coming down horrified thinking that adam is making a scene what adam shhhh goes on prompting no doubt you supposed me a credulous fool turai relieved he grasps the situation o oh takes the script from him let me have that script adam why to ilona aren t i prompting well ilona no almady simultaneously no adam ruffled nothing like being frank mell goes to adam and pats his shoulder don t take it to heart even i wasn t good enough for them adam perhaps you ll tell me where i went wrong turai don t ask so many questions seats himself in mell s place i ll take on this job mell to adam everybody is so rude turai looking at script all right from where you stopped almady glibly traitress you have deceived me i have long had my suspicions i have now in my possession the proofs no doubt you supposed me a credulous imbecile whom it was simple to hoodwink you thought that any story would do for me you imagined that i was fool enough to swallow anything let me tell you madame that you are mistaken for a long time i have suspected that there was something behind all these rides of yours with our neighbor the marquis jean fran ois gilette de la tour d argent day after day for hours at a time you have made a practice of riding with him on the road from duvernois sur sa ne to saint sulpice de la grande parmenti re and slowly at that ilona it s a lie who told you almady silence woman the proofs are in my pocket mon dieu is there no gratitude in this world when i married you who were you a nobody your father brigadier general pierre jean bourmond de la seconde chaumi re rambouillet fell in battle at grande lagruy re sur marne and you eked out a scanty living as a seamstress at your mother s home in the village of saint genevieve in the department of seine et oise so madame and then what happened i came i gave you name rank and wealth such as you had never dreamed of you became madame la countess du veyrier de la grande contumace saint emilion i bestowed upon you not only my estates in pardubien grand amanoir but also my two castles in challenges debicourt de la roman e and at rivalieux quandamouzi res sur vantera aux alpes maritimes he stops exhausted turai don t stop what s wrong almady takes off his hat and gloves puts the whip down on the table and stepping out of character comes down to turai almady it s these damned french names they re perfectly frightful turai i don t see what we can do about it almady you surely don t need them all turai they re in the script almady but i ll go mad trying to memorize them titles with six hyphens in them and names of places with a dozen aux and de la s and sur s and damn it they re all in my part choking with fury it s deadly at least let s leave out that second castle turai coldly my dear fellow have you no sense of dramatic construction if he had given her only one castle the audience would think her perfectly justified in deceiving him if he had given her three they would look on him as a purse proud fool who didn t deserve a faithful wife no two is exactly the right number you can t beat sardou when it comes to technique go on please almady goes up hopelessly and replaces his hat and gloves and takes up the whip almady i made you a countess and a wealthy woman and what return do i get you betray me yes madame betray me with my best friend and nearest neighbor the marquis jean fran ois gilette de la tour d argent lord of perigord des champignons and saint sulpice de la grand parmenti re he breaks off and removes hat and gloves as before my god it s enough to give a fellow apoplexy turai surprised i beg your pardon that doesn t seem to be in the script almady down to turai as before i m sorry i can t help it it s these names turai well i m always open to suggestions what would you like to call the gentleman almady foche or briand or something short like that turai sarcastically perhaps vichy get on please almady goes upstage more hopeless than before ilona nervously oh do let s get on count you have said enough turai so he seems to think ilona i will not endure these shameful accusations you are insulting the woman who bears your name almady again taking off hat and gloves and puts down the whip it s a damned shame turai what is almady i always have to say the whole infernal thing from beginning to end and she just says your name turai coldly we re wasting time almady another word madame and i produce the proof ilona laughing the proof one is amused one smiles almady takes stage and turns a smile which i will make to die upon your lips behold the proof he fuddles in his coat tail pocket from which he belatedly takes the peach with a sinister flourish ilona with insincere terror ah gracious heaven the peach sits almady lays peach on table yes madame the peach the first peach that ripened on the lovingly cherished early blooming richly bearing east indian dwarf peach trees in my orchard at simarineux de la pomme d api making a triumphant entry into the world days ahead of any other peach in the whole of france he turns and glares at turai resentfully turai pays no attention so he resumes his part you know what a passionate fruit grower i am you know that i have tended this peach from its first budding cared for it watched over it wrapped it about with my love kept a diary about it and awaited its ripening like the coming of a messiah and what happens this afternoon i go out riding i am proceeding at a gentle jog trot mell imitates hoof beats as before almady is incensed by his stupidity mell subsides abashed and almady resumes i am proceeding at a gentle jog trot from duvernois sur sa ne to saint sulpice de la grand parmenti re he breaks off with an anguished look at turai turai coldly along the high road almady along the high road and whom should i see there tripping along but juliette your maid i speak to her she betrays embarrassment at seeing me she stammers and ties her apron strings in a knot i ask her where she is going terrified she bursts into tears and whispers my lady sent me to the marquis jean fran ois gilette de la tour d argent curse him turai right this time that was in the script almady why i ask the girl did your mistress send you to the marquis and then suddenly happening to look closer i see that she is trying desperately to hide a little parcel from me i take it from her i open it and what do i see points to peach that peach the king of peaches the apple of my eye my pride and joy my firstborn the supreme peach from the orchards of simarineux de la pomme d api the last word in stoneless fruit which i have been guarding since birth like a baby sister and as if this were not enough wrapped round that glorious specimen of its kind i discover a letter he fuddles in his inside coat pocket draws out a letter sees it is the wrong one replaces it hastily and draws forth the proper one this letter he reads my beloved this is the first peach that has ripened in france this year i send it to you eat it reverently he holds the letter under her nose there ilona are you trying to make me smell it almady i am for even if you were shameless enough to deny your writing you can not deny your perfume or are you proposing to deny it ilona no almady ha then you admit it ilona yes almady you sent him this peach ilona yes almady again takes off his hat and gloves to turai it s simply rank injustice i ve got to say yard long speeches at the top of my voice and all her part consists of is little exclamations like oh no and yes turai yes i noticed that myself these short crisp speeches are characteristic of sardou s women it can t be helped go on please almady goes back puts on hat and gloves more miserable than ever so you accept from me everything love name rank riches estates two castles and then you go about the place sending my most cherished fruit to your lover ilona rises tragically no almady you have the effrontery to pretend that the marquis is not your lover ilona yes almady you mean he is ilona no almady you mean he is not ilona triumphantly yes almady with a theatrical laugh a likely story madame i am a fruit grower the leading amateur horticulturist in france and president of the paris peach club i know i say i know that one does not give fruit like this save where one has first given the heart madame i despise you ilona you consider conduct like mine despicable almady i do ilona good then i have one little question to ask you in the early spring of this year there ripened in your orchard the first crop of white heart cherries to whom did you send those cherries almady turns away embarrassed to my mother the dowager countess du veyrier de la grande contumace saint emilion ilona indeed to your mother then permit me to show you something you are not the only one who has discovered an interesting letter takes letter from table smell that do you recognize the perfume holds it under his nose mell to adam what a situation sardou at his best there s no one like him ilona the perfume is that of mademoiselle emilienne premi re danseuse at the folies berg res whom you honor with your friendship and protection almady how how did you get this ilona never mind always remember letters are like sped arrows you never can tell where they are going to drop mell applauds vigorously to adam an epigram ilona read it please almady reading my dearest this morning that doddering old idiot of a count of mine ilona you notice how your divinity writes of you go on almady reading that doddering old idiot of a count of mine sent me a basket of cherries did i tell you he was a famous fruit grower he says these are the first cherries that have ripened in france

you trust me or you do not if you do i will return if not not almady oh heavens and how long do you expect to stay in paris ilona a week short pause almady suddenly bursting out no i can t live without you i worship you i adore you i love you as the church steeple loves the cloud that settles on its summit only to be wafted away by the first passing breeze i can t live without you not a week not a day not an hour ilona just words at the word church steeple mansky and adam have exchanged a glance of utter astonishment mansky rises but but but just one moment what was that you said ilona i beg your pardon turai now listen please we can t have these interruptions don t pull them up the moment they ve got nicely into the swing of it mell i can t wait to see how it all ends to adam will she leave him or will the memory of their past love prove too strong mansky goes to adam aside to adam this is devilish queer turai quiet quiet please to almady all right go on better go back to not a week not a day not an hour almady not a week not a day not an hour ilona just words almady it s the truth i m crazy about you and you you have used me up and squeezed me like a lemon and now you want to throw me away at the word lemon mansky and adam again exchange glances mansky gets up deeply agitated mansky sandor turai what is it mansky to ilona and almady you ll excuse me i have something very urgent to say to mr turai he crosses to turai and drags him over to the corner below the fireplace do you hear what they re saying turai feigning non comprehension how do you mean do i hear what they re saying mansky i mean didn t those last lines sound familiar to you turai that s right now you mention it i did notice something only i thought it was my fancy mansky to adam come here mell tries to become a part of the whispered conference but adam waves him away and he withdraws upstage disconsolate to turai i give you my word sandor those lines were syllable for syllable the ones we heard last night through the wall turai looking at script by jove you re right this is uncanny mansky go on with the rehearsal or they will be suspecting something i want to hear some more mansky takes hold of adam s arm adam is very excited both listen intently turai well let s get on now you want to throw me away ilona i don t want to throw you away silly oh come on then come here and let me kiss that beautiful classic brow almady goes to her mansky shouting out great heavens ilona jumping what s the matter mansky whispering listen you two they re saying word for word what we heard them say last night do you grasp now what they were doing last night rehearsing simply going through their lines turai to mansky i must admit this has come upon me as a complete surprise really i m quite shaken adam imitate me if i can be perfectly calm you can mansky pointing at turai and he never recognized it ilona mr turai what s going on almady yes what s all the discussion about turai to almady well it s like this mansky says and i m bound to say i agree with him that for the actual performance to night you will have to dig up a classic brow from somewhere almady dig up a classic brow turai you see it s rather awkward the script says kiss that beautiful classic brow almady well turai well you ll have to get one somewhere almady bitterly you think my own would not be convincing mansky my god no almady it has been so described turai in this play yes but if you ll pardon my saying so you wouldn t suggest that any woman of taste could say such a thing in real life almady bitterly very good no doubt the property man will be able to supply me with a face mell is appalled at the prospect of having to get a face but he dutifully makes a notation of it in his little book turai oh my dear fellow all go back to places adam impatiently we re wasting time let s get on turai sh sh we ve only a few minutes more adam no more interruptions mell thank god ilona where were we oh yes come here and let me kiss that beautiful classic brow kisses him on forehead almady that s not a kiss that s a tip mansky surely that line is a trifle vulgar turai it s vulgar because it s spoken by a vulgar man mansky the speaker is a count turai but a dull witted bounder for all that he s the sort of man who would say things like that don t you start trying to teach sardou how to write dialogue almady furious for god s sake are we going to rehearse turai yes go on please almady that s not a kiss that s a tip ilona don t shout like that almady i will shout i m a squeezed lemon that s what i am a lemon the whole world shall know i m a lemon falls sobbing at her feet mansky whispers something to adam adam smiles happily and whispers back they shake hands turai please please what s the matter mansky nothing i was merely saying to adam that i think that word lemon is all wrong turai i think it s excellent absolutely in character the speaker is a big lemon and peach man from saint sulpice de la grande parmenti re and he naturally goes to the orchard for his similes try to realize that he s practically an imbecile with virtually no vocabulary almady looks up from ilona s lap and registers indignation prompting please please to ilona from you my dear to almady you re crying almady sobs ilona please please don t cry i can t bear it you know how fond i am of you she goes to table where peach is almady those nights of love those flaming wonderful nights have you forgotten them so completely he stands up and starts to touch the peach ilona stop control yourself almady gazing at peach you ask me to control myself when i look at that at that perfect shape the rose flush of that skin starts to touch peach just to stroke it ilona hands off almady snatching up the peach holds it in one hand and with the other strokes it voluptuously my god how round it is how smooth how velvety and how fragrant raises it to his mouth ilona you mustn t bite it she snatches his hand mansky gives a shriek and goes into fits of laughter adam stretches his arms out to mansky and roars adam slaps mansky on the back mansky laughing uninterruptedly almady turns away furiously ilona turns away ashamed mansky putting his arm around adam s shoulder still laughing heavens what fools we ve been adam haven t we mell eagerly won t you tell me the joke adam you wouldn t understand ilona what are you two so amused about turai curtly come come we re wasting time let s get on mansky yes get on i want to hear this round smooth velvety and fragrant adam and you mustn t bite ilona you mustn t bite it almady i must i am so hungry adam and mansky go on laughing mell laughs too but with a puzzled look as much as to say i m joining in but i really don t understand almady sits ah well i see i am nothing to you any more ilona oh for goodness sake i swear that no man breaks off unable to go on turai prompting no man who has ever come into my life ilona has meant so much to me as you from the top of your head to the soles of your feet you are a man turai i think we might cut that last bit almady why turai well i mean to say a little too explicit don t you think rather too obvious a sexual implication a wee bit coarse perhaps yes we must consider the feelings of the audience to mell will there be any young girls there to night mell oh yes indeed turai then we must cut it they may bring their parents instead suppose we say i love you even though you are only a poor imitation of a man almady registers rage go on to almady my god i suffer almady bitterly my god i suffer like a sick horse to turai look here that ought to come out turai why almady how could anyone speak of himself so vulgarly turai we went into all that just now just what a cattle raiser would say almady but he s a fruit raiser turai cattle too cattle as a side line ilona don t look so pathetic well come here kiss me you donkey almady furiously to turai it s too much horse and donkey adam aside to mansky this is where i went out how funny it seems now turai looks at script we re getting near the end now they kiss here almady starts to kiss ilona ilona pushing him away oh never mind the kiss kiss over almady offended just as you please i want you to remember that kiss for ever ilona your kiss is revolting to me almady despairingly to turai does that stay in turai my dear fellow we can t cut everything almady but a line like that s so damned personal the audience will loathe me mansky it beats me why on earth you ever chose a part like this almady looks toward turai in mute appeal but turai is adamant and metes out no mercy turai with subtle mockery yes it s no business of mine but i must say i can t understand that either it doesn t help to cut lines here and there it s the whole part the character s a bounder and a fool mansky the author must have loathed this fellow to turai you notice that sandor don t you turai ironically of course i noticed it ilona do let s get to the end rises mademoiselle emilienne describes you as an old fool almady glares turai prompting and so i am almady and so i am yvonne furious so i am mansky you certainly are ilona sincerely it s disgusting that a man of your age should persecute a woman and by playing on her sense of gratitude seek to obtain a love which she would never bestow as a free gift adam crossing down to turai and whispering uncle sandor will you give me your word of honor that ilona shall never know how shamefully i suspected her turai don t be childish adam if ever she found out she d never look at me again turai i ll never tell her ilona please don t interrupt any more adam bows elaborately and says with meaning forgive me ilona accepts his apology with an affectionate gesture and when his back is turned it is she who is mutely asking his forgiveness turai go on ilona think of your wife think of your children almady turns away my children ilona what would your son say your son a highly respected colonel in the dragoons this is too much the actor in almady is crushed he comes down to turai brokenly and speaks supplicatingly almady mr turai turai amiably yes almady it s just a suggestion but couldn t we say lieutenant there turai i m afraid not you see it was general in the text almady wildly my son a general ilona to turai how far back can i go turai at the most a major ilona quickly very well your son a highly respected major in the dragoons almady you are right yvonne the shock would kill him almady breaks off evidently unwilling to speak his next line but turai prompts him relentlessly turai a ridiculous old petticoat chaser almady speaking the lines almost sotto voce in a casual offhand manner a ridiculous old petticoat chaser that s what i am bah turai oh come mr almady not so tamely please more life once more almady comes down to turai and says the line with petulance and irritation a ridiculous old petticoat chaser that s what i am bah turai relentlessly still not quite strong enough more gusto more sincerity almady shouts the line to relieve his fury a ridiculous old petticoat chaser that s what i am bah turai coldly once more please almady shouting to the full limit of his vocal chords in wild desperation a ridiculous old petticoat chaser that s what i am bah turai with approval fine that s it now read it that way at the performance almady returns upstage completely crushed and beaten almady genuinely i promise you i shall never again make myself obnoxious to this woman who loves another man and is sick and tired of me never never again ilona briskly never again almady briskly never again ilona then maurice i will be generous i will not go to paris and you may eat the peach almady hurls himself at the peach my god at last gnaws the peach turai rising curtain mansky the end turai the end mansky he really should have given his wife the peach that would have made a much prettier finish turai oh my dear fellow where s your sense of character the man s selfish to the core he d never give his wife peaches mansky a very unsympathetic part still he played it well turai it fitted him mell dancing about in anguish pointing to almady incoherent with agitation oh oh turai what s the matter with you mell he s eating the peach he s eating the peach i never dreamed he was going to eat the peach i shall have to dash out and get another he rushes off to the hall ilona takes off scarf to adam who stands overcome with happiness well how do you like me in this part adam oh darling you were wonderful simply wonderful and if you want to know what i think this little comedy is worth all shakespeare put together he kisses her hands mansky oh no no no the thing dates terribly when did sardou write it turai i don t know what period sardou is this mr almady almady i should imagine it was his last work mansky then he must have been a very old man at the time it s terrible he probably wrote it just before he died turai or just after to ilona can i have a minute just a few things i d like to tell you about your part ilona yes yes i shall be very grateful to mansky and adam go along we shan t be a moment they go up the stairs at right mansky what beats me is why an actor who has always played heroes picked a part like that for himself he must be terribly fond of acting mansky and adam go out at right turai to almady who is sitting dejectedly at left you seem upset almady miserably not at all he glares at turai turai so you ve decided to take the midnight express directly after the performance almady yes turai i think you re wise a good fruity train highly spoken of by connoisseurs well just to show you the sort of fellows we turais are i ll let you off the major ilona you can say lieutenant almady even lieutenant seems a little turai good god we can t make him a drummer boy almady picks up part very well so be it i suppose i ought to be thankful for small mercies goes toward door to hall turai where are you off to almady i m going to have another go at those infernal french names but in spite of everything thank you almady bows and then goes out ilona going to turai and embracing him sandor you re an angel was it awfully difficult writing that play turai oh no that damned peach stumped me for a while smooth round velvety and fragrant and you mustn t bite it wasn t easy to get round that believe me there are very few things in this world that are round smooth velvety and respectable ilona turns head away oh he was talking about my shoulder turai with delicate irony and gazing at her shoulder then kissing it really i thought it was your forehead ilona you re an old devil that s what you are turai just what i expected now that it s all over everybody else is a gentleman and i m an old devil but somehow i don t think i am my little ilona i have saved a young man a bad heartache it s a negative kindness but is there a positive one that s better yes on the whole i think i m fairly well satisfied with myself and there s a little old woman looking at me from somewhere probably from hell and her eyes seem to be twinkling as if she was satisfied too it s unfortunate that you won t have me always on hand to re enter mansky and adam mansky on the landing to adam poor old turai s feeling awfully sore about all this he had a wonderful scheme for bringing you two together based on what he calls psychology and now he s furious because that won t be needed enter dwornitschek from hall adam sh ilona will hear you let s drop the subject dwornitschek standing at center dinner is served adam meets ilona at center they embrace and kiss lovingly and go out to the hall arm in arm mansky with self satisfaction to turai so my friend it comes down to this there are many clever writers but the most successful of them all is still old man life himself turai that s because he doesn t have to collaborate with you he takes mansky s arm as he passes dwornitschek he stops and looks at him dwornitschek smiling dwornitschek sir turai still dwornitschek thank you dwornitschek thank you sir turai no no my dear dwornitschek thank you turai and mansky
