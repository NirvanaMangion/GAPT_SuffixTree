preface


in  the devil is an ass  jonson may be studied  first  as a student 
secondly  as an observer  separated by only two years from the
preceding play   bartholomew fair   and by nine from the following 
 the staple of news   the present play marks the close of an epoch in
the poet s life  the period of his vigorous maturity  its relations
with the plays of his earlier periods are therefore of especial
interest 

the results of the present editor s study of these and other
literary connections are presented  partly in the notes  and partly
in the introduction to this book  after the discussion of the
purely technical problems in sections a and b  the larger features
are taken up in section c  i and ii  these involve a study of the
author s indebtedness to english  italian  and classical sources  and
especially to the early english drama  as well as of his own dramatic
methods in previous plays  the more minute relations to contemporary
dramatists and to his own former work  especially in regard to
current words and phrases  are dealt with in the notes 

as an observer  jonson appears as a student of london  and a satirist
of its manners and vices  and  in a broader way  as a critic of
contemporary england  the life and aspect of london are treated  for
the most part  in the notes  the issues of state involved in jonson s
satire are presented in historical discussions in section c  iii 
personal satire is treated in the division following 

i desire to express my sincere thanks to professor albert s  cook
for advice in matters of form and for inspiration in the work  to
professor henry a  beers for painstaking discussion of difficult
questions  to dr  de winter for help and criticism  to dr  john m 
berdan for the privilege of consulting his copy of the folio  to
mr  andrew keogh and to mr  henry a  gruener  for aid in bibliographical
matters  and to professor george l  burr for the loan of books from
the cornell library 

a portion of the expense of printing this book has been borne by the
modern language club of yale university from funds placed at its
disposal by the generosity of mr  george e  dimock of elizabeth 
new jersey  a graduate of yale in the class of

introduction


a  editions of the text


 the devil is an ass  was first printed in       and was probably put
into circulation at that time  either as a separate pamphlet or bound
with  bartholomew fair  and  the staple of news   copies of this
original edition were  in         bound into the second volume of the
first folio of jonson s collected works     in      a variant reprint
edition of  the devil is an ass   apparently small  was issued
in pamphlet form  the play reappears in all subsequent collected
editions  these are      the  third folio             a bookseller s
edition                   whalley s edition            john
stockdale s reprint of whalley s edition  together with the works
of beaumont and fletcher             gifford s edition           
barry cornwall s one volume edition            lieut  col  francis
cunningham s three volume reissue  with some minor variations  of
gifford s edition            another reissue by cunningham  in
nine volumes  with additional notes         the  catalogue  of the
british museum shows that jonson s works were printed in two volumes
at dublin in       of these editions only the first two call for
detailed description  and of the others only the first  second 
third  fifth  and eighth will be discussed 

        owing to irregularity in contents and arrangement in
different copies  the second volume of the first folio has been
much discussed  gifford speaks of it as the edition of            
miss bates  copying from lowndes  gives it as belonging to      
reprinted in      and in          ward says substantially the
same thing     in       however  brinsley nicholson  by a careful
collation     arrived at the following results      the so called
editions of the second volume assigned to             and      form
only a single edition      the belief in the existence of  the
so called first edition of the second volume in       is due to the
dates prefixed to the opening plays      the belief in the existence
of the volume of      arose from the dates of  mortimer  and the
 discoveries    all the copies of which are dated        and of
the variant edition of  the devil is an ass   which will next be
described      the      edition supplies for some copies a general
title page   r  meighen         but the plays printed in      are
reprinted from the same forms  hazlitt arrives at practically the
same conclusions    

the volume is a folio by measurement  but the signatures
are in fours

the volume opens with  bartholomew fayre   which occupies pages
              pages         and    misnumbered   or the first group
of signatures given above 

    the staple of newes   paged independently

and     misnumbered    n  recto contains the title page  verso blank  
n   contains a vignette and the persons of the play on the recto  a
vignette and the prologue on the verso  n   to the end contains the
play proper  the epilogue being on the last leaf verso 

one leaf  pages        is thus unaccounted for  but it is evident
from the signatures and pagination that  the diuell is an asse  was
printed with a view to having it follow  bartholomew fayre   these
three plays were all printed by i  b  for robert allot in      
hazlitt says that they are often found together in a separate volume 
and that they were probably intended by jonson to supplement the
folio of         

collation made from copy in the library of yale university at
new haven 

it was the opinion of both whalley and gifford that the publication
of  the devil is an ass  in      was made without the personal
supervision of the author  gifford did not believe that jonson
 concerned himself with the revision of the folio      or  indeed 
ever saw it   the letter to the earl of newcastle   harl  ms         
quoted in gifford s memoir  sufficiently disproves this supposition 
at least so far as  bartholomew fair  and  the devil is an ass 
are concerned  in this letter  written according to gifford about      
jonson says   it is the lewd printer s fault that i can send your
lordship no more of my book  i sent you one piece before  the fair 
    and now i send you this other morsel  the fine gentleman that
walks the town  the fiend  but before he will perfect the rest i fear
he will come himself to be a part under the title of the absolute
knave  which he hath played with me   in      brinsley nicholson
quoted this letter in  notes and queries    th s           and
pointed out that the jocular allusions are evidently to  bartholomew
fair  and  the devil is an ass  

although gifford is to some extent justified in his contempt for the
edition  it is on the whole fairly correct 

the misprints are not numerous  the play is overpunctuated 
thus the words  now  and  again  are usually marked off by
commas  occasionally the punctuation is misleading  the mark of
interrogation is generally  but not invariably  used for that of
exclamation  the apostrophe is often a metrical device  and indicates
the blending of two words without actual elision of either  the most
serious defect is perhaps the wrong assignment of speeches  though
later emendations are to be accepted only with caution  the present
text aims to be an exact reproduction of that of the      edition 

      the pamphlet quarto of      is merely a poor reprint of the
     edition  it abounds in printer s errors  few if any intentional
changes  even of spelling and punctuation  are introduced  little
intelligence is shown by the printer  as in the change    i     sn 
 references are to act  scene  and line  he flags  he stags  it is
however of some slight importance  inasmuch as it seems to have been
followed in some instances by succeeding editions  cf  the omission
of the side notes    i              followed by             and w 
also    i     his  a       f   

the title page of this edition is copied  as far as the quotation
from horace  from the title page of the      edition  for the
wood cut of that edition  however  is substituted the device of a
swan  with the legend  god is my helper   then follow the words 
 imprinted at london        

folio by measurement  signatures in fours 

collation  one leaf  containing the title page on the recto  verso
blank  second leaf with signature a        containing a device  st 
francis preaching to the birds       and the persons of the play on
the recto  and a device  a saint pointing to heaven and hell  and the
prologue on the verso  then the play proper  b i in fours  k  one

numbered     

      the edition of         is a reprint of       but furnishes
evidence of some editing  most of the nouns are capitalized  and
a change of speaker is indicated by breaking the lines  obvious
misprints are corrected  e  g                  the spelling is
modernized  e  g             tiborne  tyburn  and the punctuation is
improved  sometimes a word undergoes a considerable morphological
change  e  g            belins gate  billings gate                
venter  venture  etymology is sometimes indicated by an apostrophe 
not always correctly  e  g            salts   salts  several changes
are uniform throughout the edition  and have been followed by all
later editors  the chief of these are  inough  enough  tother 
t other  coozen  cozen  ha s  has  then  than   hem   em  except g
sometimes   injoy  enjoy  several changes of wording occur  e g

      the edition of      is a bookseller s reprint of       it
follows that edition in the capitalization of nouns  the breaking up
of the lines  and usually in the punctuation  in             over two
lines are omitted by both editions  independent editing  however  is
not altogether lacking  we find occasional new elisions  e  g     
       i have  i ve  at least one change of wording           where 
were  and one in the order of words           not love  love not  in
            and       it corrects two wrong assignments of speeches 
a regular change followed by all editors is wiues  wife s 

      the edition of peter whalley        purports to be  collated
with all the former editions  and corrected   but according to
modern standards it cannot be called a critical text  not only
does it follow      in modernization of spelling  alteration of
contractions  e  g            to a  t a           in t one  int  one 
and changes in wording  e  g            strengths  strength       
   gentleman  gentlewoman  but it is evident that whalley considered
the      edition as the correct standard for a critical text  and
made his correction by a process of occasional restoration of the
original reading  thus in restoring  crane             he uses the
expression    which is authorized by the folio of        again in   
       he retains  petty  from       although he says   the edit 
of       as i think more justly    some  pretty  principality   
this reverence for the      text is inexplicable  in the matter of
capitalization whalley forsakes his model  and he makes emendations
of his own with considerable freedom  he still further modernizes the
spelling  he spells out elided words  e  g            h  has  he has 
makes new elisions  e  g             yo  are  you re            i am 
i m  grammatical changes  sometimes of doubtful correctness  e  g  
         i le  i d  morphological changes  e  g             to scape 
t escape  metrical changes by insertions  e  g             to        
    but now   changes of wording  e  g             sad  said  in the
order of words  e  g            is hee  he is  and in the assignment
of speeches  e  g             several printer s errors occur  e  g  
         and    

      william gifford s edition is more carefully printed than
that of whalley  whom he criticizes freely  in many indefensible
changes  however  he follows his predecessor  even to the insertion
of words in          and               see above   he makes further
morphological changes  even when involving a change of metre  e g  
         totnam  tottenham           phantsie  phantasie  makes new
elisions  e  g             i ha   i ve  changes in wording  e  g  
         o   o   and in assignment of speeches  e  g             he
usually omits parentheses  and the following changes in contracted
words occur  only exceptions being noted in the variants  fro  
from  gi   give  h   he  ha   have   hem  them  but often  em   i  
in  o   on  of  t   to  th   the  upo   upon  wi   with  will  yo  
you  gifford s greatest changes are in the stage directions and
side notes of the      edition  the latter he considered as of  the
most trite and trifling nature   and  a worthless incumbrance   he
accordingly cut or omitted with the utmost freedom  introducing new
and elaborate stage directions of his own  he reduced the number of
scenes from thirty six to seventeen  in this  as hathaway points out 
he followed the regular english usage  dividing the scenes according
to actual changes of place  jonson adhered to classical tradition 
and looked upon a scene as a situation  gifford made his alterations
by combining whole scenes  except in the case of act       which
begins at folio act           middle of line   of act       which
begins at folio act          and of act       which begins at folio
act           middle of line   he considered himself justified in
his mutilation of the side notes on the ground that they were not
from the hand of jonson  evidence has already been adduced to show
that they were at any rate printed with his sanction  i am  however 
inclined to believe with gifford that they were written by another
hand  gifford s criticism of them is to a large extent just  the note
on   niaise              is of especially doubtful value  see note  

       cunningham s reissue        reprints gifford s text without
change  cunningham  however  frequently expresses his disapproval of
gifford s licence in changing the text   winter

b  date and presentation

we learn from the title page that this comedy was acted
in      by the king s majesty s servants  this is further
confirmed by a passage in             

          now  as vice stands this present yeere  remember 
          what number it is   six hundred  and  sixteene  

another passage            tells us that the performance
took place in the blackfriars theatre 

          today  i goe to the  black fryers play house  

that fitzdottrel is to see  the devil is an ass  we learn later
            the performance was to take place after dinner            

at this time the king s men were in possession of two theatres 
the globe and the blackfriars  the former was used in the summer 
so that  the devil is an ass  was evidently not performed during
that season     these are all the facts that we can determine with
certainty 

jonson s masque   the golden age restored   was presented  according
to fleay  on january   and    his next masque was  christmas  his
masque   december           between these dates he must have been
busy on  the devil is an ass   fleay  who identifies fitzdottrel
with coke  conjectures that the date of the play is probably late in
      after coke s discharge in november  if coke is satirized either
in the person of fitzdottrel or in that of justice eitherside  see
introduction  pp  lxx  lxxii   the conjecture may be allowed to have
some weight 

in         fitzdottrel speaks of bretnor as occupying the position
once held by the conspirators in the overbury case  franklin  who
is mentioned  was not brought to trial until november          
jonson does not speak of the trial as of a contemporary or nearly
contemporary event 

act   is largely devoted to a satire of spanish fashions  in         
there is a possible allusion to the infanta maria  for whose marriage
with prince charles secret negotiations were being carried on at this
time  we learn that commissioners were sent to spain on november
    cal  state papers  dom  ser     and from a letter of january
         that  the spanish tongue  dress  etc  are all in fashion 
  ibid    

these indications are all of slight importance  but from their united
evidence we may feel reasonably secure in assigning the date of
presentation to late november or early december       

the play was not printed until       it seems never to have been
popular  but was revived after the restoration  and is given by
downes     in the list of old plays acted in the new theatre in drury
lane after april          he continues   these being old plays 
were acted but now and then  yet being well perform d were very
satisfactory to the town   the other plays of jonson revived by this
company were  the fox    the alchemist    epicoene    catiline

c  the devil is an ass

jonson s characteristic conception of comedy as a vehicle for the
study of  humors  passed in  every man out of his humor  into
caricature  and in  cynthia s revels  and  poetaster  into allegory 
the process was perfectly natural  in the humor study each character
is represented as absorbed by a single vice or folly  in the
allegorical treatment the abstraction is the starting point  and the
human element the means of interpretation  either type of drama  by
a shifting of emphasis  may readily pass over into the other  the
failure of  cynthia s revels   in spite of the poet s arrogant boast
at its close  had an important effect upon his development  and the
plays of jonson s middle period  from  sejanus  to  the devil is an
ass   show more restraint in the handling of character  as well as
far greater care in construction  the figures are typical rather than
allegorical  and the plot in general centres about certain definite
objects of satire  both plot and characterization are more closely
unified 

 the devil is an ass  marks a return to the supernatural and
allegorical  the main action  however  belongs strictly to the type
of the later drama  especially as exemplified by  the alchemist  
the fanciful motive of the infernal visitant to earth was found to
be of too slight texture for jonson s sternly moral and satirical
purpose  in the development of the drama it breaks down completely 
and is crowded out by the realistic plot  thus what promised at first
to be the chief  and remains in some respects the happiest  motive
of the play comes in the final execution to be little better than
an inartistic and inharmonious excrescence  yet jonson s words to
drummond seem to indicate that he still looked upon it as the real
kernel of the play     

the action is thus easily divisible into two main lines  the
devil plot  involving the fortunes of satan  pug and iniquity  and
the satirical or main plot  this division is the more satisfactory 
since satan and iniquity are not once brought into contact with the
chief actors  while pug s connection with them is wholly external 
and affects only his own fortunes  he is  as herford has already
pointed out  merely  the fly upon the engine wheel  fortunate to
escape with a bruising    studies   p        he forms  however  the
connecting link between the two plots  and his function in the drama
must be regarded from two different points of view  according as it
shares in the realistic or the supernatural element 

      a play of his  upon which he was accused  the divell
is ane ass  according to  comedia vetus   in england the divell
was brought in either with one vice or other  the play done the divel
caried away the vice  he brings in the divel so overcome with the
wickedness of this age that thought himself ane ass           
 incidentally  is discoursed of the duke of drounland  the king
desired him to conceal it     conversations with william drummond

i  the devil plot


jonson s title   the devil is an ass   expresses with perfect adequacy
the familiarity and contempt with which this once terrible personage
had come to be regarded in the later elizabethan period  the poet  of
course  is deliberately archaizing  and the figures of devil and vice
are made largely conformable to the purposes of satire  several years
before  in the dedication to  the fox       jonson had expressed his
contempt for the introduction of  fools and devils and those antique
relics of barbarism   characterizing them as  ridiculous and exploded
follies   he treats the same subject with biting satire in  the staple
of news       yet with all his devotion to realism in matters of petty
detail  of local color  and of contemporary allusion  he was  as we
have seen  not without an inclination toward allegory  thus in  every
man out of his humor  the figure of macilente is very close to a purely
allegorical expression of envy  in  cynthia s revels  the process was
perfectly conscious  for in the induction to that play the characters
are spoken of as virtues and vices  in  poetaster  again we have the
purging of demetrius and crispinus  jonson s return to this field
in  the devil is an ass  is largely prophetic of the future course
of his drama  the allegory of  the staple of news  is more closely
woven into the texture of the play than is that of  the devil is an
ass   and the conception of pecunia and her retinue is worked out with
much elaboration  in the second intermean the purpose of this play is
explained as a refinement of method in the use of allegory  for the old
vice with his wooden dagger to snap at everybody he met  or iniquity 
appareled  like hokos pokos  in a juggler s jerkin   he substitutes
 vices male and female    attired like men and women of the time   this
of course is only a more philosophical and abstract statement of the
idea which he expresses in  the devil is an ass             f   of a
world where the vices are not distinguishable by any outward sign from
the virtues 

    they weare the same clothes  eate the same meate 
    sleep i  the self same beds  ride i  those coaches 
    or very like  foure horses in a coach 
    as the best men and women 

 the new inn  and  the magnetic lady  are also penetrated
with allegory of a sporadic and trivial nature  jonson s
use of devil and vice in the present play is threefold  it
is in part earnestly allegorical  especially in satan s long
speech in the first scene  it is in part a satire upon the
employment of what he regarded as barbarous devices  and
it is  to no small extent  itself a resort for the sake of comic
effect to the very devices which he ridiculed 

jonson s conception of the devil was naturally very far from medi val 
and he relied for the effectiveness of his portrait upon current
disbelief in this conception  yet medi valism had not wholly died out 
and remnants of the morality play are to be found in many plays of
the elizabethan and jacobean drama  rev  john upton  in his  critical
observations on shakespeare         was the first to point out the
historical connection between jonson s vice and devils and those of
the pre shakespearian drama  in modern times the history of the devil
and the vice as dramatic figures has been thoroughly investigated  the
latest works being those of dr  l w  cushman and dr  e  eckhardt 
at whose hands the subject has received exhaustive treatment  the
connection with machiavelli s novella of  belfagor  was pointed out
by count baudissin       ben jonson und seine schule   leipzig      
and has been worked out exhaustively by dr  e  hollstein in a halle
dissertation        dr  c h  herford  however  had already suggested
that the chief source of the devil plot was to be found in the legend
of friar rush 

      wks          

      wks          f  cf  also shirley  prologue to  the doubtful heir  

     count baudissin translated two of jonson s comedies into german

    the devil in the pre shakespearian drama 

the sources for the conception of the devil in the medi val drama
are to be sought in a large body of non dramatic literature  in this
literature the devil was conceived of as a fallen angel  the enemy of
god and his hierarchy  and the champion of evil  as such he makes his
appearance in the mystery plays  the mysteries derived their subjects
from bible history  showed comparatively little pliancy  and dealt
always with serious themes  in them the devil is with few exceptions a
serious figure  occasionally  however  even at this early date  comedy
and satire find place  the most prominent example is the figure of
titivillus in the towneley cycle 

in the early moralities the devil is still of primary importance  and
is always serious  but as the vice became a more and more prominent
figure  the devil became less and less so  and in the later drama his
part is always subordinate  the play of  nature   c        is the first
morality without a devil  out of fifteen moralities of later date
tabulated by cushman  only four are provided with this character 

the degeneration of the devil as a dramatic figure was inevitable  his
grotesque appearance  at first calculated to inspire terror  by its
very exaggeration produced  when once familiar  a wholly comic effect 
when the active comic parts were assumed by the vice  he became a mere
butt  and finally disappears 

one of the earliest comic figures in the religious drama
is that of the clumsy or uncouth servant      closely allied
to him is the under devil  who appears as early as  the
harrowing of hell   and this figure is constantly employed
as a comic personage in the later drama      the figure of
the servant later developed into that of the clown  and in
this type the character of the devil finally merged     

     eckhardt  p     f  

      ibid    p     f  

     in general the devil is more closely related to the
clown  and the vice to the fool  in some cases  however  the devil
is to be identified with the fool  and the vice with the clown 


    jonson s treatment of the devil 

in the present play the devil type is represented by the arch fiend
satan and his stupid subordinate  pug  of these two satan received
more of the formal conventional elements of the older drama  while pug
for the most part represents the later or clownish figure  as in the
morality play satan s chief function is the instruction of his emissary
of evil  in no scene does he come into contact with human beings  and
he is always jealously careful for the best interests of his state  in
addition jonson employs one purely conventional attribute belonging to
the tradition of the church  and morality plays  this is the cry of
 ho  ho    with which satan makes his entrance upon the stage in the
first scene      other expressions of emotion were also used  but  ho 
ho   came in later days to be recognized as the conventional cry of the
fiend upon making his entrance     

how the character of satan was to be represented is of course
impossible to determine  the devil in the pre shakespearian drama was
always a grotesque figure  often provided with the head of a beast and
a cow s tail      in the presentation of jonson s play the ancient
tradition was probably followed  satan s speeches  however  are not
undignified  and too great grotesqueness of costume must have resulted
in considerable incongruity 

in the figure of pug few of the formal elements of the
pre shakespearian devil are exhibited  he remains  of course  the
ostensible champion of evil  but is far surpassed by his earthly
associates  both in malice and in intellect  in personal appearance he
is brought by the assumption of the body and dress of a human being
into harmony with his environment  a single conventional episode 
with a reversal of the customary proceeding  is retained from the
morality play  while pug is languishing in prison  iniquity appears 
pug mounts upon his back  and is carried off to hell  iniquity comments
upon it 

    the diuell was wont to carry away the euill 
    but  now  the euill out carries the diuell 

that the practice above referred to was a regular or even
a frequent feature of the morality play has been disputed 
but the evidence seems fairly conclusive that it was common
in the later and more degenerate moralities  at any rate 
like the cry of  ho  ho   it had come to be looked upon
as part of the regular stock in trade  and this was enough
for jonson s purpose      this motive of the vice riding the
devil had changed from a passive to an active comic part 
instead of the devil s prey he had become in the eyes of
the spectators the devil s tormentor  jonson may be looked
upon as reverting  perhaps unconsciously  to the original
and truer conception 

in other respects pug exhibits only the characteristics of the
inheritor of the devil s comedy part  the butt or clown  as we have
seen  one of the chief sources  as well as one of the constant modes
of manifestation  of this figure was the servant or man of low social
rank  pug  too  on coming to earth immediately attaches himself to
fitzdottrel as a servant  and throughout his brief sojourn on earth he
continues to exhibit the wonted stupidity and clumsy uncouthness of
the clown  he appears  to be sure  in a fine suit of clothes  but he
soon shows himself unfit for the position of gentleman usher  and his
stupidity appears at every turn  the important element in the clown s
comedy part  of a contrast between intention and accomplishment 
is of course exactly the sort of fun inspired by pug s repeated
discomfiture  with the clown it often takes the form of blunders
in speech  and his desire to appear fine and say the correct thing
frequently leads him into gross absurdities  this is brought out with
broad humor in            where pug  on being catechized as to what
he should consider  the height of his employment   stumbles upon the
unfortunate suggestion   to find out a good  corne cutter    his
receiving blows at the hand of his master further distinguishes him
as a clown  the investing of pug with such attributes was  as we have
seen  no startling innovation on jonson s part  moreover  it fell
into line with his purpose in this play  and was the more acceptable
since it allowed him to make use of the methods of realism instead
of forcing him to draw a purely conventional figure  pug  of course 
even in his character of clown  is not the unrelated stock figure 
introduced merely for the sake of inconsequent comic dialogue and rough
horse play  his part is important and definite  though not sufficiently
developed 

     in the digby group of miracle plays roaring by the devil is a
prominent feature  stage directions in  paul  provide for  cryeing
and rorying  and belial enters with the cry   ho  ho  behold me  
among the moralities  the disobedient child  may be mentioned 

     so in  gammer gurton s needle   c       we read   but
diccon  diccon  did not the devil cry ho  ho  ho   cf  also the
translation of goulart s histories        quoted by sharp  p      
 the fellow  coming to the stove  sawe the diuills in horrible
formes  some sitting  some standing  others walking  some ramping
against the walles  but al of them  assoone as they beheld him 
crying hoh  hoh  what makest thou here  

     cf  the words of robin goodfellow in  wily beguiled 
  o  pl     th ed             i ll put me on my great carnation nose 
and wrap me in a rowsing calf skin suit and come like some hobgoblin 
or some devil ascended from the grisly pit of hell  

     cushman points out that it occurs in only one drama 
that of  like will to like   he attributes the currency of the notion
that this mode of exit was the regular one to the famous passage in
harsnet s  declaration of popish impostures   p               it was
a pretty part in the old church playes  when the nimble vice would
skip up nimbly like a jackanapes into the devil s necke  and ride the
devil a course  and belabour him with his wooden dagger  till he made
him roare  whereat the people would laugh to see the devil so
vice haunted   the moralities and tragedies give no indication of
hostility between vice and devil  cushman believes therefore that
harsnet refers either to some lost morality or to  punch and judy  
it is significant  however  that in  punch and judy   which gives
indications of being a debased descendant of the morality  the devil
enters with the evident intention of carrying the hero off to hell 
the joke consists as in the present play in a reversal of the usual
proceeding  eckhardt  p     n   points out that the vice s cudgeling
of the devil was probably a mere mirth provoking device  and
indicated no enmity between the two  moreover the motive of the
devil as an animal for riding is not infrequent  in the  castle of
perseverance  the devil carries away the hero  humanum genus  the
motive appears also in greene s  friar bacon and friar bungay  and
lodge and greene s  looking glass for london and england   and
especially in  histriomastix   where the vice rides a roaring devil
 eckhardt  pp     f    we have also another bit of evidence from
jonson himself  in  the staple of news  mirth relates her reminiscences
of the old comedy  in speaking of the devil she says   he
would carry away the vice on his back quick to hell in every play  


    the influence of robin goodfellow and of popular legend 

a constant element of the popular demonology was the belief in the
kobold or elfish sprite  this figure appears in the mysteries in
the shape of titivillus  but is not found in the moralities  robin
goodfellow  however  makes his appearance in at least three comedies 
 midsummer night s dream            grim  the collier of croyden  
c       and  wily beguiled         the last of these especially
approaches jonson s conception  here robin goodfellow is a malicious
intriguer  whose nature  whether human or diabolical  is left somewhat
in doubt  his plans are completely frustrated  he is treated with
contempt  and is beaten by fortunatus  the character was a favorite
with jonson  in the masque of  the satyr             that character
is addressed as pug  which here seems evidently equivalent to puck or
robin goodfellow  similarly thomas heywood makes kobald  hobgoblin 
robin goodfellow  and pug practically identical      butler  in the
 hudibras       gives him the combination title of good  pug robin  
jonson s character of pug was certainly influenced in some degree both
by the popular and the literary conception of this  lubber fiend  

the theme of a stupid or outwitted devil occurred also both in ballad
literature     and in popular legend  roskoff     places the change in
attitude toward the devil from a feeling of fear to one of superiority
at about the end of the eleventh century  the idea of a baffled devil
may have been partially due to the legends of the saints  where the
devil is constantly defeated  though he is seldom made to appear stupid
or ridiculous  the notion of a  stupid devil  is not very common in
english  but occasionally appears  in the virgilius legend the fiend
is cheated of his reward by stupidly putting himself into the physical
power of the wizard  in the friar bacon legend the necromancer delivers
an oxford gentleman by a trick of sophistry      in the story upon
which the drama of  the merry devil of edmonton  was founded  the devil
is not only cleverly outwitted  but appears weak and docile in his
indulgence of the wizard s plea for a temporary respite  it may be said
in passing  in spite of herford s assertion to the contrary  that the
supernatural machinery in this play has considerably less connection
with the plot than in  the devil is an ass   both show a survival of
a past interest  of which the dramatist himself realizes the obsolete
character

    friar rush and dekker 

it was the familiar legend of friar rush which furnished the groundwork
of jonson s play  the story seems to be of danish origin  and first
makes its appearance in england in the form of a prose history
during the latter half of the sixteenth century  it is entered in
the  stationer s register          and mentioned by reginald scot in
          as early as       however  the figure of friar rush on a
 painted cloth  was a familiar one  and is so mentioned in  gammer
gurton s needle       the first extant edition dates from       and has
been reprinted by w  j  thoms      the character had already become
partially identified with that of robin goodfellow      and this
identification  as we have seen  jonson was inclined to accept 

in spite of many variations of detail the kernel of the rush story is
precisely that of jonson s play  the visit of a devil to earth with
the purpose of corrupting men  both rush and pug assume human bodies 
the former being  put in rayment like an earthly creature   while the
latter is made subject  to all impressions of the flesh  

rush  unlike his counterpart  is not otherwise bound to definite
conditions  but he too becomes a servant  the adventure is not of his
own seeking  he is chosen by agreement of the council  and no mention
is made of the emissary s willingness or unwillingness to perform
his part  later  however  we read that he stood at the gate of the
religious house  all alone and with a heavie countenance   in the
beginning  therefore  he has little of pug s thirst for adventure 
but his object is at bottom the same   to goe and dwell among these
religious men for to maintaine them the longer in their ungracious
living   like pug  whose request for a vice is denied him  he goes
unaccompanied  and presents himself at the priory in the guise of a
young man seeking service   sir  i am a poore young man  and am out of
service  and faine would have a maister      

most of the remaining incidents of the rush story could not be used
in jonson s play  two incidents may be mentioned  rush furthers the
amours of his master  as pug attempts to do those of his mistress 
in the later history of rush the motive of demoniacal possession is
worked into the plot  in a very important respect  however  the legend
differs from the play  up to the time of discovery rush is popular
and successful  he is nowhere made ridiculous  and his mission of
corruption is in large measure fulfilled  the two stories come together
in their conclusion  the discovery that a real devil has been among
them is the means of the friars  conversion and future right living  a
precisely similar effect takes place in the case of fitzdottrel 

the legend of friar rush had already twice been used
in the drama before it was adopted by jonson  the play
by day and haughton to which henslowe refers     is not
extant  dekker s drama   if this be not a good play  the
diuell is in it   appeared in       jonson in roundabout
fashion acknowledged his indebtedness to this play by the
closing line of his prologue 

          if this play doe not like  the diuell is in t 

dekker s play adds few new elements to the story  the first scene is
in the infernal regions  not  however  the christian hell  as in the
prose history  but the classical hades  this change seems to have
been adopted from machiavelli  three devils are sent to earth with
the object of corrupting men and replenishing hell  they return  on
the whole  successful  though the corrupted king of naples is finally
redeemed 

in certain respects  however  the play stands closer to jonson s drama
than the history  in the first place  the doctrine that hell s vices
are both old fashioned and outdone by men  upon which satan lays so
much stress in his instructions to pug in the first scene  receives a
like emphasis in dekker 

                            tis thought
    that men to find hell  now  new waies have sought 
    as spaniards did to the indies 

and again 

                             aboue vs dwell 
    diuells brauer  and more subtill then in hell     

and finally 

    they scorne thy hell  hauing better of their owne 

in the second place lurchall  unlike rush  but in the same way
as pug  finds himself inferior to his earthly associates  he
acknowledges himself overreached by bartervile  and confesses 

    i came to teach  but now  me thinkes  must learne 

a single correspondence of lesser importance may be added  both devils 
when asked whence they come  obscurely intimate their hellish origin 
pug says that he comes from the devil s cavern in derbyshire  rufman
asserts that his home is helvetia

    the novella of belfagor and the comedy of grim 

the relation between jonson s play and the novella attributed to
niccol  machiavelli             has been treated in much detail by dr 
ernst hollstein  dr  hollstein compares the play with the first known
english translation  that by the marquis of wharton in           it is
probable  however  that jonson knew the novella in its italian shape 
if he knew it at all      the italian text has therefore been taken as
the basis of the present discussion  while dr  hollstein s results  so
far as they have appeared adequate or important  have been freely used 

                    and were it number d well 
    there are more devils on earth than are in hell 

 


both novella and play depart from the same idea  the visit of a devil
to earth to lead a human life  both devils are bound by certain
definite conditions  belfagor must choose a wife  and live with her ten
years  pug must return at midnight  belfagor  like pug  must be subject
to  ogni infortunio nel quale gli uomini scorrono  

in certain important respects machiavelli s story differs essentially
from jonson s  both dekker and machiavelli place the opening scene in
the classical hades instead of in the christian hell  but dekker s
treatment of the situation is far more like jonson s than is the
novella s  herford makes the distinction clear   macchiavelli s hades
is the council chamber of an italian senate  dekker s might pass for
some tavern haunt of thames watermen  dekker s fiends are the drudges
of pluto  abused for their indolence  flogged at will  and peremptorily
sent where he chooses  machiavelli s are fiends whose advice he
requests with the gravest courtesy and deference  and who give it
with dignity and independence   further  the whole object of the
visit  instead of being the corruption of men  is a mere sociological
investigation  pug is eager to undertake his mission  belfagor is
chosen by lot  and very loath to go  pug becomes a servant  belfagor a
nobleman 

but in one very important matter the stories coincide  that of the
general character and fate of the two devils  as hollstein points out 
each comes with a firm resolve to do his best  each finds at once that
his opponents are too strong for him  each through his own docility
and stupidity meets repulse after repulse  ending in ruin  and each is
glad to return to hell  this  of course  involves the very essence of
jonson s drama  and on its resemblance to the novella must be based any
theory that jonson was familiar with the latter 

of resemblance of specific details not much can be made  the two
stories have in common the feature of demoniacal possession  but
this  as we have seen  occurs also in the rush legend  the fact that
the princess speaks latin  while fitzdottrel surprises his auditors
by his  several languages   is of no more significance  this is one
of the stock indications of witchcraft  it is mentioned by darrel 
and jonson could not have overlooked a device so obvious  certain
other resemblances pointed out by dr  hollstein are of only the most
superficial nature  on the whole we are not warranted in concluding
with any certainty that jonson knew the novella at all 

on the other hand  he must have been acquainted with
the comedy of  grim  the collier of croydon   c       
herford makes no allusion to this play  and  though it was
mentioned as a possible source by a  w  ward      the subject
has never been investigated  the author of  grim  uses the
belfagor legend for the groundwork of his plot  but handles
his material freely  in many respects the play is a close
parallel to  the devil is an ass   the same respect for the
vices of earth is felt as in dekker s and jonson s plays 
belphegor sets out to

                         make experiment
    if hell be not on earth as well as here 

the circumstances of the sending bear a strong resemblance to the
instructions given to pug 

    thou shalt be subject unto human chance 
    so far as common wit cannot relieve thee 
    but whatsover happens in that time 
    look not from us for succour or relief 
    this shalt thou do  and when the time s expired 
    bring word to us what thou hast seen and done 

so in jonson 

                        but become subject
    to all impression of the flesh  you take 
    so farre as humane frailty     
    but as you make your soone at nights relation 
    and we shall find  it merits from the state 
    you shall haue both trust from vs  and imployment 

belphegor is described as  patient  mild  and pitiful   and during his
sojourn on earth he shows little aptitude for mischief  but becomes
merely a butt and object of abuse  belphegor s request for a companion 
unlike that of pug  is granted  he chooses his servant akercock 
who takes the form of robin goodfellow  robin expresses many of the
sentiments to be found in the mouth of pug  with the latter s monologue
 text        compare robin s exclamation 

    zounds  i had rather be in hell than here 

neither pug  text             nor robin dares to return without
authority 

    what shall i do  to hell i dare not go 
    until my master s twelve months be expir d 

like pug  text              belphegor worries over his reception in
hell 

    how shall i give my verdict up to pluto
    of all these accidents 

finally belphegor s sensational disappearance through the
yawning earth comes somewhat nearer to jonson than does
the italian original  the english comedy seems  indeed 
to account adequately for all traces of the belfagor story
to be found in jonson s play 

     a paraphrase of  belfagor  occurs in the conclusion of
barnaby riche s  riche his farewell to militarie profession        
published for the shakespeare society by j  p  collier        the
name is changed to balthasar  but the main incidents are the same 

     jonson refers to machiavelli s political writings in
      timber   ed  schelling  p      

      eng  dram  lit          


    summary 

it is certain that of the two leading ideas of jonson s comedy  the
sending of a devil to earth with the object of corrupting men is
derived from the rush legend  it is probable that the no less important
motive of a baffled devil  happy to make his return to hell  is due
either directly or indirectly to machiavelli s influence  this motive 
as we have seen  was strengthened by a body of legend and by the
treatment of the devil in the morality play 


    the figure of the vice 

it is the figure of the vice which makes jonson s satire on the
out of date moralities most unmistakable  this character has been
the subject of much study and discussion  and there is to day no
universally accepted theory as to his origin and development  in the
literature of jonson s day the term vice is almost equivalent to
harlequin  but whether this element of buffoonery is the fundamental
trait of the character  and that of intrigue is due to a confusion
in the meaning of the word  or whether the element of intrigue is
original  and that of buffoonery has taken its place by a process of
degeneration in the vice himself  is still a disputed question 

the theory of cushman and of eckhardt is substantially the same 
and may be stated as follows  whether or not the vice be a direct
descendant of the devil  it is certain that he falls heir to his
predecessor s position in the drama  and that his development is
strongly influenced by that character  originally  like the devil  he
represents the principle of evil and may be regarded as the summation
of the seven deadly sins  from the beginning  however  he possessed
more comic elements  much being ready made for him through the partial
degeneration of the devil  while the material of the moralities was
by no means so limited in scope as that of the mysteries  this comic
element  comparatively slight at first  soon began to be cultivated
intentionally  and gradually assumed the chief function  while the
allegorical element was largely displaced  in course of time the
transformation from the intriguer to the buffoon became complete     
moreover  the rapidity of the transformation was hastened by the
influence of the fool  a new dramatic figure of independent origin 
but the partial successor upon the stage of the vice s comedy part  as
early as      the union of fool and vice is plainly visible      in
     we find express stage directions given for the vice to fill in
the pauses with improvised jests      two years later a vice plays the
leading r le for the last time      by      the vice has completely
lost his character of intriguer      and in the later drama he appears
only as an antiquated figure  where he is usually considered as
identical with the fool or jester      cushman enumerates the three
chief r les of the vice as the opponent of the good  the corrupter of
man  and the buffoon 

the vice  however  is not confined to the moralities  but appears
frequently in the comic interludes  according to the theory of cushman 
the name vice stands in the beginning for a moral and abstract idea 
that of the principle of evil in the world  and must have originated
in the moralities  and since it is applied to a comic personage in
the interludes  this borrowing must have taken place after the period
of degeneration had already begun  to this theory chambers     offers
certain important objections  he points out that  although  vices in
the ordinary sense of the word are of course familiar personages in the
morals   the term vice is not applied specifically to a character in
 any pre elizabethan moral interlude except the marian  respublica   
      furthermore   as a matter of fact  he comes into the interlude
through the avenue of the farce   the term is first applied to the
leading comic characters in the farces of john heywood   love  and
 the weather            these characters have traits more nearly
resembling those of the fool and clown than those of the intriguer of
the moralities  chambers concludes therefore that  the character of the
vice is derived from that of the domestic fool or jester   and that
the term was borrowed by the authors of the moralities from the comic
interludes 

these two views are widely divergent  and seem at first wholly
irreconcilable  the facts of the case  however  are  i believe 
sufficiently clear to warrant the following conclusions      the early
moralities possessed many allegorical characters representing vices
in the ordinary sense of the word      from among these vices we may
distinguish in nearly every play a single character as in a pre minent
degree the embodiment of evil      to this chief character the name of
vice was applied about       and with increasing frequency after that
date      whatever may have been the original meaning of the word  it
must have been generally understood in the moralities in the sense
now usually attributed to it  for     the term was applied in the
moralities only to a character in some degree evil  chambers instances
 the tide tarrieth for no man  and the tragedy of  horestes   where
the vice bears the name of courage  as exceptions  the cases  however 
are misleading  in the former  courage is equivalent to  purpose  
 desire   and is a distinctly evil character      in the latter he
reveals himself in the second half of the play as revenge  and although
he incites horestes to an act of justice  he is plainly opposed to
 amyte   and he is finally rejected and discountenanced  moreover
he is here a serious figure  and only occasionally exhibits comic
traits  he cannot therefore be considered as supporting the theory
of the original identity of the fool and the vice      the vice of
the comic interludes and the leading character of the moralities are
distinct figures  the former was from the beginning a comic figure or
buffoon      the latter was in the beginning serious  and continued to
the end to preserve serious traits  with which of these two figures
the term vice originated  and by which it was borrowed from the other 
is a matter of uncertainty and is of minor consequence  these facts 
however  seem certain  and for the present discussion sufficient  that
the vices of the earlier and of the later moralities represent the
same stock figure  that this figure stood originally for the principle
of evil  and only in later days became confused with the domestic
fool or jester  that the process of degeneration was continuous and
gradual  and took place substantially in the manner outlined by cushman
and eckhardt  and that  while to the playwright of jonson s day the
term was suggestive primarily of the buffoon  it meant also an evil
personage  who continued to preserve certain lingering traits from the
character of intriguer in the earlier moralities

    jonson s use of the vice 

the position of the vice has been discussed at some length because
of its very important bearing on jonson s comedy  it is evident 
even upon a cursory reading  that jonson has not confined himself to
the conception of the vice obtainable from a familiarity with the
interludes alone  as shown in heywood s farces or the comedy of  jack
juggler   the character of iniquity  though fully identified with the
buffoon of the later plays  is nevertheless closely connected in the
author s mind with the intriguer of the old moralities  this is clear
above all from the use of the name iniquity  from his association with
the devil  and from pug s desire to use him as a means of corrupting
his playfellows  thus  consciously or unconsciously on jonson s part 
iniquity presents in epitome the history of the vice 

his very name  as we have said  links him with the morality play  in
fact  all the vices suggested  iniquity  fraud  covetousness  and lady
vanity  are taken from the moralities  the choice of iniquity was
not without meaning  and was doubtless due to its more general and
inclusive significance  in shakespeare s time vice and iniquity seem
to have been synonymous terms  see schmidt   from which it has been
inferred that iniquity was the vice in many lost moralities     

of the original vice traits iniquity lays vigorous claim to that of the
corrupter of man  pug desires a vice that he may  practice there with
any play fellow   and iniquity comes upon the stage with voluble
promises to teach his pupil to  cheat  lie  cog and swagger   he offers
also to lead him into all the disreputable precincts of the city 
iniquity appears in only two scenes  act    sc    and act    sc     in
the latter he reverses the usual process and carries away the devil to
hell  this point has already been discussed  p  xxiv  

aside from these two particulars  iniquity is far nearer to the fool
than to the original vice  as he comes skipping upon the stage in the
first scene  reciting his galloping doggerel couplets  we see plainly
that the element of buffoonery is uppermost in jonson s mind  further
evidence may be derived from the particularity with which iniquity
describes the costume which he promises to pug  and which we are
doubtless to understand as descriptive of his own  attention should
be directed especially to the wooden dagger  the long cloak  and the
slouch hat  cushman says  p         the vice enjoys the greatest
freedom in the matter of dress  he is not confined to any stereotyped
costume      the opinion that he is always or usually dressed in a
fool s costume has absolutely no justification   the wooden dagger  a
relic of the roman stage      is the most frequently mentioned article
of equipment  it is first found          as part of the apparel of jack
juggler in a print illustrating that play  reproduced by dodsley  it is
also mentioned in  like will to like    hickescorner    king darius  
etc  the wooden dagger was borrowed  however  from the fool s costume 
and is an indication of the growing identification of the vice with
the house fool  that jonson recognized it as such is evident from his
 expostulation with inigo jones  

    no velvet suit you wear will alter kind 
    a wooden dagger is a dagger of wood 

the long cloak  twice mentioned           and      is another
property borrowed from the fool  the natural fool usually wore a
long gown like dress      and this was later adopted as a dress for
the artificial fool  muckle john  the court fool of charles i   was
provided with  a long coat and suit of scarlet colour serge      

satan s reply to pug s request for a vice is  however  the most
important passage on this subject  he begins by saying that the vice 
whom he identifies with the house fool  is fifty years out of date 
only trivial and absurd parts are left for iniquity to play  the
mountebank tricks of the city and the tavern fools  douce  pp     
f   mentions nine kinds of fools  among which the following appear 
   the general domestic fool     the city or corporation fool    
tavern fools  satan compares iniquity with each of these in turn  the
day has gone by  he says 

    when euery great man had his  vice  stand by him 
    in his long coat  shaking his wooden dagger 

then he intimates that iniquity may be able to play the
tavern fool 

    where canst thou carry him  except to tauernes 
    to mount vp ona joynt stoole  with a  iewes  trumpe 
    to put downe  cokeley   and that must be to citizens 

and finally he compares him with the city fool 

    hee may perchance  in taile of a sheriffes dinner 
    skip with a rime o  the table  from  new nothing  
    and take his  almaine  leape into a custard 

thus not only does jonson identify the vice with the fool  but with the
fool in his senility  the characteristic functions of the jester in the
shakespearian drama  with his abundant store of improvised jests  witty
retorts  and irresistible impudence  have no part in this character  he
is merely the mountebank who climbs upon a tavern stool  skips over the
table  and leaps into corporation custards 

iniquity  then  plays no real part in the drama  his introduction is
merely for the purpose of satire  in  the staple of news  the subject
is renewed  and treated with greater directness 

  tat   i would fain see the fool  gossip  the fool is the
finest man in the company  they say  and has all the wit 
he is the very justice o  peace o  the play  and can commit
whom he will and what he will  error  absurdity  as the toy
takes him  and no man say black is his eye  but laugh at him  

in  epigram      on the town s honest man   jonson
again identifies the vice with the mountebank  almost in
the same way as he does in  the devil is an ass  

                         this is one
    suffers no name but a description
    being no vicious person but the vice
    about the town     
    at every meal  where it doth dine or sup 
    the cloth s no sooner gone  but it gets up 
    and shifting of its faces  doth play more
    parts than the italian could do with his door 
    acts old iniquity and in the fit
    of miming gets the opinion of a wit 

     this designation for the vice first appears in  nice wanton  
         then in  king darius         and  histriomastix       
 printed

      ibid    p      




ii  the satirical drama


it was from aristophanes     that jonson learned to combine with
such boldness the palpable with the visionary  the material with the
abstract  he surpassed even his master in the power of rendering the
combination a convincing one  and his method was always the same  fond
as he was of occasional flights of fancy  his mind was fundamentally
satirical  so that the process of welding the apparently discordant
elements was always one of rationalizing the fanciful rather than
of investing the actual with a far away and poetic atmosphere  thus
even his purely supernatural scenes present little incongruity  satan
and iniquity discuss strong waters and tobacco  whitechapel and
billingsgate  with the utmost familiarity  even hell s  most exquisite
tortures  are adapted in part from the homely proverbs of the people 
in the use of his sources three tendencies are especially noticeable 
the motivation of borrowed incidents  the adjusting of action on a
moral basis  the reworking of his own favorite themes and incidents 

     see herford  p      


    general treatment of the plot 

for the main plot we have no direct source  it represents  however 
jonson s typical method  it has been pointed out     that the
characteristic jonsonian comedy always consists of two groups  the
intriguers and the victims  in  the devil is an ass  the most purely
comic motive of the play is furnished by a reversal of the usual
relation subsisting between these two groups  here the devil  who was
wont to be looked upon as arch intriguer  is constantly  fooled off
and beaten   and thus takes his position as the comic butt  pug  in a
sense  represents a satirical trend  through him jonson satirizes the
outgrown supernaturalism which still clung to the skirts of jacobean
realism  and at the same time paints in lively colors the vice of a
society against which hell itself is powerless to contend  it is only 
however  in a general way  where the devil stands for a principle  that
pug may be considered as in any degree satirical  in the particular
incident he is always a purely comic figure  and furnishes the mirth
which results from a sense of the incongruity between anticipation and
accomplishment 

fitzdottrel  on the other hand  is mainly satirical  through him jonson
passes censure upon the city gallant  the attendant at the theatre  the
victim of the prevalent superstitions  and even the pretended demoniac 
his dupery  as in the case of his bargain with wittipol  excites
indignation rather than mirth  and his final discomfiture affords us
almost a sense of poetic justice  this character stands in the position
of chief victim 

in an intermediate position are merecraft and everill  they succeed in
swindling fitzdottrel and lady tailbush  but are in turn played upon by
the chief intriguer  wittipol  with his friend manly  jonson s moral
purpose is here plainly visible  especially in contrast to plautus 
with whom the youthful intriguer is also the stock figure  the motive
of the young man s trickery in the latin comedy is usually unworthy and
selfish  that of wittipol  on the other hand  is wholly disinterested 
since he is represented as having already philosophically accepted the
rejection of his advances at the hands of mrs  fitzdottrel 

in construction the play suffers from overabundance of material 
instead of a single main line of action  which is given clear
precedence  there is rather a succession of elaborated episodes 
carefully connected and motivated  but not properly subordinated  the
plot is coherent and intricate rather than unified  this is further
aggravated by the fact that the chief objects of satire are imperfectly
understood by readers of the present day 

jonson observes unity of time  pug coming to earth in
the morning and returning at midnight  with the exception
of the first scene  which is indeterminate  and seems at
one moment to be hell  and the next london  the action is
confined to the city  but hovers between lincoln s inn 
newgate  and the house of lady tailbush  unity of action
is of course broken by the interference of the devil plot and
the episodic nature of the satirical plot  the main lines
of action may be discussed separately 

in the first act chief prominence is given to the intrigue
between wittipol and mrs  fitzdottrel  this interest is
continued through the second act  but practically dropped
after this point  in act   we find that both lovers have
recovered from their infatuation  and the intrigue ends by
mutual consent 

the second act opens with the episode of merecraft s plot to gull
fitzdottrel  the project of the dukedom of drownedland is given chief
place  and attention is centred upon it both here and in the following
scenes  little use  however  is made of it in the motivation of
action  this is left for another project  the office of the master of
dependencies  quarrels  in the next act  this device is introduced in
an incidental way  and we are not prepared for the important place
which it takes in the development of the plot  merecraft  goaded by
everill  hits upon it merely as a temporary makeshift to extort money
from fitzdottrel  the latter determines to make use of the office in
prosecuting his quarrel with wittipol  in preparation for the duel 
and in accordance with the course of procedure laid down by everill 
he resolves to settle his estate  merecraft and everill endeavor to
have the deed drawn in their own favor  but through the interference
of wittipol the whole estate is made over to manly  who restores it to
mrs  fitzdottrel  this project becomes then the real turning point of
the play 

the episode of guilthead and plutarchus in act   is only slightly
connected with the main plot  that of wittipol s disguise as a spanish
lady  touched upon in the first two acts  becomes the chief interest of
the fourth  it furnishes much comic material  and the characters of
lady tailbush and lady eitherside offer the poet the opportunity for
some of his cleverest touches in characterization and contrast      the
scene  however  is introduced for incidental purposes  the satirization
of foreign fashions and the follies of london society  and is
overelaborated  the catalogue of cosmetics is an instance of jonson s
intimate acquaintance with recondite knowledge standing in the way of
his art 

merecraft s  after game  in the fifth act is of the nature of an
appendix  the play might well have ended with the frustration of his
plan to get possession of the estate  this act is introduced chiefly
for the sake of a satire upon pretended demoniacs and witch finders  it
also contains the conclusion of the devil plot 

 the devil is an ass  will always remain valuable as a historical
document  and as a record of jonson s own attitude towards the abuses
of his times  in the treatment of fitzdottrel and merecraft among the
chief persons  and of plutarchus guilthead among the lesser  this
play belongs to jonson s character drama      it does not  however 
belong to the pure humor comedy  like  the alchemist   and in marked
contrast to  every man out of his humor   interest is sought in plot
development  in the scene between lady tailbush and lady eitherside 
the play becomes a comedy of manners  and in its attack upon state
abuses it is semi political in nature  both gifford and swinburne have
observed the ethical treatment of the main motives 

with the exception of prologue and epilogue  the doggerel couplets
spoken by iniquity  wittipol s song             and some of the
lines quoted by fitzdottrel in the last scene  the play is written
in blank verse throughout  occasional lines of eight             
nine            twelve            or thirteen             syllables
are introduced  most of these could easily be normalized by a slight
emendation or the slurring of a syllable in pronunciation  many of
the lines  however  are rough and difficult of scansion  most of the
dialogue is vigorous  though wittipol s language is sometimes affected
and unnatural  cf  act    sc      his speech                 is
classical in tone  but fragmentary and not perfectly assimilated  the
song already referred to possesses delicacy and some beauty of imagery 
but lacks jonson s customary polish and smoothness 

as a work of art the play must rely chiefly upon the vigor of its
satiric dialogue and the cleverness of its character sketches  it lacks
the chief excellences of construction  unity of interest  subordination
of detail  steady and uninterrupted development  and prompt conclusion 

     woodbridge   studies   p     

     contrasted companion characters are a favorite device with
jonson  compare corvino  corbaccio  and voltore in  the fox   ananias
and tribulation wholesome in  the alchemist   etc 

     it should be noticed that in the case of merecraft the method
employed is the caricature of a profession  as well as the exposition
of personality 


    chief sources of the plot 

the first source to be pointed out was that of act    sc          
this was again noticed by koeppel  who mentions one of the
word for word borrowings  and points out the moralistic tendency in
jonson s treatment of the husband  and his rejection of the italian
story s licentious conclusion      the original is from boccaccio s
 decameron   the fifth novella of the third day  boccaccio s title
is as follows   il zima dona a messer francesco vergellesi un suo
pallafreno  e per quello con licenzia di lui parla alla sua donna  ed
ella tacendo  egli in persona di lei si risponde  e secondo la sua
risposta poi l effetto segue   the substance of the story is this  il
zima  with the bribe of a palfrey  makes a bargain with francesco  for
the gift he is granted an interview with the wife of francesco and in
the latter s presence  this interview  however  unlike that in  the
devil is an ass   is not in the husband s hearing  to guard against any
mishap  francesco secretly commands his wife to make no answer to the
lover  warning her that he will be on the lookout for any communication
on her part  the wife  like mrs  fitzdottrel  upbraids her husband 
but is obliged to submit  il zima begins his courtship  but  though
apparently deeply affected  she makes no answer  the young man then
suspects the husband s trick  e poscia s incominci  ad accorgere dell 
arte usata dal cavaliere   he accordingly hits upon the device of
supposing himself in her place and makes an answer for her  granting an
assignation  as a signal he suggests the hanging out of the window of
two handkerchiefs  he then answers again in his own person  upon the
husband s rejoining them he pretends to be deeply chagrined  complains
that he has met a statue of marble  una statua di marmo  and adds 
 voi avete comperato il pallafreno  e io non l ho venduto   il zima is
successful in his ruse  and francesco s wife yields completely to his
seduction 

a close comparison of this important source is highly instructive 
verbal borrowings show either that jonson had the book before him  or
that he remembered many of the passages literally  thus boccaccio s
 una statua di marmo  finds its counterpart in a later scene     where
mrs  fitzdottrel says   i would not haue him thinke hee met a statue  
fitzdottrel s satisfaction at the result of the bargain is like that
of francesco   i ha  kept the contract  and the cloake is mine   omai
  ben mio il pallafreno  che fu tuo   again wittipol s parting words
resemble il zima s   it may fall out  that you ha  bought it deare 
though i ha  not sold it       in the mouths of the two heroes 
however  these words mean exactly opposite things  with il zima it is a
complaint  and means   you have won the cloak  but i have got nothing
in return   with wittipol  on the other hand  it is an open sneer  and
hints at further developments  the display of handkerchiefs at the
window is another borrowing  fitzdottrel says sarcastically 

                       i ll take carefull order 
    that shee shall hang forth ensignes at the window 

finally wittipol  like il zima  suspects a trick when mrs 
fitzdottrel refuses to answer 

    how  not any word  nay  then  i taste a tricke in t 

but precisely here jonson blunders badly  in boccaccio s story the
trick was a genuine one  il zima stands waiting for an answer  when no
response is made he begins to suspect the husband s secret admonition 
and to thwart it hits upon the device of answering himself  but in
jonson there is no trick at all  fitzdottrel does indeed require his
wife to remain silent  but by no means secretly  his command is placed
in the midst of a rambling discourse addressed alternately to his wife
and to the young men  there is not the slightest hint that any part
of this speech is whispered in his wife s ear  and wittipol enters
upon his courtship with full knowledge of the situation  this fact
deprives wittipol s speech in the person of mrs  fitzdottrel of its
character as a clever device  so that the whole point of boccaccio s
story is weakened  if not destroyed  i cannot refrain in conclusion
from making a somewhat doubtful conjecture  it is noticeable that while
jonson follows so many of the details of this story with the greatest
fidelity he substitutes the gift of a cloak for that of the original
 pallafreno   palfrey       the word is usually written  palafreno  and
so occurs in florio  is it possible that jonson was unfamiliar with the
word  and  not being able to find it in a dictionary  conjectured that
it was identical with  palla   a cloak 

in other respects jonson s handling of the story displays his
characteristic methods  boccaccio spends very few words in description
of either husband or suitor  jonson  however  is careful to make plain
the despicable character of fitzdottrel  while wittipol is represented
as an attractive and high minded young man  further than this  both
mrs  fitzdottrel and wittipol soon recover completely from their
infatuation 

koeppel has suggested a second source from the  decameron   day   
novella    the title is   sotto spezie di confessione e di purissima
coscienza una donna  innamorata d un giovane  induce un solenne frate 
senza avvedersene egli  a dar modo che l piacer di lei avessi intero
effetto   the story is briefly this  a lady makes her confessor the
means of establishing an acquaintance with a young man with whom she
has fallen in love  her directions are conveyed to him under the guise
of indignant prohibitions  by a series of messages of similar character
she finally succeeds in informing him of the absence of her husband
and the possibility of gaining admittance to her chamber by climbing a
tree in the garden  thus the friar becomes the unwitting instrument of
the very thing which he is trying to prevent  so in act    sc    and   
mrs  fitzdottrel suspects pug of being her husband s spy  she dares not
therefore send wittipol a direct message  but requests him to cease his
attentions to her

    at the gentlemans chamber window in  lincolnes inne  there 
    that opens to my gallery 

wittipol takes the hint  and promptly appears at the place indicated 

von rapp     has mentioned certain other scenes as probably of
italian origin  but  as he advances no proofs  his suggestions may be
neglected  it seems to me possible that in the scene above referred
to  where the lover occupies a house adjoining that of his mistress 
and their secret amour is discovered by her servant and reported to
his master  jonson had in mind the same incident in plautus   miles
gloriosus   act     sc    f 

the trait of jealousy which distinguishes fitzdottrel was suggested
to some extent by the character of euclio in the  aulularia   and a
passage of considerable length     is freely paraphrased from that
play  the play and the passage had already been used in  the case is
altered  

miss woodbridge has noticed that the scene in which lady tailbush and
her friends entertain wittipol disguised as a spanish lady is similar
to act    sc    of  the silent woman   where the collegiate ladies call
upon epicoene  the trick of disguising a servant as a woman occurs in
plautus   casina   acts   and   

for the final scene  where fitzdottrel plays the part of a bewitched
person  jonson made free use of contemporary books and tracts  the
motive of pretended possession had already appeared in  the fox 
  wks            where symptoms identical with or similar to those in
the present passage are mentioned  swelling of the belly  vomiting
crooked pins  staring of the eyes  and foaming at the mouth  the
immediate suggestion in this place may have come either through the
rush story or through machiavelli s novella  that jonson s materials
can be traced exclusively to any one source is hardly to be expected 
not only were trials for witchcraft numerous  but they must have formed
a common subject of speculation and discussion  the ordinary evidences
of possession were doubtless familiar to the well informed man without
the need of reference to particular records  and it is of the ordinary
evidences that the poet chiefly makes use  nearly all these are found
repeatedly in the literature of the period 

we know  on the other hand  that jonson often preferred to get his
information through the medium of books  it is not surprising 
therefore  that merecraft proposes to imitate  little darrel s tricks  
and to find that the dramatist has resorted in large measure to this
particular source     

the darrel controversy was carried on through a number of years between
john darrel  a clergyman  see note           on the one hand  and
bishop samuel harsnet  john deacon and john walker  on the other  of
the tracts produced in this controversy the two most important are
harsnet s  discovery of the fraudulent practises of john darrel      
      and darrel s  true narration of the strange and grevous
vexation by the devil of   persons in lancashire and william somers
of nottingham             the story is retold in francis hutchinson s
 historical essay concerning witchcraft   london       

jonson follows the story as told in these two books with considerable
fidelity  the accompaniments of demonic possession which fitzdottrel
exhibits in the last scene are enumerated in two previous speeches 
practically all of these are to be found in darrel s account 

                   roule but wi  your eyes 
    and foam at th  mouth   text

    and your eyes turne  to foame  to stare  to gnash
    your teeth together  and to beate your selfe 
    laugh loud  and faine six voices            f  

they may be compared with the description given by darrel   he was
often seene     to beate his head and other parts of his body against
the ground and bedstead  in most of his fitts  he did swell in his
body      if he were standing when the fit came he wold be cast
headlong upon the ground  or fall doune  drawing then his lips awry 
gnashing with his teeth  wallowing and foaming     presently after he
would laughe loud and shrill  his mouth being shut close    darrel 
p         he was also continually torne in very fearfull manner  and
disfigured in his face     now he gnashed with his teeth  now he fomed
like to the horse or boare      not to say anything of his fearfull
staring with his eyes  and incredible gaping    darrel  p        the
swelling  foaming  gnashing  staring  etc   are also mentioned by
harsnet  pp          as well as the jargon of languages  p

  detection   p        narration   p        finally the clapping of the
hands  text            is a common feature   narration   p        the
last mentioned passage finds a still closer parallel in a couplet from
the contemporary ballad  which gifford quotes from hutchinson  p       

    and by the clapping of his hands
    he shew d the starching of our bands 

of the apparatus supplied by merecraft for the imposture  the soap 
nutshell  tow  and touchwood  text              the bladders and
bellows  text             some are doubtless taken from harsnet s
 discovery   though darrel does not quote these passages in the
 detection   we find  however  that darrel was accused of supplying
somers with black lead to foam with   detection   p        and gifford
says that the  soap  and  bellows  are also mentioned in the  bishop s
book  

though jonson drew so largely upon this source  many details are
supplied by his own imagination  ridiculous as much of it may seem to
the modern reader  it is by no means overdrawn  in fact it may safely
be affirmed that no such realistic depiction of witchcraft exists
elsewhere in the whole range of dramatic literature

library  my knowledge of its contents is derived wholly from

ridiculous discours  of samuel harshnet  entituled  a discoverie

kindness of professor george l  burr from the cornell library  the
quotations from harsnet in the following pages are accordingly taken
from the excerpts in the  detection  


    prototypes of the leading characters 

the position of the leading characters has already been indicated  pug 
as the comic butt and innocent gull  is allied to master stephen and
master matthew of  every man in his humor   dapper of  the alchemist  
and cokes of  bartholomew fair   fitzdottrel  another type of the gull 
is more closely related to  tribulation wholesome  in  the alchemist  
and even in some respects to corvino and voltore in  the fox   wittipol
and manly  the chief intriguers  hold approximately the same position
as wellbred and knowell in  every man in his humor   winwife and
quarlous in  bartholomew fair   and dauphine  clerimont  and truewit in
 the silent woman   merecraft is related in his character of swindler
to subtle in  the alchemist   and in his character of projector to sir
politick wouldbe in  the fox  

the contemptible  lady of spirit and woman of fashion  is one of
jonson s favorite types  she first appears in the persons of fallace
and saviolina in  every man out of his humor   then in  cynthia s
revels   where moria and her friends play the part  then as cytheris in
 poetaster   lady politick in  the alchemist   the collegiate ladies
in  the silent woman   and fulvia and sempronia in  catiline   the same
affectations and vices are satirized repeatedly  an evident prototype
of justice eitherside is found in the person of adam overdo in
 bartholomew fair   both are justices of the peace  both are officious 
puritanical  and obstinate  justice eitherside s denunciation of the
devotees of tobacco finds its counterpart in a speech in  bartholomew
fair   and his repeated  i do detest it  reminds one of overdo s
frequent expressions of horror at the enormities which he constantly
discovers 


    minor sources 

 the devil is an ass  is not deeply indebted to the classics  jonson
borrows twice from horace             and          f  the half dozen
lines in which the former passage occurs                 are written in
evident imitation of the horatian style  two passages are also borrowed
from plautus            f   already mentioned  and             a single
passage            f   shows the influence of martial  these passages
are all quoted in the notes 

the source of wittipol s description of the  cioppino   and the mishap
attendant upon its use  was probably taken from a contemporary book
of travels  a passage in coryat s  crudities  furnishes the necessary
information and a similar anecdote  and was doubtless used by jonson
 see note            coryat was patronized by the poet  similarly 
another passage in the  crudities  seems to have suggested the project
of the forks  see note           

a curious resemblance is further to be noted between several passages
in  the devil is an ass  and  underwoods      the first draft of this
poem may have been written not long before the present play  see fleay 
 chron              and so have been still fresh in the poet s mind 
the passage  da              shows unmistakably that the play was
the borrower  and not the poem  gifford suggests that both passages
were quoted from a contemporary posture book  but the passage in the
epigram gives no indication of being a quotation 

the chief parallels are as follows   u             and  da        
        u            and  da                  u            and  da     
          u            and  da                these passages are all
quoted in the notes  in addition  there are a few striking words and
phrases that occur in both productions  but the important likenesses
are all noted above  in no other poem except  charis    the gipsies  
and  underwoods          where the borrowings are unmistakably
intentional  is there any thing like the same reworking of material as
in this instance 




iii  specific objects of satire


 the devil is an ass  has been called of all jonson s plays since
 cynthia s revels  the most obsolete in the subjects of its satire     
the criticism is true  and it is only with some knowledge of the abuses
which jonson assails that we can appreciate the keenness and precision
of his thrusts  the play is a colossal expos  of social abuses  it
attacks the aping of foreign fashions  the vices of society  and above
all the cheats and impositions of the unscrupulous swindler  but we
miss its point if we fail to see that jonson s arraignment of the
society which permitted itself to be gulled is no less severe than that
of the swindler who practised upon its credulity  three institutions
especially demand an explanation both for their own sake and for their
bearing upon the plot  these are the duello  the monopoly  and the
pretended demoniacal possession 

     see introduction  section c  iv 

     swinburne  p     


    the duello 

the origin of private dueling is a matter of some obscurity  it was
formerly supposed to be merely a development of the judicial duel or
combat  but this is uncertain  dueling flourished on the continent 
and was especially prevalent in france during the reign of henry iii 
jonson speaks of the frequency of the practice in france in  the
magnetic lady  

no private duel seems to have occurred in england before the sixteenth
century  and the custom was comparatively rare until the reign of
james i  its introduction was largely due to the substitution of the
rapier for the broadsword  not long after this change in weapons
fencing schools began to be established and were soon very popular 
donald lupton  in his  london and the countrey carbonadoed        
says they were usually set up by  some low country soldier  who to
keep himself honest from further inconveniences  as also to maintain
himself  thought upon this course and practises it      

the etiquette of the duel was a matter of especial concern  the two
chief authorities seem to have been jerome carranza  the author of a
book entitled  filosofia de las armas       and vincentio saviolo 
whose  practise  was translated into english in       it contained two
parts  the first  intreating of the vse of the rapier and dagger   the
second  of honor and honorable quarrels   the rules laid down in these
books were mercilessly ridiculed by the dramatists  and the duello was
a frequent subject of satire     

by      dueling must have become very common  frequent references
to the subject are found about this time in the  calendar of state
papers   under date of december          we read that all persons who
go abroad to fight duels are to be censured in the star chamber  on
february            a proclamation  with a book annexed   was issued
against duels  and on february           the king made a star chamber
speech against dueling   on which he before published a sharp edict  

the passion for dueling was turned to advantage by a set of improvident
bravos  who styled themselves  sword men  or  masters of dependencies  
a  dependence  being the accepted name for an impending quarrel  these
men undertook to examine into the causes of a duel  and to settle or
 take it up  according to the rules laid down by the authorities on
this subject  their prey were the young men of fashion in the city 
and especially  country gulls   who were newly come to town and
were anxious to become sophisticated  the profession must have been
profitable  for we hear of their methods being employed by the  roaring
boys      and the masters of the fencing schools      fletcher in  the
elder brother    wks            speaks of

               the masters of dependencies
    that by compounding differences  tween others
    supply their own necessities 

and massinger makes similar comment in  the guardian    wks    p      

         when two heirs quarrel 
    the swordsmen of the city shortly after
    appear in plush  for their grave consultations
    in taking up the difference  some  i know 
    make a set living on t 

another function of the office is mentioned by ford in  fancies chaste
and noble    wks           the master would upon occasion  brave  a
quarrel with the novice for the sake of  gilding his reputation   and
massinger in  the maid of honor    wks    p       asserts that he would
even consent  for a cloak with thrice died velvet  and a cast suit  to
be  kick d down the stairs   in  a king and no king   b    fl    wks  
       f   bessus consults with two of these  gentlemen of the sword 
in a ridiculous scene  in which the sword men profess the greatest
scrupulousness in examining every word and phrase  affirming that they
cannot be  too subtle in this business  

jonson never loses an opportunity of satirizing these despicable
bullies  who were not only ridiculous in their affectations  but who
proved by their  fomenting bloody quarrels  to be no small danger
to the state  bobadill  who is described as a paul s man  was in
addition a pretender to this craft  matthew complains that downright
has threatened him with the bastinado  whereupon bobadill cries out
immediately that it is  a most proper and sufficient dependence  and
adds   come hither  you shall chartel him  i ll shew you a trick or
two  you shall kill him with at pleasure       cavalier shift  in
 every man out of his humor   among various other occupations has the
reputation of being able to  manage a quarrel the best that ever you
saw  for terms and circumstances   we have an excellent picture of
the ambitious novice in the person of kastrill in  the alchemist  
kastrill  who is described as an  angry boy   comes to consult subtle
as to how to  carry a business  manage a quarrel fairly   face assures
him that dr  subtle is able to  take the height  of any quarrel
whatsoever  to tell  in what degree of safety it lies    how it may be
borne   etc 

from this description of the  master of dependencies  the exquisite
humor of the passage in  the devil is an ass            f   can be
appreciated  merecraft assures fitzdottrel that this occupation  in
reality the refuge only of the shifts and bobadills of the city  is a
new and important office about to be formally established by the state 
in spite of all their speaking against dueling  he says  they have
come to see the evident necessity of a public tribunal to which all
quarrels may be referred  it is by means of this pretended office that
merecraft attempts to swindle fitzdottrel out of his entire estate 
from which disaster he is saved only by the clever interposition of
wittipol

    the monopoly system 

jonson s severest satire in  the devil is an ass  is directed against
the projector  through him the whole system of monopolies is indirectly
criticised  to understand the importance and timeliness of this attack 
as well as the poet s own attitude on the subject  it is necessary to
give a brief historical discussion of the system as it had developed
and then existed 

royal grants with the avowed intention of instructing the english in
a new industry had been made as early as the fourteenth century     
and the system had become gradually modified during the tudor dynasty 
in the sixteenth century a capitalist middle class rose to wealth and
political influence  during the reign of elizabeth a large part of
cecil s energies was directed toward the economic development of the
country  this was most effectually accomplished by granting patents to
men who had enterprise enough to introduce a new art or manufacture 
whether an importation from a foreign country or their own invention 
the capitalist was encouraged to make this attempt by the grant of
special privileges of manufacture for a limited period      the
condition of monopoly did not belong to the mediaeval system  but was
first introduced under elizabeth  so far the system had its economic
justification  but unfortunately it did not stop here  abuses began to
creep in  not only the manufacture  but the exclusive trade in certain
articles  was given over to grantees  and commodities of the most
common utility were  ingrossed into the hands of these blood suckers
of the commonwealth      a remonstrance of parliament was made to
elizabeth in       and again in       and in consequence the queen
thought best to promise the annulling of all monopolies then existing 
a promise which she in large measure fulfilled  but the immense growth
of commerce under elizabeth made it necessary for her successor  james
i   to establish a system of delegation  and he accordingly adapted
the system of granting patents to the existing needs      many new
monopolies were granted during the early years of his reign  but in
     parliament again protested  and he followed elizabeth s example by
revoking them all  after the suspension of parliamentary government in
     the system grew up again  and the old abuses became more obnoxious
than ever  in      parliament addressed a second remonstrance to james 
the king professed ignorance  but promised redress  and in      all the
existing monopolies were abolished by the statute    james i  c     in
parliament s address to james  the tender point of prerogative  was
not disturbed  and it was contrived that all the blame and punishment
should fall on the patentees     

of all the patents granted during this time  that which seems to have
most attracted the attention of the dramatists was one for draining the
fens of lincolnshire  similar projects had frequently been attempted
during the sixteenth century  in the list of patents before      
catalogued by hulme  seven deal with water drainage in some form or
other  the low lands on the east coast of england are exposed to
inundation      during the roman occupation large embankments had been
built  and during the middle ages these had been kept up partly through
a commission appointed by the crown  and partly through the efforts of
the monasteries at ramsey and crowland  after the dissolution of these
monasteries it became necessary to take up anew the work of reclaiming
the fen land  an abortive attempt by the earl of lincoln had already
been made when the statute    eliz  c          was passed in the year
      this made legal the action of projectors in the recovery of marsh
land  many difficulties  however  such as lack of funds and opposition
on the part of the inhabitants and neighbors of the fens  still stood
in their way  in      sir john popham and sir thomas fleming headed a
company which undertook to drain the great level of the cambridgeshire
fens  consisting of more than         acres  at their own cost  on the
understanding that         acres of the reclaimed land should fall
to their share  the project was a complete failure  another statute
granting a patent for draining the fens is found in the seventh year of
jac  i  c      and the attempt was renewed from time to time throughout
the reigns of james and charles i  it was not  however  until the
restoration that these efforts were finally crowned with success 

when the remonstrance was made to james in       the object of the
petitioners was gained  as we have seen  by throwing all the blame upon
the patentees and projectors  similarly  the dramatists often prefer
to make their attack  not by assailing the institution of monopolies 
but by ridicule of the offending subjects      two agents are regularly
distinguished  there is the patentee  sometimes also called the
projector  whose part it is to supply the funds for the establishment
of the monopoly  and  if possible  the necessary influence at court 
and the actual projector or inventor  who undertakes to furnish his
patron with various projects of his own device 

jonson s is probably the earliest dramatic representation of the
projector  merecraft is a swindler  pure and simple  whose schemes are
directed not so much against the people whom he aims to plunder by the
establishment of a monopoly as against the adventurer who furnishes
the funds for putting the project into operation 

                   wee poore gentlemen  that want acres 
    must for our needs  turne fooles vp and plough  ladies  

both fitzdottrel and lady tailbush are drawn into these schemes so
far as to part with their money  merecraft himself pretends that he
possesses sufficient influence at court  he flatters fitzdottrel  who
is persuaded by the mere display of projects in a buckram bag  by
demanding of him  his count nance  t appeare in t to great men 
            lady tailbush is not so easily fooled  and merecraft has
some difficulty in persuading her of the power of his friends at court
 act    sc     

merecraft s chief project  the recovery of the drowned lands  is also
satirized by randolph 

    i have a rare device to set dutch windmills

    witchcraft 

witchcraft in jonson s time was not an outworn belief  but a living
issue  it is remarkable that the persecutions which followed upon this
terrible delusion were comparatively infrequent during the middle
ages  and reached their maximum only in the seventeenth century 

the first english act against witchcraft after the norman conquest was
passed in          hen  viii  c      this act  which was of a general
nature  and directed against various kinds of sorceries  was followed
by another in         eliz  c       at the accession of james i  in
     was passed   jac  i  c      which continued law for more than a
century 

during this entire period charges of witchcraft were frequent  in
scotland they were especially numerous  upwards of fifty being recorded
during the years             the trial of anne turner in       in
which charges of witchcraft were joined with those of poisoning 
especially attracted the attention of jonson  in      occurred the
trial of the  three witches of warboys   in      that of mary smith 
in      that of the earlier lancashire witches  and of the later
in       these are only a few of the more famous cases  of no less
importance in this connection is the attitude of the king himself 
in the famous  demonology      he allied himself unhesitatingly with
the cause of superstition  witchcraft was of course not without
its opponents  but these were for the most part obscure men and of
little personal influence  while bacon and raleigh were inclining
to a belief in witchcraft  and sir thomas browne was offering his
support to persecution  the cause of reason was intrusted to such
champions as reginald scot  the author of the famous  discovery of
witchcraft         a work which fearlessly exposes the prevailing
follies and crimes  it is on this side that jonson places himself  that
he should make a categorical statement as to his belief or disbelief
in witchcraft is not to be expected  it is enough that he presents
a picture of the pretended demoniac  that he makes it as sordid and
hateful as possible  that he draws for us in the person of justice
eitherside the portrait of the bigoted  unreasonable  and unjust judge 
and that he openly ridicules the series of cases which he used as the
source of his witch scenes  cf  act     sc     

to form an adequate conception of the poet s satirical purpose in
this play one should compare the methods used here with the treatment
followed in jonson s other dramas where the witch motive occurs 
in  the masque of queens         and in  the sad shepherd   jonson
employed the lore of witchcraft more freely  but in a quite different
way  here  instead of hard realism with all its hideous details  the
more picturesque beliefs and traditions are used for purely imaginative
and poetical purposes 

 the masque of queens  was presented at whitehall  and dedicated to
prince henry  naturally jonson s attitude toward witchcraft would here
be respectful  it is to be observed  however  that in the copious notes
which are appended to the masque no contemporary trials are referred
to  the poet relies upon the learned compilations of bodin  remigius 
cornelius agrippa  and paracelsus  together with many of the classical
authors  he is clearly dealing with the mythology of witchcraft 
nightshade and henbane  sulphur  vapors  the eggshell boat  and the
cobweb sail are the properties which he uses in this poetic drama 
the treatment does not differ essentially from that of middleton and
shakespeare 

in  the sad shepherd  the purpose is still different  we have none of
the wild unearthliness of the masque  maudlin is a witch of a decidedly
vulgar type  but there is no satirical intent  jonson  for the purpose
of his play  accepts for the moment the prevailing attitude toward
witchcraft  and the satisfaction in maudlin s discomfiture doubtless
assumed an acquiescence in the popular belief  at the same time the
poetical aspect is not wholly forgotten  and appears with especial
prominence in the beautiful passage which describes the witch s forest
haunt  beginning   within a gloomy dimble she doth dwell    the sad
shepherd  and the masque are far more akin to each other in their
treatment of witchcraft than is either to  the devil is an ass

iv  personal satire


the detection of personal satire in jonson s drama is difficult 
and at best unsatisfactory  jonson himself always resented it as an
impertinence      in the present case fleay suggests that the motto 
 ficta  voluptatis causa  sint proxima veris   is an indication that we
are to look upon the characters as real persons  but jonson twice took
the pains to explain that this is precisely the opposite of his own
interpretation of horace s meaning      the subject of personal satire
was a favorite one with him  and in  the magnetic lady  he makes the
sufficiently explicit statement   a play  though it apparel and present
vices in general  flies from all particularities in persons  

on the other hand we know that jonson did occasionally indulge in
personal satire  carlo buffone      antonio balladino      and the
clerk nathaniel     are instances sufficiently authenticated  of these
jonson advances a plea of justification   where have i been particular 
where personal  except to a mimic  cheater  bawd or buffoon  creatures 
for their insolencies  worthy to be taxed  yet to which of these so
pointingly  as he might not either ingenuously have confest  or wisely
dissembled his disease      

in only one play do we know that the principal characters represent
real people  but between  poetaster  and  the devil is an ass  there
is a vast difference of treatment  in  poetaster      the attitude is
undisguisedly satirical  the allusions in the prologues and notices
to the reader are direct and unmistakable      the character drawing
is partly caricature  partly allegorical  this method is easily
distinguishable from the typical  which aims to satirize a class 
    jonson does not draw upon historical events  but personal
idiosyncrasies      the chief motive is in the spirit of aristophanes 
the great master of personal satire  these methods are what we should
naturally expect in a composition of this sort  of such internal
evidence we find little or nothing in  the devil is an ass   several
plausible identifications  however  have been proposed  and these we
must consider separately 

the chief characters are identified by fleay as follows  wittipol is
jonson  he has returned from travel  and had seen mrs  fitzdottrel
before he went  mrs  fitzdottrel is the lady elizabeth hatton 
fitzdottrel is her husband  sir edward coke 

 mrs  fitzdottrel   the identification is based upon a series of
correspondences between a passage in  the devil is an ass        
        and a number of passages scattered through jonson s works  the
most important of these are quoted in the note to the above passage  to
them has been added an important passage from  a challenge at tilt  
      fleay s deductions are these       underwoods     and  charis 
must be addressed to the same lady  cf  especially  ch    part        
charis and mrs  fitzdottrel are identical  the song           f   is
found complete in the  celebration of charis   in wittipol s preceding
speech we find the phrases  milk and roses  and  bank of kisses   which
occur in  charis  and in  u       and a reference to the husband who
is the  just excuse  for the wife s infidelity  which occurs in  u 
         charis is lady hatton  fleay believes that  charis   part
   in which the poet speaks of himself as writing  fifty years   was
written c         but that parts      were written c       in reference
to these parts he says   written in reference to a mask in which
charis represented venus riding in a chariot drawn by swans and doves
  charis   part     at a marriage  and leading the graces in a dance
at whitehall  worthy to be envied of the queen      in which cupid had
a part            at which charis kissed him         and afterwards
kept up a close intimacy with him             the mask of       feb 
   exactly fulfils these conditions  and the venus of that mask was
probably l  elizabeth hatton  the most beautiful of the then court
ladies  she had appeared in the mask of beauty        jan      but
in no other year traceable by me  from the elegy  g      manifestly
written to the same lady  compare it with the lines in   as to  the
bank of kisses  and  the bath of milk and roses    we learn that charis
had  a husband that is the just excuse of all that can be done him  
this was her second husband  sir edward coke  to whom she was married
in       

fleay s theory rests chiefly upon     his interpretation of  the
celebration of claris       the identity of charis and mrs 
fitzdottrel  a study of the poem has led me to conclusions of a very
different nature from those of fleay  they may be stated as follows 

 charis     this was evidently written in         jonson plainly says 
 though i now write fifty years   charis is here seemingly identified
with lady purbeck  daughter of lady hatton  compare the last two lines
with the passage from  the gipsies   fleay believes the compliments
were transferred in the masque at lady hatton s request 

 charis    and   have every mark of being insertions      they are in
different metres from each other and from the other sections  which in
this respect are uniform      they are not in harmony with the rest of
the poem  they entirely lack the easy  familiar  half jocular style
which characterizes the eight other parts      each is a somewhat
ambitious effort  complete in itself  and distinctly lyrical      in
neither is there any mention of or reference to charis      it is
evident  therefore  that they were not written for the  charis  poem 
but merely interpolated  they are  then  of all the parts the least
valuable for the purpose of identification  nor are we justified in
looking upon them as continuing a definite narrative with the rest of
the poem      the evident reason for introducing them is their own
intrinsic lyrical merit 

 charis    was apparently written in praise of some pageant  probably a
court masque  the representation of venus drawn in a chariot by swans
and doves  the birds sacred to her  may have been common enough  that
this is an accurate description of the masque of february         is 
however  a striking fact  and it is possible that the lady referred
to is the same who represented venus in that masque  but     we do
not even know that jonson refers to a masque of his own  or a masque
at all      we have no trustworthy evidence that lady hatton was the
venus of that masque  fleay s identification is little better than a
guess      evidence is derived from the first stanza alone  this does
not appear in  the devil is an ass   and probably was not written at
the time  otherwise there is no reason for its omission in that place 
it seems to have been added for the purpose of connecting the lyric
interpolation with the rest of the poem 

 charis    seems to be a late production      jonson combines in this
single section a large number of figures used in other places     
that it was not the origin of these figures seems to be intimated by
the words of the poem  cupid is talking  he had lately found jonson
describing his lady  and jonson s words  he says  are descriptive of
cupid s own mother  venus  so homer had spoken of her hair  so anacreon
of her face  he continues 

    by her looks i do her know
     which you call  my shafts 

the italicized words may refer to  u            they correspond 
however  much more closely to  challenge      cup   the  bath your
verse discloses   l      may refer to  da                u          
or  gipsies       

                   the bank of kisses 
    where  you say  men gather blisses

is mentioned in  u              the passages in  da   and  gipsies     
are less close  the  valley  called  my nest  may be a reference to
 da            f  jonson had already spoken of the  girdle  bout her
waist  in  challenge      cup    charis    seems then to have been
written later than  u        challenge         and probably  devil is
an ass         the evidence is strong  though not conclusive 

 charis    evidently refers to a marriage at whitehall  that cupid  who
is referred to in          had any part in the marriage of  charis   
is nowhere even intimated  that charis led the graces in a dance is
a conjecture equally unfounded  jonson of course takes the obvious
opportunity  ll          of playing on the name charis  that this
occasion was the same as that celebrated in   we have no reason to
believe  it applies equally well  for instance  to  a challenge at
tilt   but we are by no means justified in so limiting it  it may have
been imaginary 

 charis    was written before       since jonson quoted a part of it to
drummond during his visit in scotland  cf   conversations      it was
a favorite of the poet s and this furnishes sufficient reason for its
insertion here  it is worthy of note that the two sections of  charis  
which we know by external proof to have been in existence before      
are those which give internal evidence of being interpolations 

 summary   the poem was probably a late production and of composite
nature  there is no reason for supposing that the greater part was not
written in         the fourth and seventh parts are interpolations 
the first stanza of the fourth part  upon which the identification
largely rests  seems not to have been written until the poem was put
together in         if it was written at the same time as the other
two stanzas  we cannot expect to find it forming part of a connected
narrative  the events described in the fourth and sixth parts are not
necessarily the same  there is practically no evidence that lady hatton
was the venus of       or that  charis  is addressed to any particular
lady 

the other link in fleay s chain of evidence is of still weaker
substance  the mere repetition of compliments does not necessarily
prove the recipient to be the same person  in fact we find in these
very pieces the same phrases applied indiscriminately to lady purbeck 
lady frances howard  mrs  fitzdottrel  perhaps to lady hatton  and even
to the earl of somerset  of what value  then  can such evidence be 

fleay s whole theory rests on this poem  and biographical evidence is
unnecessary  it is sufficient to notice that lady hatton was a proud
woman  that marriage with so eminent a man as sir edward coke was
considered a great condescension   chamberlain s letters   camden soc  
p       and that an amour with jonson is extremely improbable 

 fitzdottrel   fleay s identification of fitzdottrel with coke rests
chiefly on the fact that coke was lady hatton s husband  the following
considerations are added  fitzdottrel is a  squire of norfolk   sir
e  coke was a native of norfolk  and had held office in norwich 
fitzdottrel s r le as sham demoniac is a covert allusion to coke s
adoption of the popular witch doctrines in the overbury trial  his
jealousy of his wife was shown in the same trial  where he refused to
read the document of  what ladies loved what lords   because  as was
popularly supposed  his own wife s name headed the list  jonson is
taking advantage of coke s disgrace in november        he had flattered
him in        u       

our reasons for rejecting this theory are as follows      the natural
inference is that jonson would not deliberately attack the man whom
he had highly praised three years before  i do not understand fleay s
assertion that jonson was always ready to attack the fallen      the
compliment paid to coke in        u       was not the flattery of an
hour of triumph  the appointment to the king s bench was displeasing to
coke  and made at the suggestion of bacon with the object of removing
him to a place where he would come less often into contact with the
king      fitzdottrel is a light headed man of fashion  who spends his
time in frequenting theatres and public places  and in conjuring evil
spirits  coke was sixty four years old  the greatest lawyer of his
time  and a man of the highest gifts and attainments      the attempted
parallel between fitzdottrel  the pretended demoniac  and coke  as
judge in the overbury trial  is patently absurd      if lady hatton had
not been selected for identification with mrs  fitzdottrel  coke would
never have been dreamed of as a possible fitzdottrel 

 wittipol   he is a young man just returned from travel  which
apparently has been of considerable duration  he saw mrs  fitzdottrel
once before he went  and upon returning immediately seeks her out 
how does this correspond to jonson s life   the hue and cry  was
played february          according to fleay s interpretation  this was
followed by an intimacy with lady hatton  five years later  in      
drummond tells us that jonson went to france with the son of sir walter
raleigh  he returned the same year in time to compose  a challenge at
tilt   december     three years later he wrote  the devil is an ass  at
the age of forty three 

wittipol intimates that he is mrs  fitzdottrel s equal in years  in
fashion                and in blood              for jonson to say this
to lady hatton would have been preposterous 

 justice eitherside   only the desire to prove a theory at all costs
could have prevented fleay from seeing that coke s counterpart is
not fitzdottrel  but justice eitherside  in obstinacy  bigotry  and
vanity this character represents the class of judges with which
coke identified himself in the overbury trial  nor are these merely
class traits  they are distinctly the faults which marred coke s career
from the beginning  it is certain that coke is partially responsible
for this portraiture  overbury was a personal friend of the poet  and
the trial  begun in the previous year  had extended into       jonson
must have followed it eagerly  on the other hand  it is improbable that
the picture was aimed exclusively at coke  he merely furnished traits
for a typical and not uncommon character  as we have seen  it is in
line with jonson s usual practise to confine personal satire to the
lesser characters 

 merecraft   fleay s identification with sir giles mompesson has very
little to commend it  mompesson was connected by marriage with james
i  s powerful favorite  george villiers  later duke of buckingham  in
     he suggested to villiers the creation of a special commission for
the purpose of granting licenses to keepers of inns and ale houses 
the suggestion was adopted by villiers  mompesson was appointed to the
commission in october        and knighted on november    of that year 
the patent was not sealed until march        his high handed conduct
soon became unpopular  but he continued in favor with villiers and
james  and his disgrace did not come until      

it will readily be seen that mompesson s position and career conform
in no particular to those of merecraft in the present play  mompesson
was a knight  a friend of the king s favorite  and in favor with
the king  merecraft is a mere needy adventurer without influence at
court  and the associate of ruffians  who frequent the  straits  and
the  bermudas   mompesson was himself the recipient of a patent  see
section iii      merecraft is merely the projector who devises clever
projects for more powerful patrons  mompesson s project bears no
resemblance to those suggested by merecraft  and he could hardly have
attracted any popular dislike at the time when  the devil is an ass 
was presented  since  as we have seen  his patent was not even sealed
until the following year  finally  jonson would hardly have attacked a
man who stood so high at court as did mompesson in      

it is evident that jonson had particularly in mind those projectors
whose object it was to drain the fens of lincolnshire  the attempts  as
we have seen  were numerous  and it is highly improbable that jonson
wished to satirize any one of them more severely than another  in a
single passage  however  it seems possible that sir john popham  see
page lx  is referred to  in act    sc    merecraft speaks of a sir john
monie man as a projector who was able to  jump a business quickly 
because  he had great friends   that popham is referred to seems not
unlikely from the fact that he was the most important personage who
had embarked upon an enterprise of this sort  that his scheme was one
of the earliest  that he was not a strict contemporary  d         and
that his scheme had been very unpopular  this is proved by an anonymous
letter to the king  in which complaint is made that  the  covetous
bloody popham  will ruin many poor men by his offer to drain the fens 
  cal  state papers   mar             

 plutarchus guilthead   fleay s identification with edmund howes i am
prepared to accept  although biographical data are very meagre  fleay
says   plutarchus gilthead  who is writing the lives of the great
men in the city  the captain who writes of the artillery garden  to
train the youth   etc              is  i think  edmond howes  whose
continuation of stow s chronicle was published in       

howes  undertaking was a matter of considerable ridicule to his
acquaintances  in his      edition he speaks of the heavy blows and
great discouragements he received from his friends  he was in the habit
of signing himself  gentleman  and this seems to be satirized in      
where guilthead says repeatedly   this is to make you a gentleman   see
 n    q    st ser           

 the noble house   two proposed identifications of the  noble house  
which pretends to a duke s title  mentioned at             have been
made  the expenditure of much energy in the attempt to fix so veiled
an allusion is hardly worth while  jonson of course depended upon
contemporary rumor  for which we have no data 

cunningham s suggestion that buckingham is referred to is not
convincing  buckingham s father was sir george villiers of brooksby in
leicestershire  he was not himself raised to the nobility until august
          when he was created viscount villiers and baron waddon  it
was not until january          not       as cunningham says   that he
became earl of buckingham  and it is unlikely that before this time
any allusion to villiers  aspiration to a dukedom would have been
intelligible to jonson s audience 

fleay s theory that the  noble house  was that of stuart may be
accepted provisionally  lodowick was made earl of richmond in       and
duke in       he was acceptable to king and people  and in this very
year was made steward of the household

d  after influence of the devil is an ass


a few instances of the subsequent rehandling of certain motives in
this play are too striking to be completely overlooked  john wilson 
     c       a faithful student and close imitator of jonson  produced
in      a drama called  belphegor   or  the marriage of the devil 
a tragi comedy   while it is founded on the english translation of
machiavelli s novella  which appeared in       and closely adheres
to the lines of the original  it shows clear evidence of jonson s
influence  the subject has been fully investigated by hollstein  cf 
 verh ltnis   pp                            

 the cheats         apparently refers to  the devil is an ass  in
the  prologue   the characters of bilboe and titere tu belong to the
same class of low bullies as merecraft and everill  but the evident
prototypes of these characters are subtle and face in  the alchemist  

a third play of wilson s   the projectors         shows unmistakable
influence of  the devil is an ass   the chief object of satire is
of course the same  and the character of sir gudgeon credulous is
modeled after that of fitzdottrel  the scenes in which the projects are
explained       and       are similar to the corresponding passages in
jonson  the  aulularia  of plautus is a partial source  so that the
play in some features resembles  the case is altered   in      wilson
imitates the passage in the  aulularia   which closes act    sc    of

brome  jonson s old servant and friend  also handled the subject of
monopolies  see page lxi   jonson s influence is especially marked in
 the court beggar   the project of perukes   wks           should be
compared with merecraft s project of toothpicks 

mrs  susanna centlivre s  busie body  uses the motives borrowed from
boccaccio  see pp  xlv ff    the scenes in which these appear must have
been suggested by jonson s play  genest          though the author
seems to have been acquainted with the  decameron  also  in act    
sc    sir george airy makes a bargain with sir francis gripe similar
to wittipol s bargain with fitzdottrel  in exchange for the sum of a
hundred guineas he is admitted into the house for the purpose of moving
his suit to miranda   for the space of ten minutes  without lett or
molestation   provided sir francis remain in the same room  though out
of ear shot   d ed   p      in act    sc    the bargain is carried out
in much the same way as in boccaccio and in jonson  miranda remaining
dumb and sir george answering for her 

in act    sc      d ed   p      miranda in the presence of her
guardian sends a message by marplot not to saunter at the garden gate
about eight o clock as he has been accustomed to do  thus making an
assignation with him  compare  da             

other motives which seem to show some influence of  the devil is an
ass  are miranda s trick to have the estate settled upon her  charles 
disguise as a spaniard  and traffick s jealous care of isabinda  the
character of marplot as comic butt resembles that of pug 

the song in  the devil is an ass            see note  was imitated by
sir john suckling 




appendix extracts from the critics


gifford  there is much good writing in this comedy  all the speeches
of satan are replete with the most biting satire  delivered with an
appropriate degree of spirit  fitzdottrel is one of those characters
which jonson delighted to draw  and in which he stood unrivalled  a
 gull   i  e   a confident coxcomb  selfish  cunning  and conceited 
mrs  fitzdottrel possesses somewhat more interest than the generality
of our author s females  and is indeed a well sustained character  in
action the principal amusement of the scene  exclusive of the admirable
burlesque of witchery in the conclusion  was probably derived from the
mortification of poor pug  whose stupid stare of amazement at finding
himself made an  ass  of on every possible occasion must  if portrayed
as some then on the stage were well able to portray it  have been
exquisitely comic 

this play is strictly moral in its conception and conduct  knavery and
folly are shamed and corrected  virtue is strengthened and rewarded 
and the ends of dramatic justice are sufficiently answered by the
simple exposure of those whose errors are merely subservient to the
minor interests of the piece 

herford   studies in the literary relations of england and germany  
pp           jonson had in fact so far the aristophanic quality of
genius  that he was at once a most elaborate and minute student of the
actual world  and a poet of the airiest and boldest fancy  and that he
loved to bring the two r les into the closest possible combination  no
one so capable of holding up the mirror to contemporary society without
distorting the slenderest thread of its complex tissue of usages  no
one  on the other hand  who so keenly delighted in startling away
the illusion or carefully undermining it by some palpably fantastic
invention  his most elaborate reproductions of the everyday world are
hardly ever without an infusion of equally elaborate caprice   a leaven
of recondite and fantastic legend and grotesque myth  redolent of old
libraries and antique scholarship  furtively planted  as it were  in
the heart of that everyday world of london life  and so subtly blending
with it that the whole motley throng of merchants and apprentices 
gulls and gallants  discover nothing unusual in it  and engage with the
most perfectly matter of fact air in the business of working it out 
the purging of crispinus in the  poetaster   the aristophanic motive
of the  magnetic lady   even the farcical horror of noise which is the
mainspring of the  epic ne   are only less elaborate and sustained
examples of this fantastic realism than the adventure of a stupid
devil in the play before us  nothing more anomalous in the london of
jonson s day could be conceived  yet it is so managed that it loses
all its strangeness  so perfectly is the supernatural element welded
with the human  that it almost ceases to appear supernatural  pug  the
hero of the adventure  is a pretty  petulant boy  more human by many
degrees than the half fairy puck of shakespeare  which doubtless helped
to suggest him  and the arch fiend satan is a bluff old politician 
anxious to ward off the perils of london from his young simpleton of a
son  who is equally eager to plunge into them  the old savage horror
fades away before jonson s humanising touch  the infernal world loses
all its privilege of peculiar terror and strength  and sinks to the
footing of a mere rival state  whose merchandise can be kept out of the
market and its citizens put in the counter or carted to tyburn 

a  w  ward   eng  dram  lit    pp          the oddly named comedy
of  the devil is an ass   acted in       seems already to exhibit a
certain degree of decay in the dramatic powers which had so signally
called forth its predecessor  yet this comedy possesses a considerable
literary interest  as adapting both to jonson s dramatic method  and
to the general moral atmosphere of his age  a theme connecting itself
with some of the most notable creations of the earlier elizabethan
drama     the idea of the play is as healthy as its plot is ingenious 
but apart from the circumstance that the latter is rather slow in
preparation  and by no means  i think  gains in perspicuousness as it
proceeds  the design itself suffers from one radical mistake  pug s
intelligence is so much below par that he suffers as largely on account
of his clumsiness as on account of his viciousness  while remaining
absolutely without influence upon the course of the action  the comedy
is at the same time full of humor  particularly in the entire character
of fitzdottrel 

swinburne   study of ben jonson   pp         if  the devil is an ass 
cannot be ranked among the crowning masterpieces of its author  it is
not because the play shows any sign of decadence in literary power or
in humorous invention  the writing is admirable  the wealth of comic
matter is only too copious  the characters are as firm in outline or as
rich in color as any but the most triumphant examples of his satirical
or sympathetic skill in finished delineation and demarcation of humors 
on the other hand  it is of all ben jonson s comedies since the date
of  cynthia s revels  the most obsolete in subject of satire  the most
temporary in its allusions and applications  the want of fusion or even
connection  except of the most mechanical or casual kind  between the
various parts of its structure and the alternate topics of its ridicule
makes the action more difficult to follow than that of many more
complicated plots  and  finally  the admixture of serious sentiment and
noble emotion is not so skilfully managed as to evade the imputation of
incongruity   the dialogue between lady tailbush and lady eitherside
in act    sc    has some touches  worthy of moli re himself   in act
   sc    mrs  fitzdottrel s speech possesses a  a noble and natural
eloquence   but the character of her husband is  almost too loathsome
to be ridiculous   and unfit  for the leading part in a comedy of
ethics as well as of morals    the prodigality of elaboration lavished
on such a multitude of subordinate characters  at the expense of all
continuous interest and to the sacrifice of all dramatic harmony  may
tempt the reader to apostrophize the poet in his own words 

    you are so covetous still to embrace
    more than you can  that you lose all 

yet a word of parting praise must be given to satan  a small part as
far as extent goes  but a splendid example of high comic imagination
after the order of aristophanes  admirably relieved by the low comedy
of the asinine pug and the voluble doggrel by the antiquated vice

an untranslateable german idiom  called the play  der dumme teufel

allowed to be twice as good as that of the english original  the

jonson makes use of this quotation again in his note  to the
reader  prefixed to act   of  the staple of news

      benson did not  take up freedom  until june            sta

poetry     mo  and the  execration against vulcan    to  cf   pub  of
grolier club   n  y        pp             the evidence that i  b  was
benson is strong  but not absolutely conclusive 

 robert allot   we find by arber s reprint of the
 stationer s register  that robert allot  took up freedom  nov    
      he must have begun publishing shortly after  for under the
date of jan             we find that mistris hodgettes  assigned
over unto him all her estate   consisting of the copies of certain
books  for the  some of forty five pounds   the first entry of a

the persons of the play 

 gvilt head  a gold smith   the goldsmiths seem to have
been a prosperous guild   see stow   survey   ed  thoms  p       
at this time they performed the office of banking  constituting the
intermediate stage between the usurer and the modern banker   the
goldsmiths began to borrow at interest in order to lend out to
traders at a higher rate  in other words they became the connecting
link between those who had money to lend and those who wished
to borrow for trading purposes  or it might be to improve their
estates  no doubt at first the goldsmiths merely acted as guardians
of their clients  hoards  but they soon began to utilize those hoards
much as bankers now make use of the money deposited with
them     social england

the prologue 

   the divell is an asse    this is said by the prologue pointing
to the  title  of the play  which as was then the custom  was
painted in large letters and placed in some conspicuous part of the
stage    g 

cf   poetaster    after the second sounding    what s here  the
arraignment   also  wily beguiled    prol   how now  my
honest rogue  what play shall we have here to night 

     player   sir  you may look upon the title 
     prol     what   spectrum  once again  

jonson often  but not invariably  announces the title of
the play in the prologue or induction  cf   every man out  
 cynthia s revels    poetaster   and all plays subsequent
to  bart  fair  except  sad shep  

   grandee s   jonson uses this affected form of address
again in  timber   ed  schelling        

   allowing vs no place   as gifford points out  the prologue is a
protest against the habit prevalent at the time of crowding the stage
with stools for the accommodation of the spectators 

dekker in chapter   of  the guls horne booke  gives the gallant full
instructions as to the behavior proper to the play house  the youth
is advised to wait until  the quaking prologue hath  by rubbing  got
culor into his cheekes   and then  to creepe from behind the arras  
and plant himself  on the very rushes where the commedy is to daunce 
yea  and vnder the state of cambises himselfe   sir john davies makes
a similar allusion   epigrams   ed  grosart          jonson makes
frequent reference to the subject  cf   induction  to  the staple
of news    every man out    wks           prologue  to  cynthia s
revels    wks           etc 

   a subtill thing   i  e   thin  airy  spiritual  and so not
occupying space 

   worne in a thumbe ring    nothing was more common  as we learn
from lilly  than to carry about familiar spirits  shut up in rings 
watches  sword hilts  and other articles of dress    g 

i have been unable to verify gifford s statement from lilly 
but the following passage from harsnet s  declaration   p     
confirms it   for compassing of this treasure  there was a
consociation betweene   or   priests   deuill coniurers   and
   discouerers   or  seers   reputed to carry about with them 
their familiars in rings  and glasses  by whose suggestion they
came to notice of those golden hoards  

gifford says that thumb rings of jonson s day were set with jewels
of an extraordinary size  and that they appear to have been  more
affected by magistrates and grave citizens than necromancers   cf 
 i henry iv         i could have crept into any alderman s thumb ring  
also  witts recreat     epig       

    he wears a hoop ring on his thumb  he has
    of gravidad a dose  full in the face 

glapthorne   wit in a constable                an alderman  i may
say to you  he has no more wit than the rest of the bench  and that
lies in his thumb ring  

   in compasse of a cheese trencher   the figure seems forced
to us  but it should be remembered that trenchers were a very
important article of table equipment in jonson s day  they were
often embellished with  posies   and it is possible that jonson was
thinking of the brevity of such inscriptions  cf  dekker   north ward
hoe         wks            ile have you make     poesies for a dozen
of cheese trenchers   also  honest whore   part i  sc      and
middleton   old law         wks             no wit  no help like a
woman s         wks           

    like the young adders   it is said that young adders  when
frightened  run into their mother s mouth for protection 

    would wee could stand due north   i  e   be as infallible as
the compass 

    muscouy glasse   cf  marston   malcontent    wks            she
were an excellent lady  but that her face peeleth like muscovy
glass   reed   old plays         quotes from giles fletcher s  russe
commonwealth         p       in the province of corelia  and about
the river duyna towards the north sea  there groweth a soft rock
which they call slude  this they cut into pieces  and so tear it
into thin  flakes  which naturally it is apt for   and so use it for
glasse lanthorns and such like  it giveth both inwards and outwards
a clearer light then glasse  and for this respect is better than
either glasse or horne  for that it neither breaketh like glasse  nor
yet will burne like the lanthorne   dekker   non dram  wks

the conventional way for the devil to make his appearance in the old
morality plays  gifford objects on the ground that  it is not the roar
of terror  but the boisterous expression of sarcastic merriment at the
absurd petition of pug   an objection  the truth of which does not
necessarily invalidate whalley s statement  jonson of course adapts the
old conventions to his own ends  see introduction  p  xxiii

originally a musical instrument  and was synonymous with rebec

          shee will not let you play round robbin   the expression
is obscure  and the dictionaries afford little help  round robin
is a common enough phrase  but none of the meanings recorded is
applicable in this connection  some child s game  played in a circle 
seems to be referred to  or the expression may be a cant term for
 play the deuce   robin is a name of many associations  and its
connection with robin hood  robin goodfellow  and  robert s men 
  the third old rank of the canting crew    grose   makes such an
interpretation more or less probable

          by a middlesex iury    a reproof no less severe than
merited  it appears from the records of those times  that many
unfortunate creatures were condemned and executed on charges of the
rediculous nature here enumerated  in many instances  the judge was
well convinced of the innocence of the accused  and laboured to
save them  but such were the gross and barbarous prejudices of the
juries  that they would seldom listen to his recommendations  and
he was deterred from shewing mercy  in the last place by the brutal
ferociousness of the people   whose teeth were set on edge with t

          whitechappell    till within memory the district north
of the high street was one of the very worst localities in london 
a region of narrow and filthy streets  yards and alleys  many of
them wholly occupied by thieves  dens  the receptacles of stolen
property  gin spinning dog holes  low brothels  and putrescent
lodging houses   a district unwholesome to approach and unsafe for
a decent person to traverse even in the day time    wh c

 to drinke with the dutch there  and take forth their patternes  
saint kathernes was the name of a hospital and precinct without
london  the hospital was said to have been founded by queen
matilda  wife of king stephen  in  the alchemist    wks     
      jonson speaks of its having been used  to keep the better
sort of mad folks   it was also employed as a reformatory for
fallen women  and it is here that winifred in  eastward ho   ed 
schelling  p      finds an appropriate landing place 

from this hospital there was  a continual street  or filthy
strait passage  with alleys of small tenements  or cottages 
built  inhabited by sailors  victuallers  along by the river of
thames  almost to radcliff  a good mile from the tower    stow 
ed  thoms  p      

the precinct was noted for its brew houses and low drinking
places  in  the staple of news  jonson speaks of  an ale wife in
saint katherine s  at the sign of the dancing bears    wks     
      the same tavern is referred to in the  masque of augurs 
as well as  the brew houses in st  katherine s   the sights of
the place are enumerated in the same masque 

the present passage seems to indicate that the precinct was largely
inhabited by dutch  in the  masque of augurs  vangoose speaks a sort
of dutch jargon  and we know that a flemish cemetery was located here
 see wh c   cf  also sir thomas overbury s  character of a drunken
dutchman resident in england   ed  morley  p       let him come over

herring   dutch weavers had been imported into england as early as
the reign of edward iii   see howes  p      a   and in the year

the phrase  to take forth their patternes  is somewhat obscure  and
seems to have been forced by the necessity for a rhyme  halliwell
says that  take forth  is equivalent to  learn   and the phrase seems
therefore to mean  take their measure    size them up   with a view
to following their example  it is possible  of course  that actual
patterns of the dutch weavers or tailors are referred to 

          custome house key   this was in tower street
on the thames side  stow  ed  thoms  pp         says that the
custom house was built in the sixth year of richard ii  jonson

          the dagger  and the wool sacke   these were two
ordinaries or public houses of low repute  especially famous
for their pies  there were two taverns called the  dagger   one
in holborn and one in cheapside  it is probably to the former
of these that jonson refers  it is mentioned again in the
 alchemist    wks         and      and in dekker s  satiromastix 
  wks            hotten says that the sign of a dagger was
common  and arose from its being a charge in the city arms

mentions the tradition that the name was derived from that of
belin  king of the britons  but discredits it  billingsgate is
on the thames  a little below london bridge  and is still the
great fish market of london 

          shoot the bridge   the waterway under the old
london bridge was obstructed by the narrowness of the arches 
by cornmills built in some of the openings  and by the great
waterworks at its southern end   of the arches left open some
were too narrow for the passage of boats of any kind  the widest
was only    feet  and the resistance caused to so large a body
of water on the rise and fall of the tide by this contraction of
its channel produced a fall or rapid under the bridge  so that
it was necessary to  ship oars  to  shoot the bridge   as it was
called   an undertaking  to amateur watermen especially  not
unattended with danger   with the flood tide it was impossible 
and with the ebb tide dangerous to pass through or  shoot  the
arches of the bridge   in the latter case prudent passengers
landed above the bridge  generally at the  old swan stairs   and
walked to some wharf  generally  billingsgate   below it    wh c

pepys visited the place on january           and describes the best

he seems  however  to have been rather an improviser like
vennor  or a mountebank with a gift of riming  he is mentioned

corrected his statement in the  masque of augurs    wks          
he says   fenner  whom i supposed to be a juggler  was a rude kind
of  improvisatore   he was altogether ignorant  but possessed a
wonderful facility in pouring out doggrel verse  he says of himself 

    yet  without boasting  let me boldly say
    i ll rhyme with any man that breathes this day
    upon a subject  in  extempore   etc 

he seems to have made a wretched livelihood by frequenting city
feasts   c   where  at the end of the entertainment  he was called in
to mount a stool and amuse the company by stringing together a
number of vile rhymes upon any given subject  to this the quotation
alludes  fenner is noticed by the duchess of newcastle   for
the numbers every schoolboy can make them on his fingers  and for
the  rime   fenner would put down ben jonson  and yet neither boy
nor fenner so good poets   this  too  is the person meant in the

    a ballad late was made 
    but god knows who the penner 
    some say the rhyming sculler 
    and others say  twas fenner  p     

fenner was so famed for his faculty of rhyming  that james  who 
like bartholomew cokes  would willingly let no raree show escape
him  sent for him to court  upon which fenner added to his other
titles that of his  majesty s riming poet   this gave offense to
taylor  the water poet  and helped to produce that miserable
squabble printed among his works  and from which i have principally
derived the substance of this note    g

the controversy referred to may be found in the spenser society s
reprint of the      folio of taylor s  works         pp          
here may be gathered a few more facts regarding the life of
fenner  or fennor as it should be spelled   among them that he
was apprenticed when a boy to a blind harper  in the quarrel  it
must be confessed  fennor does not appear markedly inferior to his
derider either in powers of versification or in common decency  the
quarrel between the poets took place in october        and fennor s
admittance to court seems to be referred to in the present passage 

          a sheriffes dinner   this was an occasion of considerable
extravagance  entick   survey          tells us that in      a

in a time of scarcity  whereby it was ordained  that the lord mayor
should not have more than seven dishes at dinner or supper   and  an

meant by  new nothing  i do not know  from the construction it would
seem to indicate the place from which the fool was accustomed to take
his leap  but it is possible that the word should be connected with
 rime   and may perhaps be the translation of a greek or latin title
for some book of  facetiae  published about this time  such wits as
fennor and taylor doubtless produced many pamphlets  the titles of
which have not been recorded  in      taylor brought out a collection
of verse called  sir gregory non sense his newes from no place   and
it may have been this very book in manuscript that suggested jonson s
title  in the play of  king darius         one of the actors says

entertainments  to leap into a large bowl of custard set on
purpose    w  whalley refers also to  all s well that ends well 
       you have made a shift to run into it  boots and all  like
him that leapt into the custard  

gifford quotes glapthorne   wit in a const   

    the custard  with the four and twenty nooks
    at my lord mayor s feast 

he continues   indeed  no common supply was required  for  besides
what the corporation  great devourers of custard  consumed on the
spot  it appears that it was thought no breach of city manners to
send  or take some of it home with them for the use of their ladies  
in the excellent old play quoted above  clara twits her uncle with
this practise 

    now shall you  sir  as  tis a frequent custom 
     cause you re a worthy alderman of a ward 
    feed me with custard  and perpetual white broth
    sent from the lord mayor s feast  

cunningham says   poets of a comparatively recent date continue to
associate mayors and custards   he quotes prior   alma   cant     and
a letter from bishop warburton to hurd  apr          i told him  the
lord mayor  in what i thought he was defective  that i was greatly
disappointed to see no custard at table  he said that they had been
so ridiculed for their custard that none had ventured to make its
appearance for some years   jonson mentions the  quaking custards

         gresham   a pretended astrologer  contemporary with forman 
and said to be one of the associates of the infamous countess of
essex and mrs  turner in the murder of sir thomas overbury  arthur
wilson mentions him in  the life of james i    p     

 mrs   turner   the mistris of the  work   had lost both her
supporters   forman   her first prop  drop t away suddenly by death 
and  gresham  another rotten  engin   that succeded him  did not hold
long  she must now bear up all her self  

he is mentioned twice in spark s  narrative history of king james  
somer s  tracts           dr  forman being dead  mrs  turner wanted
one to assist her  whereupon  at the countesses coming to london  one
gresham was nominated to be entertained in this businesse  and  in
processe of time  was wholly interested in it  this man was had in
suspition to have had a hand in the gunpowder plot  he wrote so near
it in his almanack  but  without all question  he was a very skilful
man in the mathematicks  and  in his latter time  in witchcraft  as
was suspected  and therefore the fitter to bee imployed in those
practises  which  as they were devilish  so the devil had a hand
in them  

 ibid         now gresham growing into years  having spent much time
in many foule practises to accomplish those things at this time 
gathers all his babies together   viz   pictures in lead  in wax  in
plates of gold  of naked men and women with crosses  crucifixes  and
other implements  wrapping them all up together in a scarfe  crossed
every letter in the sacred word trinity  crossed these things very
holily delivered into the hands of one weston to bee hid in the earth
that no man might find them  and so in thames street having finished
his evill times he died  leaving behind him a man and a maid  one
hanged for a witch  and the other for a thief very shortly after  

in the  heads of charges against robert  earl of somerset  
drawn up by lord bacon  we read   that the countess laboured
forman and gresham to inforce the queen by witchcraft to favour
the countess   howell s  state trials           to this king

of francklin

lord would seek some public or private revenge against her  by
the advice of the before mentioned mrs  turner  consulted and
practised with doctor forman and doctor savory  two conjurers 
about the poisoning of him    d ewes   autobiog            

he was employed after the sudden death of dr  forman  wright
  sorcery and magic   p       says that the name is written
lavoire in some manuscripts   mrs  turner also confessed  that
dr  savories was used in succession  after forman  and practised
many sorceries upon the earle of essex his person    spark 
 narrative history   somer s  tracts         

in the  calendar of state papers  the name of  savery  appears
four times  under date of oct            we find dr  savery
examined on a charge of  spreading popish books    savery
pretends to be a doctor  but is probably a conjurer   and again
under the same date he is interrogated as to his relations with
mrs  turner and forman  under oct     he replies to coke   oct 
   we find dr  savery questioned as to his  predictions of
troubles and alterations in court   this is the last mention
of him 

just what connection gresham and savory had with the overbury
plot is a difficult matter to determine  both are spoken of as
following forman immediately  and of neither is any successor
mentioned except the actual poisoner  franklin  it seems
probable that gresham was the first to be employed after forman 
and that his own speedy death led to the selection of savory 
how the latter managed to escape a more serious implication in
the trial it is difficult to conceive 

           christalls      characters   as in other fields 
jonson is well versed in magic lore  lumps of crystal were one
of the regular means of raising a demon  bk      ch     of
scot s  discovery of witchcraft         is entitled   to make a
spirit appear in a christall   and ch     shows  how to enclose
a spirit in a christall stone  

lilly   history   p      speaks of the efficacy of  a
constellated ring  in sickness  and they were doubtless
considered effective in more sinister dealings  jonson has
already spoken of the devil being carried in a thumb ring
 see note p     

charms were usually written on parchment  in barrett s  magus  
bk     pt          we read that the pentacle should be drawn
 upon parchment made of a kid skin  or virgin  or pure clean
white paper  

that parts of the human body belonged to the sorcerer s
paraphernalia is shown by the statute   jac  i  c  xii  which
contains a clause forbidding conjurors to  take up any dead
man woman or child out of his her or their grave     or the
skin bone or any other parte of any dead person  to be imployed
or used in any manner of witchcrafte sorcerie charme or
inchantment  

the wing of the raven  as a bird of ill omen  may be an
invention of jonson s own  the lighting of candles within the
magic circle is mentioned below  note           

most powerful of all was the pentacle  of which scot s
 discovery   ap  ii  p          furnishes an elaborate
description  this figure was used by the pythagorean school as
their seal  and is equivalent to the pentagram or five pointed
star  see  cd    

dekker   wks           connects it with the periapt as a  potent
charm   and marlowe speaks of it in  hero and leander  
 wks         

    a rich disparent pentacle she wears 
    drawn full of circles and strange characters 

it will be remembered that the inscription of a pentagram on the
threshold prevents the escape of mephistopheles in goethe s  faust  
the editors explain its potency as due to the fact that it is
resolvable into three triangles  and is thus a triple sign of the
trinity 

cunningham says that the pentacle  when delineated upon the body of a
man was supposed to point out the five wounds of the saviour   w  j 
thoms   anecdotes   camden soc         p      speaks of its presence
in the western window of the southern aisle of westminster abbey  an
indication that the monks were versed in occult science 

          if they be not   gifford refers to chrysippus   de
divinatione   lib            this is the very syllogism by which that
acute philosopher triumphantly proved the reality of augury

found necessary in      to pass an act     hen  viii  c     by

 social england   p       quotes from ms  lansdowne     art 
    a deposition from william wicherley  conjurer  in which he
places the number of conjurers in england in      above five

most frequently mentioned among the arts of the conjurer  scot

subject  in which he enjoins the conjurer to draw a double
circle with his own blood  to divide the circle into seven
parts and to set at each division a  candle lighted in a

gifford s note on this passage is   this proverbial phrase is
found in most  sic  of our ancient dramas  thus in  the wise
woman of hogsden    you are the wise woman  are you  you  have
wit to keep yourself warm enough   i warrant you    cf  also

          you lade me    this is equivalent to the modern
phrase  you do not spare me  you lay what imputations you please
upon me    g 

the phrase occurs again in            where wittipol calls
fitzdottrel an ass  and says that he cannot  scape his lading  
 you lade me   then  seems to mean  you make an ass of me  
the same use of the word occurs in dekker   olde fortunatus

he cannot have a minute beyond the quarter of an hour allowed him

          a niaise   gifford says that the side note  could scarcely
come from jonson  for it explains nothing  a niaise  or rather
an  eyas   of which it is a corruption  is unquestionably a young hawk 
but the niaise of the poet is the french term for   a simple  witless 
inexperienced gull    c  the word is very common in our old
writers  

the last statement is characteristic of gifford  it would have been
well in this case if he had given some proof of his assertion  the
derivation  an eyas     a nyas  is probably incorrect  the  centary
dictionary  gives   niaise    nyas   and corruptly  eyas   by
misdivision of  a nias     the best explanation i can give of the side
note is this  the glossator takes the meaning  simpleton  for granted 
but fitzdottrel has just said  laught at  sweet bird   in explanation
the side note is added  this  perhaps  does not help matters much and 
indeed  i am inclined to believe with gifford that the side notes are

any time these two and twenty years   gifford says on this passage

constantly used the word for a person employed in love messages  a
go between in the worst sense  and only differing from a bawd in not
being stationary   a glance at the examples given above will show 
however  that the term was much more elastic than this explanation
would indicate 

the dictionaries give no suggestion of the origin of the metaphor

          your almanack men   an excellent account of the
almanac makers of the   th century is given by h  r  plomer in
 n    q    th ser           from which the following is abridged 

 almanac making had become an extensive and profitable trade
in this country at the beginning of the   th century  and with
the exception of some fifteen or twenty years at the time of
the rebellion continued to flourish until its close  there
were three distinct classes of almanacs published during the
seventeenth century  the common almanacs  which preceded and
followed the period of the rebellion  and the political and
satirical almanacs that were the direct outcome of that event 

 the common almanacs came out year after year in unbroken
uniformity  they were generally of octavo size and consisted
of two parts  an almanac and a prognostication  good and evil
days were recorded  and they contained rules as to bathing 
purging  etc   descriptions of the four seasons and rules to
know the weather  and during the latter half of the century an
astrological prediction and  scheme  of the ensuing year 

 in the preceding century the makers of almanacs were  physitians and
preests   but they now adopted many other titles  such as  student in
astrology    philomath    well willer to the mathematics   the majority
of them were doubtless astrologers  but not a few were quack doctors 
who only published their almanacs as advertisements    almanac  a
character in  the staple of news   is described as a  doctor in
physic   

among the more famous almanac makers the names of william lilly  john
partridge and bretnor may be mentioned  for the last see note      
   and b    fl    rollo  duke of normandy   where fiske and bretnor
appear again  cf  also  alchemist    wks           every man out

of his book have a worse pace than ever had rochester hackney  for his
prose   tis dappled with ink horn terms  and may serve for an almanac 
but for his judging at the uncertainty of weather  any old shepherd

              the receiu d heresie  that england beares no dukes  
 i know not when this  heresy  crept in  there was apparently some
unwillingness to create dukes  as a title of honour  in the norman
race  probably because the conqueror and his immediate successors were
dukes of normandy  and did not choose that a subject should enjoy
similar dignities with themselves  the first of the english who bore
the title was edward the black prince   son of edward iii   who was
created duke of cornwall  by charter  as collins says  in       the
dignity being subsequently conferred on several of the blood royal 
and of the nobility  who came to untimely ends  an idea seems to have
been entertained by the vulgar  that the title itself was ominous  at
the accession of james i  to the crown of this country  there was  i
believe  no english peer of ducal dignity    g 

the last duke had been created in the reign of henry viii   who made
his illegitimate son the duke of richmond  and charles brandon  who
married his sister mary  duke of suffolk  after the attainder and

              though they take master fitz dottrell  i am no
such foule   gifford points out that the punning allusion of
 foul  to  fowl  is a play upon the word dottrel   the dotterel
 fuller tells us  is avis             a mirth making bird 
so ridiculously mimical  that he is easily caught  or rather
catcheth himself by his over active imitation  as the fowler
stretcheth forth his arms and legs  stalking towards the bird 
so the bird extendeth his legs and wings  approaching the fowler
till he is surprised in the net    g 

this is what is alluded to in           the use of the metaphor is
common  gifford quotes beaumont   fletcher   bonduca  and  sea voyage  
many examples are given in nares and the  ned    to which may be added

    met her with all expressions 

it is uncertain whether the sense of  bird  or  simpleton  is
the original   dottrel  seems to be connected with  dote  and
 dotard   the bird is a species of plover  and cunningham says
that  selby ridicules the notion of its being more stupid than

           picardill   cotgrave gives   piccadilles  piccadilles 
the severall divisions or peeces fastened together about the brimme
of the collar of a doublet   c   gifford says   with respect to the
 piccadil   or  as jonson writes it  picardil   as if he supposed the
fashion of wearing it be derived from picardy   the term is simply a
diminutive of picca  span  and ital   a spear head  and was given to
this article of foppery  from a fancied resemblance of its stiffened
plaits to the bristled points of those weapons  blount thinks  and
apparently with justice  that piccadilly took its name from the sale
of the  small stiff collars  so called   which was first set on foot
in a house near the western extremity of the present street  by one
higgins  a tailor  

as gifford points out   pug is affecting modesty  since he had
not only assumed a handsome body  but a fashionable dress   made
new  for a particular occasion   see

          crowland   crowland  or croyland is an ancient town
and parish of lincolnshire  situated in a low flat district  about
eight miles north east from peterborough  the origin of crowland was
in a hermitage founded in the  th century by st  guthlac  an abbey
was founded in     by king ethelbald  which was twice burnt and
restored 

         spenser  i thinke  the younger   thomas            
was the only member of the despenser family who was an earl of
gloucester  the person referred to here  however  is hugh le
despenser  the younger baron  son of hugh le despenser  the elder 
he married eleanor  daughter of gilbert of clare  earl of gloucester 
and sister and coheiress of the next earl gilbert  after the
death of the latter  the inheritance was divided between the husbands
of his three sisters  and despenser was accordingly sometimes called
earl of gloucester 

despenser was at first on the side of the barons  but later joined
the king s party  in      a league was formed against him  and he
was banished  but was recalled in the following year  in the
barons  rising of      he was taken prisoner  brought to hereford 
tried and put to death 

         thomas of woodstocke   thomas of woodstock  earl
of buckingham            the youngest son of edward iii   was
made duke of gloucester by his nephew  richard ii   in       and
later acquired an extraordinary influence  dominating the affairs of
england for several years  by his high handed actions he incurred
richard s enmity  he was arrested july           and conveyed to
calais  where he was murdered in the following september by the
king s order 

          duke humphrey   humphrey  called the good duke
humphrey              youngest son of henry iv   was created
duke of gloucester and earl of pembroke in       during the
minority of henry vi  he acted as protector of the kingdom  his
career was similar to that of thomas of woodstock  in      he
was arrested at bury by order of henry vi   who had become king
in       here he died in february  probably by a natural death 
although there were suspicions of foul play 

          richard the third   richard iii               duke of
gloucester and king of england  was defeated and slain in the battle
of bosworth field       

            mer  by     authentique   this passage has been
the occasion of considerable discussion  the subject was first
approached by malone  in a note to an essay on  the order of
shakespeare s plays  in his edition of shakespeare s works  ed 
              he says   in  the devil s an ass   acted in      
all his historical plays are obliquely censured  

again in a dissertation on  henry vi     the malignant ben  does
indeed  in his  devil s an ass         sneer at our author s
historical pieces  which for twenty years preceding had been in high
reputation  and probably were  then  the only historical dramas that
had possession of the theatre  but from the list above given  it is
clear that shakespeare was not the  first  who dramatized our old
chronicles  and that the principal events of english history were
familiar to the ears of his audience  before he commenced a writer
for the stage   malone here refers to quotations taken from gosson
and lodge  both these essays were reprinted in steevens  edition  and
malone s statements were repeated in the edition by dr  chalmers 

in      appeared gilchrist s essay   an examination of the
charges     of ben jonson s enmity   etc   towards shakespeare  
this refutation  strengthened by gifford s  proofs of ben
jonson s malignity   has generally been deemed conclusive 
gifford s note on the present passage is written with much
asperity  he was not content  however  with an accurate
restatement of malone s arguments  he changes the italics in
order to produce an erroneous impression  printing thus   which
were probably then the  only historical dramas on the stage  
he adds   and this is advanced in the very face of his own
arguments  to prove that there were scores  perhaps hundreds  of
others on it at the time   this is direct falsification  there
is no contradiction in malone s arguments  what he attempted
to prove was that shakespeare had had predecessors in this
field  but that in      his plays held undisputed possession
of the stage  gifford adds a passage from heywood s  apology
for actors         which is more to the point   plays have
taught the unlearned the knowledge of many famous  histories  
instructed such as cannot read in the discovery of our  english
chronicles   and what man have you now of that weake capacity
that being possest of their true use  cannot discourse of any
notable thing recorded even from  william the conqueror   until
this day  

this passage seems to point to the existence of other historical plays
 contemporary  with those of shakespeare  besides  jonson s words
seem sufficiently harmless  nevertheless  although i am not inclined
to accept malone s charge of  malignity   i cannot agree with gifford
that the reference is merely a general one  i have no doubt that the
 chronicle   of which merecraft speaks  is hall s  and the passage
the following   it semeth to many men  that the name and title of
gloucester  hath been vnfortunate and vnluckie to diuerse  whiche
for their honor  haue been erected by creacion of princes  to that
stile and dignitie  as hugh spencer  thomas of woodstocke  sonne to
kyng edward the third  and this duke humfrey  which thre persones 
by miserable death finished their daies  and after them kyng richard
the iii  also  duke of gloucester  in ciuill warre was slaine and
confounded  so y t this name of gloucester  is take for an vnhappie
and vnfortunate stile  as the prouerbe speaketh of seianes horse 
whose rider was euer unhorsed  and whose possessor was euer brought to
miserie   hall s  chronicle   ed        pp          the passage in  the
play bookes  which jonson satirizes is at the close of    henry vi     
  

       edw   richard  i will create thee duke of gloucester 
    and george  of clarence  warwick  as ourself 
    shall do and undo as him pleaseth best 
       rich   let me be duke of clarence  george of gloucester 
    for gloucester s dukedom is too ominous 

the last line  of course  corresponds to the   tis fatal  of
fitzdottrel  furthermore it may be observed that thomas of
woodstock s death at calais is referred to in shakespeare s  k 
rich  ii    duke humphrey appears in    henry iv     henry v   
and     and    henry vi    and richard iii  in     and    henry
vi   and  k  rich  iii      henry vi   is probably  however  not
of shakespearean authorship

admirably turned by pope 

    shades that to bacon might retreat afford 
    become the portion of a booby lord 
    and helmsley  once proud buckingham s delight

          and garters which are lost  if shee can shew  hem  
gifford thinks the line should read   can not shew   cunningham gives
a satisfactory explanation   as i understand this it means that if a
gallant once saw the garters he would never rest until he obtained
possession of them  and they would thus be  lost  to the family 
garters thus begged from the ladies were used by the gallants as
 hangers  for their swords and poniards  see  every man out of his
humour    wks           o  i have been graced by them beyond all aim
of affection  this is her garter my dagger hangs in   and again p 
     we read also in  cynthia s revels    wks           of a gallant
whose devotion to a lady in such that he

                              salutes her pumps 
    adores her hems  her skirts  her knots  her curls 
     will spend his patrimony for a garter  
    or the least feather in her bounteous fan  

gifford s theory that ladies had some mode of displaying their
garters is contradicted by the following 

     mary   these roses will shew rare  would  twere in fashion
    that the garters might be seen too 
                             massinger   city madam    wks    p

          and done the worst defeate vpon my selfe    defeat  is often
used by shakespeare in this sense  see schmidt  and compare  hamlet

          you make me paint   gifford quotes from the  two noble
kinsmen  

    how modestly she blows and paints the sun
    with her chaste blushes 

          sn    whoever has noticed the narrow streets or
rather lanes of our ancestors  and observed how story projected
beyond story  till the windows of the upper rooms almost touched
on different sides  will easily conceive the feasibility of
everything which takes place between wittipol and his mistress 
though they make their appearance in different houses    g 

i cannot believe that jonson wished to represent the two houses
as on opposite sides of the street  he speaks of them as
 contiguous   which would naturally mean side by side  further
than this  one can hardly imagine even in the  narrow lanes of
our ancestors  so close a meeting that the liberties mentioned
in          sn  could be taken 

          a strange woman   in  bart  fair    wks          
justice overdo says   rescue this youth here out of the hands
of the lewd man and  the strange woman    gifford explains in a
note   the scripture phrase for an immodest woman  a prostitute 
indeed this acceptation of the word is familiar to many
languages  it is found in the greek  and we have in terence  pro
 uxore habere hanc  peregrinam  upon which donatus remarks   hoc
nomine etiam  meretrices  nominabantur

ripened kisses on her lips  fit for a mercury to gather  and made
her language sweeter than his upon her tongue  was not the girdle
about her  he was to untie  my mother s  wherein all the joys and     
delights of love were woven 

     cup   and did not i bring on the blushing bridegroom to taste
those joys  and made him think all stay a torment  did i not
shoot myself into him like a flame  and made his desires and his
graces equal  were not his looks of power to have kept the night      
alive in contention with day  and made the morning never wished
for  was there a curl in his hair  that i did not sport in  or a
ring of it crisped  that might not have become juno s fingers  his
very undressing  was it not love s arming  did not all his kisses

    hast thou seen the down in the air

    or the ship on the sea 
        when ruder winds have crossed it 
    hast thou marked the crocodile s weeping

     the source of that passage is evidently martial   epig          

    loto candidior puella cygno 
    argento  nive  lilio  ligustro 

in this place jonson seems to have more particularly in mind  epig  
      

    puella senibus dulcior mibi cygnis    
    cui nec lapillos praeferas erythraeos     
    nivesque primas liliumque non tactum

appellation of  bedfellow   which appears strange to us  was
common among the ancient nobility   he quotes from  a knack
to know a knave          look about you          cynthia s

of  intimate companion  and applied to nobles  jonson uses the

          dicke robinson   collier says   this player may have
been an original actor in some of shakespeare s later dramas  and
he just outlived the complete and final suppression of the stage  
his death and the date at which it occurred have been matters of
dispute 

his earliest appearance in any list of actors is at the end of
jonson s  catiline         with the king s majesty s servants 
he was probably the youngest member of the company  and
doubtless sustained a female part  gifford believes that he took
the part of wittipol in the present play  though this is merely
a conjecture   the only female character he is known to have
filled is the lady of giovanus in  the second maiden s tragedy  
but at what date is uncertain  neither do we know at what period
he began to represent male characters   of the plays in which
he acted  collier mentions beaumont and fletcher s  bonduca  
 double marriage    wife for a month   and  wild goose chase 
        and webster s  duchess of malfi        

his name is found in the patent granted by james i  in      and
in that granted by charles i  in       between      and      no
notice of him occurs  and this is the last date at which we hear of
him   his name follows that of lowin in the dedication to the folio
of beaumont and fletcher s works  published at that time    collier 
 memoirs   p      

jonson not infrequently refers to contemporary actors  compare
the  epitaph on salathiel pavy    ep        the speech of venus
in  the masque of christmas    wks           and the reference
to field and burbage in  bart  fair       

          send frolicks     frolics  are couplets 
commonly of an amatory or satirical nature  written on small
slips of paper  and wrapt round a sweetmeat  a dish of them is
usually placed on the table after supper  and the guests amuse
themselves with sending them to one another  as circumstances
seem to render them appropriate  this is occasionally productive
of much mirth  i do not believe that the game is to be found in
england  though the drawing on twelfth night may be thought to

company  formed a separate organization  the place of practice
was the artillery garden in bunhill fields  see note           
in spite of ridicule the train bands proved a source of strength
during the civil war  see clarendon   hist  of the rebellion

the immediate occasion of jonson s satire was doubtless the
revival of military enthusiasm in       of which entick
  survey          gives the following account 

 the military genius of the  londoners  met with an opportunity 
about this time  to convince the world that they still retained the
spirit of their forefathers  should they be called out in the cause
of their king and country  his majesty having commanded a general
muster of the militia throughout the kingdom  the city of  london 
not only mustered      citizens completely armed  who performed their
several evolutions with surprizing dexterity  but a martial spirit
appeared amongst the rising generation  the children endeavoured
to imitate their parents  chose officers  formed themselves into
companies  marched often into the fields with colours flying and beat
of drums  and there  by frequent practice  grew up expert in the
military exercises

attended  that the  blue coats   or attendants  of the courtiers

on this passage   wks           ed        gifford advanced the
theory that the  bullion  was  a piece of finery  which derived
its denomination from the large globular gilt buttons  still in
use on the continent   in his note on the present passage  he
adds that it was probably  adopted by gamblers and others  as a
mark of wealth  to entrap the unwary

  bullion   copper plates set on the breast leathers and bridles
of horses for ornament   phillips         i suspect that it also
meant  in colloquial use  copper lace  tassels  and ornaments in

          f  decayes the fore teeth  that should guard the tongue  
etc  cf   timber   ed  schelling           it was excellently said of
that philosopher  that there was a wall or parapet of teeth set in
our mouth  to restrain the petulancy of our words  that the rashness
of talking should not only be retarded by the guard and watch of our
heart  but be fenced in and defended by certain strengths placed in
the mouth itself  and within the lips  

professor schelling quotes plutarch   moralia  de garrulitate    
translated by goodwin   and yet there is no member of human bodies
that nature has so strongly enclosed within a double fortification
as the tongue  entrenched within a barricade of sharp teeth  to the
end that  if it refuses to obey and keep silent when reason  presses
the glittering reins  within  we should fix our teeth in it till the
blood comes rather than suffer inordinate and unseasonable din     
     

          mad dames   see variants  the editors have taken out of

            see variants  there are several mistakes in the
assignment of speeches throughout this act  not all of gifford s
changes  however  are to be accepted without question  evidently 
if the question  where   is to be assigned to wittipol  the first
speech must be an aside  as it is inconceivable that merecraft should
introduce fitzdottrel first under his own name  and then as the
 duke of drown d land  

my conception of the situation is this  pug is playing the part
of gentleman usher  he enters and announces to merecraft that
fitzdottrel and his wife are coming  merecraft whispers   master
fitzdottrel and his wife  where   and then  as they enter  turns to

                  there is one thing vsed of the venetian women  and
some others dwelling in the cities and towns subject to the signiory
of venice  that is not to be obserued  i thinke  amongst any other
women in christendome  which is so common in venice  that no woman
whatsoeuer goeth without it  either in her house or abroad  a thing
made of wood  and couered with leather of sundry colors  some with
white  some redde  some yellow  it is called a chapiney  which they
weare vnder their shoes  many of them are curiously painted  some
also i haue seene fairely gilt  so vncomely a thing  in my opinion 
that it is pitty this foolish custom is not cleane banished and
exterminated out of the citie  there are many of these chapineys of a
great heigth  euen half a yard high  which maketh many of their women
that are very short  seeme much taller then the tallest women we haue
in england  also i haue heard that this is obserued amongst them 
that by how much the nobler a woman is  by so much the higher are her
chapineys  all their gentlewomen  and most of their wiues and widowes
that are of any wealth  are assisted and supported eyther by men or
women when they walke abroad  to the end they may not fall  they
are borne vp most commonly by the left arme  otherwise they might
quickly take a fall  for i saw a woman fall a very dangerous fall as
she was going down the staires of one of the little stony bridges
with her high chapineys alone by her selfe  but i did nothing pitty
her  because shee wore such friuolous and  as i may truely term them 
ridiculous instruments  which were the occasion of her fall  for both
i myselfe  and many other strangers  as i haue obserued in venice 
haue often laughed at them for their vaine chapineys

           daunce the saraband   the origin of the saraband is in
doubt  being variously attributed to spain and to the moors  it
is found in europe at the beginning of the sixteenth century  and
its immoral character is constantly referred to  grove   dict  of
music          quotes from chapter      del baile y cantar llamado
zarabanda   of the  tratado contra los juegos publicos    treatise
against public amusements   of mariana               entre las otras
invenciones ha salido estos a os un baile y cantar tan lacivo en las
palabras  tan feo en las meneos  que basta para pegar fuego aun   las
personas muy honestas    amongst other inventions there has appeared
during late years a dance and song  so lascivious in its words  so
ugly in its movements  that it is enough to inflame even very modest
people     this reputation was not confined to spain  for marini in
his poem  l adone         says 

    chiama questo suo gioco empio e profano
    saravanda  e ciaccona  il nuova ispano 

padre mariana  who believed in its spanish origin  says that its
invention was one of the disgraces of the nation  and other authors
attribute its invention directly to the devil  the dance was attacked
by cervantes and guevara  and defended by lope de vega  but it seems
to have been so bad that at the end of the reign of philip ii  it was
for a time suppressed  it was soon  however  revived in a purer form
and was introduced at the french court in        grove           

in england the saraband was soon transformed into an ordinary
country dance  two examples are to be found in the first edition of
playford s  dancing master   and sir john hawkins   hist  of the
science and practice of music         speaks of it several times 
 within the memory of persons now living   he says  a saraband
danced by a moor was constantly a part of the entertainment at a
puppet show            in another place           in speaking of the
use of castanets at a puppet show  he says   that particular dance
called the saraband is supposed to require as a thing of necessity 
the music  if it may be called so  of this artless instrument
